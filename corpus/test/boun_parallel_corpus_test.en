The purpose of this book is to explore several examples of the kind of life and the type of character that the nations of ignorance have produced, and to show that every approach it has formulated has come to an impasse. 
Spiritually, they are in a quagmire; the solution they have devised for themselves is to ignore the proofs of Allah's existence, and to keep the matter from their minds. 
We have given these people enjoyment, as We did their fathers, until life seemed long and good to them... 
What is with Allah is better and longer lasting …(Surat ahShura, 36) 
Yet the life of this world, compared to the Hereafter, is only fleeting enjoyment. 
Rather, they offer unfounded excuses in order to deceive themselves and quiet their consciences. 
He is the Creator, the AllKnowing. 
The greatest of these difficulties, however, is suffered within themselves. 
That is because, everything they try is always merely a product of their ignorance. 
After a certain time, some will settle into a particular identity. 
We are not referring to these individuals, but only those who reflect the endemic corruption that plagues the societies of ignorance. 
What is this power, then, to which the ignorant are so attached, and which commands them so absolutely? 
So, in the same way, the "female character" is defined by the characteristics regarded as acceptable for women in the society. 
Girls are brought up from a very early age with this idea instilled in their minds. 
For a middleincome family, these plans include a private home, for which they do not have to pay rent, and being able to pay electricity and water bills, and their children's school expenses; one day they may even be able to own a car and buy new furnishings for the house. 
Such people make plans with regards to their homes, families and children. 
The most important considerations that give their life meaning are living in a beautiful house, having their children study in a good school, and buying a car for the family, that they can show off. Certainly, it is not a blameworthy thing for a person to be interested in their home. 
Real life happens in quite a different way than they expect. 
They all lead their lives according to their early observations and experiences. 
Even the ideal of a young woman, who has studied at university, and though she has a network of friends, may become an entirely different personality after she marries. 
A misspoken word, a joking remark, or sometimes, just the wrong word will fix in her mind, and lead her to become emotional. 
Financial difficulties in the family, difficulties in raising the children, soap operas, or many other factors, may provide the excuse for them to yield to this side of their character. 
This is the recompense Allah has given them for choosing ignorance instead of the moral teachings of the Qur'an. 
Women who continually find something to be miserable about and cry for, in this world, should remember that they may be doomed to lead a life of endless misery in the Afterlife, because they had been ungrateful for all the blessings conferred by Allah upon human beings. 
These women harbor many subconscious fears, and are afraid of being neglected, abandoned or deceived. 
This psychological condition creates tension and often leads heated arguments. 
But, it must be noted that these women knowingly chose this life themselves. 
Satan is an outright enemy to man. 
For an individual to be jealous in a loving relationship is contrary to the teaching of the Qur'an. 
However, Allah has forbidden human beings from gossiping. 
You who believe! Avoid most suspicion. Indeed some suspicion is a crime. 
At such gatherings, it is sufficient to lift their spirits merely to receive a compliment about a cake they baked, but, if their husbands do not give them permission to attend one of these meetings, they would stay miserable for weeks. 
This demonstrates just how petty and narrow is their world. 
Believers are commanded in the Qur'an to refrain from idle talk, and nonproductive activities, but to spend every moment towards doing something useful and thinking about how they may be helpful to others. 
However, what they watch is most often of no value. 
For this reason, their daily schedule is organized around the times when these soap operas are broadcast, and if they have to go anywhere, they ensure that they record the episode on videocassette. 
Even if they were offered better quality programming, with more intelligent content so as to broaden their horizons, these women, being far removed from the morality of the true religion, would still not give up their soap operas. 
Because these programs reflect their aspirations, pleasures and their outlook on life so well. 
These women could do something positive, but never do, nor are they uncomfortable about it, because their lack of sense of purpose and their selfimage as housewife is so ingrained. 
These telephone conversations go on for hours but, generally, they accomplish nothing fruitful. 
Lying, fraud, deceit and all sorts of other moral deficiencies are regarded by them as normal. 
There will come a point, however, where this corruption will turn on them. 
For instance, while they are themselves gossiping, others are talking about them. 
They have no experience of loyalty, either in their friendships or in their marriages; they do not trust even their husbands. 
If they had lived a life pleasing to Allah, and kept to the moral precepts that He has commanded, they would certainly have enjoyed the reward that comes from living a good life. 
Other factors in the society help to support this notion of male superiority. 
This creates the idea that male selfsufficiency is absolute. 
It must also be noted that the strength, bravery and other traits expected of a man in society are not negative characteristics; they are actually all good and positive. 
Various Examples of the Male Character in a Society of Ignorance 
What we have said so far describes the aspects of the male character in a society of ignorance. 
Because the men now have nothing to do, they become bored sitting in the house all day with nothing to occupy themselves. 
The fact that they still long for the life of ignorance, even when death is so close, is a typical feature of the character of an elderly person who lives in a society removed from religion. 
And, they raised their children and grandchildren to adopt the same moral outlook. Instead of instilling in them the nobler morality that Allah has commanded, they have taught them the morality of ignorance. 
The parents are aware of the way their children feel towards them, and this gives rise to one of the major character traits of the elderly—they are irascible. They know that their presence is not appreciated by those they have been taken in by, and so try as much as they can not to bother other members of the household. 
They get angry about the slightest remark, collecting their things feigning to get ready to leave. 
They behave in such a way only to make others feel sorry for them. 
Even when someone buys them a present they find something to take offense at. 
Every individual who lives in a society divorced from religion is evaluated according to his profession, social status and degree of prosperity. 
For this reason, those in a society of ignorance who are faced with making a decision about what profession to pursue make their choice not only on the basis of what interests them, or what their talents are, but also consider the social status it will bring. 
The Character of the Working Woman According to the Morality of Ignorance A working woman receives more respect in society than the housewife. 
However, a woman who is a believer is aware of this important truth. 
After all, such competition is meaningless. 
They base their friendships, and even their marriage, in this way. 
They nurture the relationships they think will bring them gain, and consider it a waste of time to maintain friendships with those who cannot be of any use to them. 
It would be impossible to convince them they were wrong about something. 
On the other hand, one may have great wealth, but he may use it to please Allah or to achieve some high purpose. 
On the Day of Judgment, he will not be asked how hard he worked to acquire his wealth, or how much he accumulated; he will be asked what he did for Allah to earn His favor. So, all the efforts he had put forth for worldly gain, will have been in vain. 
People whose efforts in the life of this world are misguided while they suppose that they are doing good." 
Every one of these charactertypes is influenced by the position he has been given, and determined by his responsibilities, salary and rank in relation to other workers. 
They do everything they can to get the boss to like them, and to get on his good side. 
They try to oppress those who work with them, with no regard for their moral qualities, because their criteria by which they judge others is not based on earning the pleasure of Allah. 
The reverse is also true; everyone behaves as best he can towards a superior, and is careful to do what is expected of him. 
A believer lives aware of this reality. 
As stated earlier, morality based on ignorance offers a totally different way of interpreting reality. 
In fact, this is often the case. 
In such a person, we can discern types of ignorant behavior such as lying, ignoring bad habits, being hypocritical and criticizing others behind their back. 
So, a person who is known as a doctor is regarded in society as intelligent, industrious and successful. 
In a society of ignorance it is accepted that those who have no money are always treated without respect and some doctors who work in hospitals are very good at treating such patients in this way. 
The patients that doctors have to deal with in hospitals are most often poor. 
Doctors work in a hospital more or less to earn their salary. 
However, no matter what one's profession may be, what will make a person honorable, respected and esteemed will be his efforts to win Allah's good pleasure, love and the infinite life in the Hereafter and his awareness of his weaknesses. 
In societies divorced from religion, most doctors are not aware of these realities because they are living under the strong influence of ideas instilled in their minds by the ignorant society they live in. 
Every deed done in accordance with the teaching of the Qur'an is directed towards winning Allah's approval and, no matter what their profession may be, believers exhibit high moral standards. 
It must first be made clear that there are many nurses who work devotedly day and night caring for their patients, despite their inadequate salary. 
However, we will discuss here those nurses who abide by the morality which is far removed from the true religion. 
They will behave towards others according to their station; for example, they show great respect towards the head nurse, but belittle other nurses. 
In the Qur'an, Allah tells us that no one other than He has the power to cause good or harm. 
For example, many merchants in such a society would not hesitate to sell damaged merchandise without properly informing the client. 
And, because their conscience does not bother them to do such a thing, they make it a regular mode of operation. 
Throughout the history of these societies of ignorance, there have been those who refuse to obey Allah's commands; they act unjustly and consistently cheat others. 
In compliance with the command of Allah, they always treat others justly, as they deserve to be treated, never infringing on their Godgiven rights. 
CHARACTER TYPES 
Because, the ignorant are very aware of the influence a specific environment can have on a person's character. 
They are used to getting everything easily, and so take the advantages of their material wealth for granted. 
And, as stated earlier, they fail to derive pleasure from good that is spiritual because they cannot recognize it. Compared to other charactertypes, their deviance is more blatant. 
Evidently, these people have developed for themselves a type of character contrary to the values otherwise considered acceptable. 
Moreover, one who appreciates the blessings that Allah has conferred upon him will have the breadth of insight to enable him to acknowledge the good in the others around him. 
He shows a deep sense of compassion and respect. 
Those called "nouveau riche" in a society of ignorance are usually people in the middle income bracket, who have become suddenly rich, either as the result of an inheritance or some other fortuitous cause. 
That is, they cannot see themselves through the eyes of others. 
They go out of their way to imitate what the wealthy are known to do. 
It is clear that it is Allah Who has provided their newfound wealth. 
However, they usually do not have any indepth knowledge in any such field. 
Allah encompasses the disbelievers. 
We have seen that those who live in a society of ignorance derive no enjoyment from their lives, professions or social status. 
Allah offers an example of their anxiety in the Qur'an: 
Are they the same? 
But, they will encounter disappointment in the next world. 
Another thing that must be remembered is this: One may dedicate his entire life to the pleasure of others, abandoning Allah; in the Afterlife, however, it is He Who will abandon them. 
The link between you is cut. Those you made such claims for have forsaken you. 
However, human beings must be satisfied with every moment Allah has created for them. 
Darwinism, in other words the theory of evolution, was put forward with the aim of denying the fact of creation, but is in truth nothing but failed, unscientific nonsense. 
Given the enormous importance of this subject, it will be of great benefit to summarize it here. 
The defeat of Darwinism in the face of science can be reviewed under three basic topics: 
Evolutionist followers of Oparin tried to carry out experiments to solve this problem. 
Natural selection holds that those living things that are stronger and more suited to the natural conditions of their habitats will survive in the struggle for life. 
Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book The Origin of Species, for instance, he said that some bears going into water to find food transformed themselves into whales over time.8 
The American geneticist B. G. Ranganathan explains this as follows: 
For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a random change in the framework of the building which, in all probability, would not be an improvement.9 
Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. 
Had this been the case, numerous intermediary species should have existed and lived within this long transformation period. 
For instance, some halffish/halfreptiles should have lived in the past which had acquired some reptilian traits in addition to the fish traits they already had. 
More importantly, the remains of these strange creatures should be present in the fossil record. 
If my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking most closely all of the species of the same group together must assuredly have existed... 
One famous British paleontologist, Derek V. Ager, admits this fact, even though he is an evolutionist: 
Fossils show that living beings emerged fully developed and in a perfect state on the Earth. 
This scheme is imaginary because it has never been proved that there is an evolutionary relation between these different classes. 
By outlining the link chain as Australopithecus > Homo habilis > Homo erectus > Homo sapiens, evolutionists imply that each of these species is one another's ancestor. 
However, recent findings of paleoanthropologists have revealed that Australopithecus, Homo habilis, and Homo erectus lived at different parts of the world at the same time.15 
What has become of our ladder if there are three coexisting lineages of hominids (A. africanus, the robust australopithecines, and H. habilis), none clearly derived from another? 
No matter what treatments it undergoes, this atomic heap cannot form even a single living being. 
Let these experts wait in turn beside these barrels for billions, and even trillions of years. 
The theory of evolution, which claims the opposite, is a total fallacy completely contrary to reason. 
Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 
Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the eye's retina. 
Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? 
The same situation applies to the ear. 
Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. 
However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this. 
The stimulations coming from a person's eyes, ears, and nose travel to the brain as electrochemical nerve impulses. 
For this consciousness is the spirit created by Allah, which needs neither the eye to watch the images nor the ear to hear the sounds. 
A wellknown geneticist and an outspoken evolutionist, Richard C. Lewontin from Harvard University, confesses that he is "first and foremost a materialist and then a scientist": 
Anyone free of prejudice and the influence of any particular ideology, who uses only his or her reason and logic, will clearly understand that belief in the theory of evolution, which brings to mind the superstitions of societies with no knowledge of science or civilization, is quite impossible. 
Even if We opened up to them a door into heaven, and they spent the day ascending through it, they would only say: "Our eyesight is befuddled! Or rather we have been put under a spell!" 
It is understandable that one or a few people might believe in impossible scenarios and claims full of stupidity and illogicality. 
The verses continue: 
And when they threw, they cast a spell on the people's eyes and caused them to feel great fear of them. They produced an extremely powerful magic. 
We revealed to Musa, "Throw down your staff." 
So on receiving the news of Ivan Ilych's death the first thought of each of the gentlemen in that private room was of the changes and promotions it might occasion among themselves or their acquaintances. 
I shall be sure to get Shtabel's place or Vinnikov's," thought Fedor Vasilievich. 
But what really was the matter with him?" The doctors couldn't sayat least they could, but each of them said something different. 
I think his wife had a littlebut something quiet trifling." 
Besides considerations as to the possible transfers and promotions likely to result from Ivan Ilych's death, the mere fact of the death of a near acquaintance aroused, as usual, in all who heard of it the complacent feeling that, "it is he who is dead and not I." 
The last time he had called on Ivan Ilych, Peter Ivanovich had seen Gerasim in the study. Ivan Ilych had been particularly fond of him and he was performing the duty of a sick nurse. 
He was much changed and grown even thinner since Peter Ivanovich had last seen him, but, as is always the case with the dead, his face was handsomer and above all more dignified than when he was alive. the expression on the face said that what was necessary had been accomplished, and accomplished rightly. 
This warning seemed to Peter Ivanovich out of place, or at least not applicable to him. 
Indeed he said this in a whisper as Peter Ivanovich passed him, proposing that they should meet for a game at Fedor Vasilievich's. 
But apparently Peter Ivanovich was not destined to play bridge that evening. 
Peter Ivanovich rose to detach it, and the springs of the pouffe, relieved of his weight, rose also and gave him a push. 
Sokolov then left the room. 
Then she sighed and evidently began to devise means of getting rid of her visitor. 
He bowed mournfully to them and was about to pass into the deathchamber, when from under the stairs appeared the figure of Ivan Ilych's schoolboy son, who was extremely like his father. 
He had been a member of the Court of Justice, and died at the age of fortyfive. 
Such was the Privy Councillor and superfluous member of various superfluous institutions, Ilya Epimovich Golovin. 
The eldest son was following in his father's footsteps only in another department, and was already approaching that stage in the service at which a similar sinecure would be reached. the third son was a failure. 
He had ruined his prospects in a number of positions and was not serving in the railway department. 
As examining magistrate Ivan Ilych was just as comme il faut and decorous a man, inspiring general respect and capable of separating his official duties from his private life, as he had been when acting as an official on special service. 
In his former position it had been pleasant to wear an undress uniform made by Scharmer, and to pass through the crowd of petitioners and officials who were timorously awaiting an audience with the governor, and who envied him as with free and easy gait he went straight into his chief's private room to have a cup of tea and a cigarette with him. 
At the same time, without at all altering the elegance of his toilet, he ceased shaving his chin and allowed his beard to grow as it pleased. 
While he had been an official on special service he had been accustomed to dance, but now as an examining magistrate it was exceptional for him to do so. 
If he danced now, he did it as if to show that though he served under the reformed order of things, and had reached the fifth official rank, yet when it came to dancing he could do it better than most people. 
In the country, without his work, he experienced ennui for the first time in his life, and not only ennui but intolerable depression, and he decided that it was impossible to go on living like that, and that it was necessary to take energetic measures. 
All he now wanted was an appointment to another post with a salary of five thousand rubles, either in the administration, in the banks, with the railways in one of the Empress Marya's Institutions, or even in the customsbut it had to carry with it a salary of five thousand rubles and be in a ministry other than that in which they had failed to appreciate him. 
He found a delightful house, just the thing both he and his wife had dreamt of. Spacious, lofty reception rooms in the old style, a convenient and dignified study, rooms for his wife and daughter, a study for his sonit might have been specially built for them. 
Looking at the yet unfinished drawing room he could see the fireplace, the screen, the whatnot, the little chairs dotted here and there, the dishes and plates on the walls, and the bronzes, as they would be when everything was in place. 
Tired, but with the feelings of a virtuosoone of the first violins who has played his part in an orchestra with precisionhe would return home to find that his wife and daughter had been out paying calls, or had a visitor, and that his son had been to school, had done his homework with his tutor, and was surely learning what is taught at High Schools. 
Praskovya Fedorovna had made her own plans, but Ivan Ilych insisted on getting everything from an expensive confectioner and ordered too many cakes, and the quarrel occurred because some of those cakes were left over and the confectioner's bill came to fortyfive rubles. 
He acknowledged that whatever disagreeable incident happened in his life, the pleasure that beamed like a ray of light above everything else was to sit down to bridge with good players, not noisy partners, and of course to fourhanded bridge (with five players it was annoying to have to stand out, though one pretended not to mind), to play a clever and serious game (when the cards allowed it) and then to have supper and drink a glass of wine. after a game of bridge, especially if he had won a little (to win a large sum was unpleasant), Ivan Ilych went to bed in a specially good humour. 
Sometimes he noticed that a plate or dish was chipped, or the food was not right, or his son put his elbow on the table, or his daughter's hair was not done as he liked it, and for all this he blamed Praskovya Fedorovna. 
It was not a question the doctor solved brilliantly, as it seemed to Ivan Ilych, in favour of the appendix, with the reservation that should an examination of the urine give fresh indications the matter would be reconsidered. 
I have already told you what I consider necessary and proper. 
She sat down reluctantly to listen to this tedious story, but could not stand it long, and her mother too did not hear him to the end. 
A friend of a friend of his, a very good doctor, diagnosed his illness again quite differently from the others, and though he predicted recovery, his questions and suppositions bewildered Ivan Ilych still more and increased his doubts. 
Those about him did not understand or would not understand it, but thought everything in the world was going on as usual. That tormented Ivan Ilych more than anything. 
One day he'll take his drops and keep strictly to his diet and go to bed in good time, but the next day unless I watch him he'll suddenly forget his medicine, eat sturgeonwhich is forbiddenand sit up playing cards till one o'clock in the morning." 
Be that as it may you'll never get well like that, but will always make us wretched." 
At the law courts too, Ivan Ilych noticed, or thought he noticed, a strange attitude towards himself. 
It sometimes seemed to him that people were watching him inquisitively as a man whose place might soon be vacant. 
"Does he think I am too weak to stretch out my arm?" thought Ivan Ilych, and forgetting what he was doing he overtrumped his partner, missing the grand slam by three tricks. 
V So one month passed and then another. 
Just before the New Year his brotherinlaw came to town and stayed at their house. 
His brotherinlaw opened his mouth to utter an exclamation of surprise but checked himself, and that action confirmed it all. 
No one knows. 
And Seshchetitsky [this was the celebrated specialist] said quite the contrary..." 
[That was the friend whose friend was a doctor.] 
He rang, ordered the carriage, and got ready to go. 
He got home rather late for dinner, ate his dinner, and conversed cheerfully, but could not for a long time bring himself to go back to work in his room. 
But he did not give himself up to it, and went to the drawingroom for tea. 
Since his illness he had slept alone in a small room next to his study. 
"I need only take it regularly and avoid all injurious influences. 
He jumped up and tried to light the candle, felt for it with trembling hands, dropped candle and candlestick on the floor, and fell back on his pillow. 
And he again began thinking. 
"Yes, the beginning of my illness: I knocked my side, but I was still quite well that day and the next. 
She won't understand," he thought.) 
While she was kissing him he hated her from the bottom of his soul and with difficulty refrained from pushing her away. 
He could not understand it, and tried to drive this false, incorrect, morbid thought away and to replace it by other proper and healthy thoughts. 
But that thought, and not the thought only but the reality itself, seemed to come and confront him. 
And to save himself from this condition Ivan Ilych looked for consolationsnew screensand new screens were found and for a while seemed to save him, but then they immediately fell to pieces or rather became transparent, as if It penetrated them and nothing could veil It. 
Gerasim was a clean, fresh peasant lad, grown stout on town food and always cheerful and bright. 
Oh, why, sir," and Gerasim's eyes beamed and he showed his glistening white teeth, "what's a little trouble? 
Ivan Ilych was still sitting in the same position in the armchair. 
Gerasim," he said when the latter had replaced the freshlywashed utensil. 
"Please come here and help me." 
Only Gerasim recognized it and pitied him. 
Perhaps it may still do some good." 
He took a spoonful and swallowed it. 
If it would only cease just for a moment!" 
And he moaned. 
Peter turned towards him. 
I will tell him, the doctor, that he must think of something else. 
Ivan Ilych feels that the doctor would like to say: "Well, how are our affairs?" but that even he feels that this would not do, and says instead: "What sort of a night have you had?" 
These sick people do have foolish fancies of that kind, but we must forgive them." 
I am doing this for my own sake," she said ironically, letting it be felt that she was doing it all for his sake and only said this to leave him no right to refuse. 
Everything she did for him was entirely for her own sake, and she told him she was doing for herself what she actually was doing for herself, as if that was so incredible that he must understand the opposite. 
Again the sounding began and the significant conversations in his presence and in another room, about the kidneys and the appendix, and the questions and answers, with such an air of importance that again, instead of the real question of life and death which now alone confronted him, the question arose of the kidney and appendix which were not behaving as they ought to and would now be attached by Michael Danilovich and the specialist and forced to amend their ways. 
And the inevitable end of it all became more and more terrible. 
IX His wife returned late at night. 
Are you in great pain?" 
Then what does it mean? 
"But how could that be, when I did everything properly?" he replied, and immediately dismissed from his mind this, the sole solution of all the riddles of life and death, as something quite impossible. 
Ivan Ilych now no longer left his sofa. 
Now before his eyes there was only a kidney or an intestine that temporarily evaded its duty, and now only that incomprehensible and dreadful death from which it was impossible to escape. 
There had been more of what was good in life and more of life itself. 
But it is impossible to say that," and he remembered all the legality, correctitude, and propriety of his life. 
You can't even do that. 
The doctor went into the drawing room and told Praskovya Fedorovna that the case was very serious and that the only resource left was opium to allay her husband's sufferings, which must be terrible. 
He tried to defend all those things to himself and suddenly felt the weakness of what he was defending. 
He groaned and tossed about, and pulled at his clothing which choked and stifled him. And he hated them on that account. 
What had happened to him was like the sensation one sometimes experiences in a railway carriage when one thinks one is going backwards while one is really going forwards and suddenly becomes aware of the real direction. 
He wished to say this but had not the strength to utter it. 
Yes, here it is. 
There was no fear because there was no death. 
Within these houses there is, perhaps, the silence of the cloister, the barrenness of moors, the skeleton of ruins; life and movement are so stagnant there that a stranger might think them uninhabited, were it not that he encounters suddenly the pale, cold glance of a motionless person, whose halfmonastic face peers beyond the windowcasing at the sound of an unaccustomed step. 
This wall serves as a counter for the merchandise. 
A housewife cannot buy a partridge without the neighbors asking the husband if it were cooked to a turn. 
Napoleon, however, did not like republicans, and superseded Monsieur Grandet (who was supposed to have worn the Phrygian cap) by a man of his own surroundings, a future baron of the Empire. 
He had constructed in the interests of the town certain fine roads which led to his own property; his house and lands, very advantageously assessed, paid moderate taxes; and since the registration of his various estates, the vineyards, thanks to his constant care, had become the "head of the country,"a local term used to denote those that produced the finest quality of wine. 
Monsieur Grandet was then fiftyseven years of age, his wife thirtysix, and an only daughter, the fruit of their legitimate love, was ten years old. 
He could crouch and lie low, watch his prey a long while, spring upon it, open his jaws, swallow a mass of louis, and then rest tranquilly like a snake in process of digestion, impassible, methodical, and cold. 
So that when, after a game of boston or an evening discussion on the matter of vines, the talk fell upon Monsieur Grandet, knowing people said: "Le Pere Grandet? le Pere Grandet must have at least five or six millions." 
His farmers supplied him weekly with a sufficiency of capons, chickens, eggs, butter, and his tithe of wheat. He owned a mill; and the tenant was bound, over and above his rent, to take a certain quantity of grain and return him the flour and bran. 
His firewood was cut from his own hedgerows or taken from the halfrotten old sheds which he built at the corners of his fields, and whose planks the farmers carted into town for him, all cut up, and obligingly stacked in his woodhouse, receiving in return his thanks. 
This secret warfare between the Cruchots and des Grassins, the prize thereof being the hand in marriage of Eugenie Grandet, kept the various social circles of Saumur in violent agitation. 
At the beginning of 1811, the Cruchotines won a signal advantage over the Grassinists. 
Gray panels with ancient mouldings covered the walls from top to bottom; the ceiling showed all its beams, which were likewise painted gray, while the space between them had been washed over in white, now yellow with age. 
Though she received only sixty francs a year in wages, she was supposed to be one of the richest servingwomen in Saumur. 
Le Pere Grandet was at that time thinking of marriage and about to set up his household. 
Neither the warts which adorned her martial visage, nor the redbrick tints of her skin, nor the sinewy arms, nor the ragged garments of la Grande Nanon, dismayed the cooper, who was at that time still of an age when the heart shudders. 
One tallow candle sufficed the family for the evening. 
The autumn had been very fine. 
In Berry and in Anjou, when a young girl marries, her family, or that of the husband, must give her a purse, in which they place, according to their means, twelve pieces, or twelve dozen pieces, or twelve hundred pieces of gold. 
She had big bones, a big nose, a big forehead, big eyes, and presented at first sight a vague resemblance to those mealy fruits that have neither savor nor succulence. 
The four or five louis presented by the Belgian or the Dutchman who purchased the wine were the chief visible signs of Madame Grandet's annual revenues. 
Nanon opened the door, and the light from the hearth, reflected on the ceiling, enabled the three Cruchots to find their way into the room. 
"Excuse me, messieurs," cried Grandet, recognizing their voices; "I'll be with you in a moment. 
The abbe kissed Eugenie's hand. As for Maitre Cruchot, he boldly kissed her on both cheeks, remarking: "How we sprout up, to be sure! 
"I think so," answered Madame Grandet. 
They are descended from Adam, and so are you." 
"Yes, but let us mind what we are about," said Grandet in a tone which made the president tremble. 
"Is he driving some bargain?" thought Cruchot. 
She dressed well, got her fashions from Paris, set the tone to Saumur, and gave parties. 
Her husband, formerly a quartermaster in the Imperial guard, who had been desperately wounded at Austerlitz, and had since retired, still retained, in spite of his respect for Grandet, the seeming frankness of an old soldier. 
She turned her eyes to her father as if to ask permission to accept it, and Monsieur Grandet replied: "Take it, my daughter," in a tone which would have made an actor illustrious. 
"I give her something better than scissors," answered Grandet. 
"Couldn't he have found some little trifle which cost money?" 
"We will join you at cards, Madame Grandet," said Madame des Grassins. 
At halfpast eight in the evening the two cardtables were set out. 
The old cooper, with inward selfconceit, was contemplating the pink feathers and the fresh toilet of Madame des Grassins, the martial head of the banker, the faces of Adolphe, the president, the abbe, and the notary, saying to himself:"They are all after my money. 
Hey! neither the one nor the other shall have my daughter; but they are usefuluseful as harpoons to fish with." 
This family gaiety in the old gray room dimly lighted by two tallow candles; this laughter, accompanied by the whirr of Nanon's spinningwheel, sincere only upon the lips of Eugenie or her mother; this triviality mingled with important interests; this young girl, who, like certain birds made victims of the price put upon them, was now lured and trapped by proofs of friendship of which she was the dupe,all these things contributed to make the scene a melancholy comedy. Is it not, moreover, a drama of all times and all places, though here brought down to its simplest expression? 
The tender sentiments of life hold here but a secondary place; only the three pure, simple hearts of Nanon, of Eugenie, and of her mother were inspired by them. 
Eugenie and her mother knew nothing of Grandet's wealth; they could only estimate the things of life by the glimmer of their pale ideas, and they neither valued nor despised money, because they were accustomed to do without it. 
"He must have come from Paris." 
"I know from Monsieur Grandet's tone of voice that he is annoyed; perhaps he would not like to find us talking of his affairs." 
"Do not let me interrupt you, I beg; go on with your game: it is too amusing to leave." 
"Mark it down, Madame des Grassins. 
Isn't that your number?" 
The enormous quantity of linen which allowed these people to have their clothing washed only once in six months, and to keep it during that time in the depths of their closets, also enabled time to lay its grimy and decaying stains upon it. 
As for the others, the general negligence of their dress, which was incomplete and wanting in freshness,like the toilet of all country places, where insensibly people cease to dress for others and come to think seriously of the price of a pair of gloves,was in keeping with the negligence of the Cruchots. 
Eugenie, prompted by a thought often born in the heart of a young girl when sentiment enters it for the first time, left the room to go and help her mother and Nanon. 
She herself covered the old table with a cloth and requested Nanon to change it every morning; she convinced her mother that it was necessary to light a good fire, and persuaded Nanon to bring up a great pile of wood into the corridor without saying anything to her father. 
But if we do not frighten you away, you will find there are some amusements even here." 
"Ah! what do you mean by that, monsieur l'abbe?" demanded Monsieur des Grassins. 
"I mean it in the best possible sense for you, for madame, for the town of Saumur, and for monsieur," said the wily old man, turning to Charles. 
In the position I now hold I cannot survive the disgrace of bankruptcy. 
I have the bitterness of owing nearly four millions, with assets not more than twentyfive per cent in value to pay them. The wines in my warehouses suffer from the fall in prices caused by the abundance and quality of your vintage. 
"We do not wish to intrude, Grandet," said the banker; "you may want to talk to your nephew, and therefore we will bid you goodnight." 
"No, monsieur l'abbe; I meant to say the _Liaisons dangereuses_." 
If this young manwho I admit is very goodlookingwere to make love to me, he would not think of his cousin. 
"But in that case the cousin wouldn't have fallen among us like a cannonball," answered the notary. 
You may perhaps hear people say that I am rich,Monsieur Grandet this, Monsieur Grandet that. 
Charles took a lighted wax candle from Nanon's hand,an Anjou candle, very yellow in color, and so shopworn that it looked like tallow and deceived Monsieur Grandet, who, incapable of suspecting its presence under his roof, did not perceive this magnificence. 
Nanon went to bolt the outer door; then she closed the hall and let loose a wolfdog, whose bark was so strangled that he seemed to have laryngitis. 
When Charles saw the yellow, smokestained walls of the well of the staircase, where each wormeaten step shook under the heavy footfall of his uncle, his expectations began to sober more and more. 
He alone had the key of this laboratory, whereso people declaredhe studied the maps on which his fruittrees were marked, and calculated his profits to a vine, and almost to a twig. 
Madame Grandet had a room next to that of Eugenie, which was entered through a glass door. 
The master's chamber was separated from that of his wife by a partition, and from the mysterious strongroom by a thick wall. 
"But, monsieur, the sheets are damp, and this gentleman is as delicate as a woman." 
Grandet gazed at the door lined with sheetiron which he lately put to his sanctum, and said to himself,"What a crazy idea of my brother to bequeath his son to me! 
I have not fifty francs to give him. 
She laced her corset straight, without skipping a single eyelet. 
The pavement of the courtyard showed the black stains produced in time by lichens, herbage, and the absence of all movement or friction. 
Three parallel walks, gravelled and separated from each other by square beds, where the earth was held in by boxborders, made the garden, which terminated, beneath a terrace of the old walls, in a group of lindens. 
A thousand confused thoughts came to birth in her mind and grew there, as the sunbeams grew without along the wall. 
"He is not up," she thought, hearing Nanon's morning cough as the good soul went and came, sweeping out the halls, lighting her fire, chaining the dog, and speaking to the beasts in the stable. 
"Nanon, please make us a _galette_." 
"Mustn't rob the master to feast the cousin. You ask him for butter and flour and wood: he's your father, perhaps he'll give you some. 
I have never seen you like this before. What have you got in your head? 
You sha'n't have more than six pieces of sugar." 
In spite of the recent fall in prices, sugar was still in Grandet's eyes the most valuable of all the colonial products; to him it was always six francs a pound. 
He opened the cupboard where the flour was kept, gave her a cupful, and added a few ounces of butter to the piece he had already cut off. 
"What luck you have had! 
"True enough; poplars should only be planted on poor soil," said Cruchot, amazed at Grandet's calculations. 
Of what crime had Charles been guilty? 
"Monsieur Grandet, one of the most respected merchants in Paris, blew his brains out yesterday, after making his usual appearance at the Bourse. 
The esteem felt for Monsieur Grandet and the credit he enjoyed were nevertheless such that he might have obtained the necessary assistance from other business houses. It is much to be regretted that so honorable a man should have yielded to momentary despair," etc. 
"But, monsieur," said Nanon, "who wouldn't feel pity for the poor young man, sleeping there like a wooden shoe, without knowing what's coming?" 
She did not answer. 
Madame Grandet, seeing that she turned pale, opened the window and let her breathe fresh air. 
In truth the life of the Hungarian sisters, bound together by a freak of nature, could scarcely have been more intimate than that of Eugenie and her mother,always together in the embrasure of that window, and sleeping together in the same atmosphere. 
At these words the young girl raised her head, questioned her mother by a look, and seemed to search out her inmost thought. 
"If he is unhappy, ought he not to stay with us? 
"Yes, my child, it seems natural; but your father has his reasons: we must respect them." 
Eugenie called Nanon. 
Nanon came back with two fresh eggs. 
Eugenie could not repress a tear. 
The true Parisian! he had put as much dandyism into his dress as if he were in the chateau of the noble lady then travelling in Scotland. 
"You must be hungry, cousin," said Eugenie; "will you take your seat?" 
Besides" here he pulled out the prettiest watch Breguet ever made. 
Well, I shall be glad to have anything to eat,anything, it doesn't matter what, a chicken, a partridge." 
"Oh! fresh eggs," said Charles, who, like all people accustomed to luxury, had already forgotten about his partridge, "that is delicious: now, if you will give me the butter, my good girl." 
"Nanon, bring the butter," cried Eugenie. 
He perceived, as his eyes lingered upon her, the exquisite harmony of features in the pure face, the grace of her innocent attitude, the magic clearness of the eyes, where young love sparkled and desire shone unconsciously. 
"No, I really have not enough mind to make fun of others; and doubtless it is a great defect. 
"Nanon fetched it from Fessard's; there was none." 
"My nephew, who knows by what afflictions God is pleased to try us?" said his aunt. 
Eugenie, her mother, and Nanon went into the kitchen, moved by irresistible curiosity to watch the two actors in the scene which was about to take place in the garden, where at first the uncle walked silently ahead of the nephew. 
"You have lost your father," seemed to him a mere nothing to say; fathers die before their children. 
I can get a carriage somewhere?" he added, turning to his uncle, who stood motionless. 
But that's nothing; there is something worse: he blew out his brains." 
He'll be all right if he weeps,That is not the worst, my poor nephew," he said aloud, not noticing whether Charles heard him, "that is nothing; you will get over it: but" "Never, never! 
"But that young man is good for nothing; his head is more taken up with the dead than with his money." 
"To fail, Eugenie," he resumed, "is to commit a theft which the law, unfortunately, takes under its protection. 
"Ah! if you did but know what my father said to Monsieur Cruchot." 
"We will pray for him," said Madame Grandet. 
"Cousin," said Eugenie, "take courage! 
He uttered a heartrending cry, and hid his face in his hands. 
My God! my God! forgive my father, for he must have suffered sorely!" 
Eugenie had seen in the furtive glance that she cast about the young man's roomthat girlish glance which sees all in the twinkling of an eyethe pretty trifles of his dressingcase, his scissors, his razors embossed with gold. 
"Wife," he said, without stuttering, "I've trapped them all! 
That Belgian fellowyou know who I meancame up to me. 
In three months wines will have fallen." 
"Yes, little one." 
Where is that fellow, has he come down yet?" 
The thinning out of his two thousand acres of forest land had yielded him six hundred thousand francs: putting this sum to that derived from the sale of his poplars and to his other gains for the last year and for the current year, he had amassed a total of nine hundred thousand francs, without counting the two hundred thousand he had got by the sale just concluded. 
In two years I shall have fifteen hundred thousand francs, which I will then draw out in good gold,Well, where's my nephew?" 
Hunger drives the wolves out of the woods." 
Give me a hatband; that's enough for me." 
"Nothing should be wasted," answered Grandet, rousing himself from his reverie. 
I will bid my nephew goodnight for the rest of you, and see if he will take anything." 
Yes, weep, that's natural. 
Hearing these words, mother and daughter slipped back into their rooms and burrowed in their beds, with the celerity of frightened mice getting back to their holes. 
This thought casts a terrible light upon our present epoch, in which, far more than at any former period, money sways the laws and politics and morals. 
Once enlightened, virtue makes her calculations as well as vice. 
Are there not thoughts and actions in the life of love which to certain souls bear the full meaning of the holiest espousals? 
This lamb it is which the miser fattens, puts in his fold, slaughters, cooks, eats, and then despises. 
He had hatched a plot by which to trick the Parisians, to decoy and dupe and snare them, to drive them into a trap, and make them go and come and sweat and hope and turn pale,a plot by which to amuse himself, the old provincial cooper, sitting there beneath his gloomy rafters, or passing up and down the rotten staircase of his house in Saumur. 
She ran to the kitchen with the swiftness and lightness of a bird. 
"Nanon, go and do his room!" 
That staircase, so often traversed, which echoed to the slightest noise, now lost its decaying aspect in the eyes of Eugenie. 
His saddened heart felt the sweetness of the gentle friendship, the exquisite sympathy which these two souls, crushed under perpetual restraint, knew so well how to display when, for an instant, they were left unfettered in the regions of suffering, their natural sphere. 
When she looked again towards her cousin she was still blushing, but her looks could at least deceive, and did not betray the excess of joy which innundated her heart; yet the eyes of both expressed the same sentiment as their souls flowed together in one thought,the future was theirs. 
"Here, Cornoiller," she said, slipping ten francs into the man's hand, "some day we will reward your services." 
"Have a good dinner, Nanon; my cousin will come down," said Eugenie. 
Yet it is perhaps equally certain that outside of Saumur the goodman would have cut a very sorry figure. 
"When a man so respected and important as, for example, your late brother" "Mmy bbbrother, yes." "is threatened with insolvency" "They cccall it ininsssolvency?" 
"Ttthat's very dddifferent, if it dddoesn't cccost mmmore," said Grandet. 
Mmmy vines, my dddrainsin short, I've my own bbbusiness. 
Grandet made an eartrumpet of his hand, and the president repeated his words. 
I lllive here and lllook after the vvvines. 
Grandet is a gggood uncle; he mmmeans well. 
Ha! ha! you can coax a dog a long way if you show him a bit of lard. 
Right, very right, Grandet. 
"Ththen sssublime ththings cccost ddear," answered the goodman, as the banker warmly wrung his hand. 
"But this, my dear Grandet,if the president will excuse me,is a purely commercial matter, and needs a consummate business man. 
The two parties stayed on for a short time. 
Des Grassins said, after a pause, striking Grandet on the shoulder,"It is a good thing to have a relation like him." 
"Farewell for the present!" said Madame des Grassins. 
At eleven o'clock Cornoiller will be at the door with the chariot from Froidfond. 
It must be Charles, she thought; he was so pale, so full of despair when she had seen him last,could he have killed himself? 
Suddenly her eye encountered that of her father; and his glance, vague and unnoticing as it was, terrified her. 
"What a pity that it is only copper sous!" answered Grandet. 
Is the carriage strong?" 
Nanon bolted the great door, let loose the dog, and went off to bed with a bruised shoulder, no one in the neighborhood suspecting either the departure of Grandet or the object of his journey. 
"He has been settling all his affairs, so as to leave France at once," she thought. 
He loves! he is loved! 
"I am doing wrong; but I must read it, that letter," she said. 
Alas! my beloved, I have no money with which to go to you, to give and receive a last kiss from which I might derive some strength for my forlorn enterprise. 
"Poor Charles! I did well to read the letter. 
I have never thought of the miseries of poverty. 
How was it possible that an innocent girl should perceive the coldheartedness evinced by this letter? 
Do you know what Madame Campan used to tell us?'My dears, as long as a man is a minister, adore him; when he falls, help to drag him in the gutter. 
Item, five _genovines_, or five hundredfranc pieces of Genoa; another very rare coin worth eightyseven francs on exchange, but a hundred francs to collectors. 
"I have read those letters." 
See," she said, opening her purse, "here are the savings of a poor girl who wants nothing. 
"There," he continued, "is something as precious to me as life itself. 
Never did friend commit anything more sacred to another. 
"What is Froidfond worth?" "I don't know; but he has Noyers." 
"Thank him better than that, nephew. 
"What!" exclaimed his uncle, with wellacted pride, "are you not my nephew? 
Is not your name Grandet?" 
The old cooper accompanied the banker to the front door. Then, after closing it, he came back and plunged into his armchair, saying to Nanon,"Get me some blackcurrant ratafia." 
Too excited, however, to remain long in one place, he got up, looked at the portrait of Monsieur de la Bertelliere, and began to sing, doing what Nanon called his dancing steps,"Dans les gardes francaises J'avais un bon papa." 
However, during the two hours consecrated to digestion, the cooper, more facetious than he had ever been in his life, uttered a number of his own particular apothegms,a single one of which will give the measure of his mind. 
Let me see, wife, what have you got?" he added, turning eagerly to her. 
"Well, cousin, are you satisfied with the management of your affairs?" said Eugenie in a low voice. 
My outfit and ten thousand francs, which two of my friends send me, are a very small beginning. 
"Oh, yes! indeed, yes!" he answered, with a depth of tone that revealed an equal depth of feeling. 
When she saw him, she retreated to the foot of the staircase and opened the swingdoor; then, scarcely knowing where she was going, Eugenie reached the corner near Nanon's den, in the darkest end of the passage. 
"So be it!" cried Nanon, opening the door of her lair. 
At last the eve of his departure came. 
"Nephew," said Grandet, in the doorway of the inn from which the coach started, kissing Charles on both cheeks, "depart poor, return rich; you will find the honor of your father safe. 
When these praises had circulated for a certain length of time, the creditors asked for the rest of their money. 
In answer to the proposals contained in the letter, Grandet of Saumur demanded that all vouchers for claims against the estate of his brother should be deposited with a notary, together with aquittances for the fortyseven per cent already paid; he made this demand under pretence of sifting the accounts and finding out the exact condition of the estate. 
It roused at once a variety of difficulties. 
Generally speaking, the creditor is a species of maniac, ready to agree to anything one day, on the next breathing fire and slaughter; later on, he grows amicable and easygoing. 
Grandet had studied the atmospheric variations of creditors, and the creditors of his brother justified all his calculations. 
The old cooper had calculated on the power of time, which, as he used to say, is a pretty good devil after all. 
Grandet answered that the notary and the broker whose shameful failures had caused the death of his brother were still living, that they might now have recovered their credit, and that they ought to be sued, so as to get something out of them towards lessening the total of the deficit. 
"I am very sorry for you, for you are a good little woman." 
Nanon had brought herself to see that she could pity the sufferings of her young mistress without failing in her duty to the old master, and she would say to Eugenie,"If I had a man for myself I'dI'd follow him to hell, yes, I'd exterminate myself for him; but I've none. 
Well, mamz'elle, it pleases me, but it isn't love." 
"I'm always gay,"Gai, gai, gai, le tonnelier, Raccommodez votre cuvier!" he answered, entering his wife's room fully dressed. 
There'll be a double napoleon for Eugenie in the package," he whispered in Madame Grandet's ear. 
Nanon shall take back your barrow. 
We may have time to replace the treasure before your feteday." 
On my word of honor, it's all the gold I have; you are the only one that has got any gold. 
"Clear away," said Grandet to Nanon when, about eleven o'clock, breakfast was over, "but leave the table. 
I'll give you in return six thousand francs in _livres_, and you are to put them just where I tell you. 
When I marry you (which will be soon) I shall get you a husband who can give you the finest 'dozen' ever seen in the provinces. 
Yes, silver and gold live and swarm like men; they come, and go, and sweat, and multiply" Eugenie rose; but after making a few steps towards the door she turned abruptly, looked her father in the face, and said,"I have not got _my_ gold." 
"Monsieur," said the daughter, falling at Madame Grandet's knees, "my mother is ill. 
Eugenie made a negative motion with her head. 
She grew as crafty through love as her father was through avarice, and reiterated the negative sign. 
But give their gold!for you have given it to some one, hein?" 
You hear mego!" 
Eugenie rose, looked proudly at her father, and withdrew to her room. Grandet turned the key of the door. 
If you want peace in this household, make your daughter confess, pump it out of her. 
Women understand how to do that better than we do. 
That money belonged to her; she is incapable of making any but a good use of it, and God alone has the right to know our good deeds. 
Monsieur, I implore you, take Eugenie back into favor; forgive her. 
He has got neither heart nor soul if he dared to carry off a young girl's treasure without the consent of her parents." 
"So you're a widower, monsieur," said Nanon; "it must be disagreeable to be a widower with two women in the house." 
You sha'n't live on dry bread, I'm determined; it isn't wholesome." 
There came a moment when all pretexts failed to explain her perpetual absence. 
It was even known that the young woman was not able to see or take care of her mother, except at certain times when her father was out of the house. 
Why, that constitutes wrongful cruelty; she can contest, as much in as upon" "Come, nephew, spare us your legal jargon," said the notary. 
"Set your mind at ease, madame; I will put a stop to such treatment tomorrow." 
"Well, my daughter, let Monsieur Cruchot manage the matter if he is so sure of success. 
After all, you can't wish to kill your wife; her life is too important to you. 
Swear to me upon your honor that all you've told me is legally true. 
"What's this?" he said, snatching the treasure and carrying it to the window. 
Grandet took his knife to pry out some of the gold; to do this, he placed the dressingcase on a chair. 
It is a trust placed in my hands by an unhappy relation: I must give it back to him uninjured!" 
Madame Grandet fainted. 
"Take back your money, father; we ask for nothing but your affection." 
She could not see the window and the chair on its castors without weeping. 
"Mademoiselle," said the notary, "it is my duty to point out to you that you are despoiling yourself without guarantee" "Good heavens! what is all that to me?" 
After her father's death Eugenie learned from Maitre Cruchot that she possessed an income of three hundred thousand francs from landed and personal property in the arrondissement of Saumur; also six millions invested at three per cent in the Funds (bought at sixty, and now worth seventysix francs); also two millions in gold coin, and a hundred thousand francs in silver crownpieces, besides all the interest which was still to be collected. 
The day on which Maitre Cruchot handed in to his client a clear and exact schedule of the whole inheritance, Eugenie remained alone with Nanon, sitting beside the fireplace in the vacant hall, where all was now a memory, from the chair on castors which her mother had sat in, to the glass from which her cousin drank. 
"Nanon, we are alone" "Yes, mademoiselle; and if I knew where he was, the darling, I'd go on foot to find him." 
Cornoiller, amazed at such magnificence, spoke of his mistress with tears in his eyes; he would willingly have been hacked in pieces in her behalf. 
She took charge of the weekly accounts; she locked up the provisions and gave them out daily, after the manner of her defunct master; she ruled over two servants,a cook, and a maid whose business it was to mend the houselinen and make mademoiselle's dresses. Cornoiller combined the functions of keeper and bailiff. 
Thus her upward spring towards happiness had wasted her strength and given her nothing in exchange for it. 
In the life of the soul, as in the physical life, there is an inspiration and a respiration; the soul needs to absorb the sentiments of another soul and assimilate them, that it may render them back enriched. 
By degrees she grew accustomed to be treated as a sovereign and to see her court pressing around her every evening. 
One or another would remark that in seven years he had largely increased his fortune, that Bonfons brought in at least ten thousand francs a year, and was surrounded, like the other possessions of the Cruchots, by the vast domains of the heiress. 
Early in the spring, Madame des Grassins attempted to trouble the peace of the Cruchotines by talking to Eugenie of the Marquis de Froidfond, whose ancient and ruined family might be restored if the heiress would give him back his estates through marriage. 
"Though Monsieur de Froidfond is fifty," she said, "he does not look older than Monsieur Cruchot. He is a widower, and he has children, that's true. 
Nanon," said Eugenie, one night as she was going to bed, "how is it that in seven years he has never once written to me?" 
The mother told him how delighted she would be to give up the groundfloor to a soninlaw. 
His complexion had bronzed, his manners had grown decided and bold, like those of a man accustomed to make sharp decisions, to rule, and to succeed. Charles breathed more at his ease in Paris, conscious that he now had a part to play. 
I have not earned two millions by the sweat of my brow to fling them at the head of my father's creditors." 
The words rang as loudly in the heart of Eugenie as they echoed in sound from wall to wall of the court and garden. 
Such was Eugenie's love after she had read that dreadful letter. 
At this moment Madame des Grassins was announced. 
Eugenie read the following letter:My dear Wife,Charles Grandet has returned from the Indies and has been in Paris about a month"A month!" thought Eugenie, her hand falling to her side. 
I went to tell Grandet of the steps his uncle and I took in his father's business, and the clever manoeuvres by which we had managed to keep the creditor's quiet until the present time. 
The insolent fellow had the face to say to meto me, who for five years have devoted myself night and day to his interests and his honor!that _his father's affairs were not his_! 
She hid her misery behind a veil of courtesy. 
"Go to Paris,not tomorrow, but instantly. 
Yes, my cousin, you judged rightly of my mind and of my manners. 
The president smiled at the exclamation which the ambitious young man could not repress as he received the documents. "We shall announce our marriages at the same time," remarked Monsieur de Bonfons. 
The president was out of hearing. 
Three days later Monsieur de Bonfons, on his return to Saumur, announced his marriage with Eugenie. 
He hankered after a peerage; and then"The king will be his cousin, won't he?" said Nanon, la Grande Nanon, Madame Cornoiller, bourgeoise of Saumur, as she listened to her mistress, who was recounting the honors to which she was called. 
If it is the result of mere caprice, it is unpardonable. 
﻿Yes, Marlin. l see it. lt's beautiful. 
Coral, get inside the house. 
Don't move. 
And here and here. 
First, we check to see that the coast is clear. 
Then we go out and back in. 
All right. Come on, boy. 
Sandy Plankton from next door said that sea turtles live to be about 1 00 years old. lf l ever meet a sea turtle, l'll ask himafter l'm done talking to the shark. 
Hey, you're a clownfish. 
There's a mollusc. 
Be nice. lt's his first time at school. 
There you are! 
Daddy, help me! l'm coming, Nemo. 
At least l think it does. 
Something's wrong with you. 
You wouldn't want one of them to pop. 
Finally. 
Look, l'm a flipping little dolphin. 
Ain't l something? Today's meeting is step five: Bring a Fish Friend. 
Just start with your name. 
My name is Marlin. l'm a clownfish. 
A clownfish? 
Normally they don't talk, but in a joke, everyone talks. 
Probably American. 
You really clocked me there. 
Just a bite. 
Help me find a way out. 
He never even knew his father. 
Sorry about... 
There's nothing to worry about. 
He is clean. 
That's a KFlex. lt's got a teardrop cross section. 
Go ahead and rinse. 
Fish got to swim. 
They're my fish. 
He's stuck. 
Can you help me? 
From the ocean. 
Yeah. l've seen that look before. 
So, kid, you got a name or what? 
Come on. 
What are you doing? l've lost the mask. 
Who could it be? lt's me. 
Mr Bossy. 
P Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. l remembered what it said. l forget things, but l remembered it. 
Newcomer of orange and white. 
Welcome, brother Sharkbait. 
Darla's coming in five days. 
Where are you going? 
Why do l have to tell you again? l don't get tired of it. 
Ted here's got relatives in Sydney. 
Then you got to follow that for about... what do you guys think? 
That baby's going to float you right past Sydney. 
Through it. 
Bad trench. 
Boy, it sure is clear up here. 
Exactly. 
Come here, little Squishy. 
You can't catch me. 
They will... not sting you. 
You're doing fine. 
And then we were all, like, whoa! 
Really? 
Grab what? 
Well, okay. l live on this reef, a long way from here. 
This is going to be good. l can tell. 
He scares them away by blowing them up. 
The only thing they can see down there is... 
He has to blast his way... 
He was taken off the reef by divers... 
There. Take it. 
Nothing should be worth that. l'm sorry l couldn't get you back to your father, kid. 
Some sort of sport fish. 
He's giving it all he's got and then three sharks capture him and he blows them up and dives thousands of feet and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth! 
Now he's with sea turtles on the East Australian Current and the word is he's headed this way, right now, to Sydney! 
He was looking for you after all. 
Where? l don't see it. 
Squirt here will now give you a rundown on proper exiting technique. 
Good afternoon. We're going to have a great jump today. 
How old are you? 1 50, dude! 
We going in there? 
Just keep swimming Boy, this is taking a while. 
We'll figure it out up there. 
Let's play the ''let's not die'' card. 
Nemo...was taken to... 
See, he's swimming away. 
Move, Dory! 
Cos you had to ask for help. 
And now we're stuck here. 
No. l promised him l'd never let anything happen to him. 
That's a funny thing to promise. 
No, you can't. 
We can do this! 
Boss must have installed it while we were sleeping. 
Would you look at that? 
No. l know your son. 
Nobody's going to hurt you. 
Ring of Fire! 
He did it! l'm happy. ls he going to be okay? 
You're not dead. 
Swim down together. 
That's it! lt's working! 
Daddy's here. 
Who is this Sandy Plankton that knows everything wrong? 
Where'd the fish go? 
But then again there arose strong and great winds from the south, with a point east, which carried us up (for all that we could do) towards the north; by which time our victuals failed us, though we had made good spare of them. 
And above all, the sign of the cross to that instrument was to us a great rejoicing, and as it were a certain presage of good. 
About three hours after we had dispatched our answer, there came towards us a person (as it seemed) of place. 
For,” said he, “if you will follow my advice, there shall first go with me some few of you, and see the place, and how it may be made convenient for you; and then you may send for your sick, and the rest of your number, which you will bring on land.” 
Besides, there were brought in to us, great store of those scarlet oranges, for our sick; which (they said) were an assured remedy for sickness taken at sea. 
For the commandment laid upon us, we would not fail to obey it, though it was impossible but our hearts should be enflamed to tread further upon this happy and holy ground.” 
We answered; “That we humbly thanked him that he would give us leave so to do: and that we conceived by the taste we had already, that there was no worldly thing on earth, more worthy to be known than the state of that happy land. 
It was answered by us all, in all possible humbleness, but yet with a countenance taking knowledge, that we knew that he spake it but merrily, “That we were apt enough to think there was somewhat supernatural in this island; but yet rather as angelical than magical. 
But to let his lordship know truly what it was that made us tender and doubtful to ask this question, it was not any such conceit,” but because we remembered, he had given a touch in his former speech, that this land had laws of secrecy touching strangers.” 
For the king of this island, (by name Altabin,) a wise man and a great warrior, knowing well both his own strength and that of his enemies, handled the matter so, as he cut off their landforces from their ships; and entoiled both their navy and their tamp with a greater power than theirs, both by sea and land: arid compelled them to render themselves without striking stroke and after they were at his mercy, contenting himself only with their oath that they should no more bear arms against him, dismissed them all in safety. 
Birds also were saved by flying to the high trees and woods. 
Only they take great pride and delight in the feathers of birds; and this also they took from those their ancestors of the mountains, who were invited unto it by the infinite flights of birds that came up to the high grounds, while the waters stood below. 
It is true, the like law against the admission of strangers without licence is an ancient law in the kingdom of China, and yet continued in use. 
“That king also, still desiring to join humanity and policy together; and thinking it against humanity, to detain strangers here against their wills, and against policy that they should return and discover their knowledge of this estate, he took this course: he did ordain that of the strangers that should be permitted to land, as many (at all times) might depart as would; but as many as would stay should have very good conditions and means to live from the state. 
“But now to come to our present purpose. 
One day there were two of our company bidden to a Feast of the Family, as they call it. 
When he is set; the room being always full of company, but well kept and without disorder; after some pause, there cometh in from the lower end of the room, a taratan (which is as much as an herald) and on either side of him two young lads; whereof one carrieth a scroll of their shining yellow parchment; and the other a cluster of grapes of gold, with a long foot or stalk. 
After the ceremony endeth the father or Tirsan retireth; and after some time cometh forth again to dinner, where he sitteth alone under the state, as before; and none of his descendants sit with him, of what degree or dignity soever, except he hap to be of Salomon’s House. 
To this he said, “You have reason for to commend that excellent institution of the Feast of the Family. And indeed we have experience that those families that are partakers of the blessing of that feast do flourish and prosper ever after in an extraordinary manner. 
And when he had said this, the good Jew paused a little; whereupon I, far more willing to hear him speak on than to speak myself, yet thinking it decent that upon his pause of speech I should not be altogether silent, said only this; “That I would say to him, as the widow of Sarepta said to Elias; that he was come to bring to memory our sins; and that I confess the righteousness of Bensalem was greater than the righteousness of Europe.” 
The day being come, he made his entry. 
The windows likewise were not crowded, but every one stood in them as if they had been placed. 
That done, the rest departed, and I remained. 
These caves we call the Lower Region; and we use them for all coagulations, indurations, refrigerations, and conservations of bodies. 
And these places we call the Upper Region; accounting the air between the high places and the low, as a Middle Region. 
“We have also fair and large baths, of several mixtures, for the cure of diseases, and the restoring of man’s body from arefaction: and others for the confirming of it in strength of sinewes, vital parts, and the very juice and substance of the body. 
We have drinks also brewed with several herbs, and roots, and spices; yea with several fleshes, and whitemeats; whereof some of the drinks are such, as they are in effect meat and drink both: so that divers, especially in age, do desire to live with them, with little or no meat or bread. 
We have also glasses and means to see small and minute bodies perfectly and distinctly; as the shapes and colours of small flies and worms, grains and flaws in gems, which cannot otherwise be seen, observations in urine and blood not otherwise to be seen. 
Also a number of fossils, and imperfect minerals, which you have not. Likewise loadstones of prodigious virtue; and other rare stones, both natural and artificial. 
For upon every invention of value, we erect a statue to the inventor, and give him a liberal and honourable reward. 
These statues are some of brass; some of marble and touchstone; some of cedar and other special woods gilt and adorned; some of iron; some of silver; some of gold. 
I give thee leave to publish it for the good of other nations; for we here are in God’s bosom, a land unknown.” 
Better still, the time has come for my friend to speak out fully. 
The impression made on Paris by this news may be easily imagined. 
To me she said "bon soir, Daddy Jacques" as she passed into The Yellow Room. 
I said to myself; for I must tell you, Monsieur, that, to the end of October, I live in an attic of the pavilion over The Yellow Room, so that Mademoiselle should not be left alone through the night in the lonely park. 
"The inspiration was that the window of The Yellow Room looks out in such a way that the park wall, which abuts on the pavilion, prevented my at once reaching the window. 
In a few words I told them what had happened, and directed the concierge to join Monsieur Stangerson with all speed, while his wife came with me to open the park gate. 
The door of the room locked on the inside and the blinds on the only window also fastened on the inside; and Mademoiselle still calling for help!No! she had ceased to call. 
I should tell you that, behind us, the concierge held the laboratory lampa powerful lamp, that lit the whole chamber. 
It is quite understood, Daddy Jacques, quite understood, that you are very fond of your masters; and you want them to know it, and never cease repeating itespecially since the discovery of your revolver. 
'I can only say that it is the strangest affair I have ever known. The more we think we know something, the further we are from knowing anything!' 
Mother Angenoux is a sort of saint, who lives in a hut in the heart of the forest, not far from the grotto of SainteGenevieve. 
I tried then to question him as to the cause of this change of humour, but each time he laughed and made me no answer. 
It was this case which was to rank him as the leading newspaper reporter, and to obtain for him the reputation of being the greatest detective in the world. 
"Whyby Mademoiselle Stangerson." 
That was why she took such precautionseven Daddy Jacques's revolverwithout telling him of it. 
He must have known that the attic was inhabited by Daddy Jacques, and that was one of the reasons, I think, why he must have used a quiet weapon,a lifepreserver, or a hammer." 
"Evidently," replied Rouletabille, rising, "and that is what has to be explained. 
"Is it becauseyou think there is something to be got out of him?" I asked. 
"A Man Has Passed Like a Shadow Through the Blinds" Half an hour later Rouletabille and I were on the platform of the Orleans station, awaiting the departure of the train which was to take us to EpinaysurOrge. 
The train was in motion. 
"An obscureincredible, unfathomable, inexplicable affairand there is only one thing I fear, Monsieur Rouletabille,that the journalists will be trying to explain it." 
"Yes," he said simply, "that is to be feared. 
"To the Chateau du Glandier," replied Rouletabille, without turning. 
"But it is to be hoped that Mademoiselle Stangerson's life will be saved." 
"Let us hope so. 
"Evidently; but, by a wonderful chance, it has not proved mortal. 
And he turned towards his Registrar as if he no longer knew us. 
I can assure you, for we have carefully examined the wound. 
Mademoiselle Stangerson had no need for one, since Daddy Jacques lodged in the pavilion and because, during the daytime, she never left her father. 
"Once more,how do you know that?" 
"Yes; there is a window, or rather skylight, in it, which, as it looks out towards the country, Monsieur Stangerson has had barred, like the rest of the windows. 
These bars, as in the other windows, have remained intact, and the blinds, which naturally open inwards, have not been unfastened. 
"Then what part did his revolver play in the tragedy?It seems very clear that this weapon did less harm to Mademoiselle Stangerson than it did to the murderer." 
"An hour and a half or an hour and three quarterseasy walking," the man replied. 
His head was bent down, he had his hands in his pockets, and he was whistling. 
Such was the chateau in which science had taken refugea place seemingly designed to be the theatre of mysteries, terror, and death. 
Some small houses on the side of the road leading to Corbeil, an inn, called the "Auberge du Donjon," which offered passing hospitality to waggoners; these were about all to represent civilisation in this outoftheway part of the country, but a few leagues from the capital. 
Monsieur Stangerson was already celebrated. 
I can refuse her nothing. 
One day, however, Monsieur Stangerson, as he was leaving the Academy of Science, announced that the marriage of his daughter and Monsieur Robert Darzac would be celebrated in the privacy of the Chateau du Glandier, as soon as he and his daughter had put the finishing touches to their report summing up their labours on the "Dissociation of Matter." 
"The concierges will not be able to give you any information, Monsieur Rouletabille." 
"I doubt it. 
The orders are strict." 
"I shall gain admission, if you let me see Monsieur Robert Darzac. 
Pale as he was, he became paler. 
"You'll fare very badly there; you'll not find anything" "Do you think so? 
On arriving this morning, the examining magistrate brought with him from Paris a revolver of the same calibre as that found in the room (for he couldn't use the one held for evidence), and made his Registrar fire two shots in The Yellow Room while the doors and windows were closed. 
2. Laboratory, with its two large, barred windows and its doors, one serving for the vestibule, the other for The Yellow Room. 
3. Vestibule, with its unbarred window and door opening into the park. 
With the lines of this plan and the description of its parts before them, my readers will know as much as Rouletabille knew when he entered the pavilion for the first time. With him they may now ask: How did the murderer escape from The Yellow Room? 
The medical experts who examined these traces yesterday affirm that they were made by the same hand as that which left its red imprint on the wall; an enormous hand, Monsieur, much too large to go into my gloves," he added with an indefinable smile. 
Rouletabille then said to me: "You must know, my friend, that the inquiry is a little more advanced than Monsieur de Marquet has chosen to tell us. 
Why is Monsieur de Marquet surrounding this muttonbone with so much mystery? No doubt for the purpose of facilitating the inquiries of the agents of the Surete? He imagines, perhaps, that the owner of this instrument of crime, the most terrible invented, is going to be found amongst those who are wellknown in the slums of Paris who use it. 
"Yes, Monsieur," said Robert Darzac, "at the foot of the bed; but I beg of you not to say anything about it." 
It was an old bone, which may, according to appearances, have served in other crimes. 
"My belief is that the wound would have been mortal, if the murderer's blow had not been arrested in the act by Mademoiselle Stangerson's revolver. 
It was closed and, as I immediately saw, partially shattered and out of commission. 
It was large and welllighted. 
But, occupied as he was at another window, he had seen nothing. 
I have only to open the blinds for you to see." 
Rouletabille went back into the laboratory, closed the shutters of the two windows and the door of the vestibule. 
When we were in complete darkness, he lit a wax vesta, and asked Daddy Jacques to move to the middle of the chamber with it to the place where the nightlight was burning that night. 
"See!see this blood on the wall!" I could not help exclaiming. 
"We are not fools; and there were four of us when we burst open the door!" 
Rouletabille went back to the door and carefully examined the lock and the bolt, satisfying himself that the door had certainly been burst open from the outside, and, further, that the key had been found in the lock on the inside of the chamber. 
He finally satisfied himself that with the key in the lock, the door could not possibly be opened from without with another key. 
We watched him in silence. 
Presently we heard him ask: "At what time, Monsieur Jacques, did Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson arrive at the laboratory?" 
He could not be better likened than to an admirable sporting dog on the scent of some unusual game. 
"Several moral,one material. 
"If the corpse can speak," I said, "it would be interesting to be there." 
"Q. What did you do on that day?I want you to be as minute and precise as possible. I wish to know all you did that day, if it is not asking too much of you. 
When I left my chamber, at halfpast ten, my father was already at work in the laboratory. 
"Q. And he found nothing suspicious there? 
"Monsieur Stangerson. It was closed. 
You returned to the laboratory at six o'clock and resumed work? "Mademoiselle Stangerson. 
He left me, to execute the errand and I rejoined my daughter, who was already at work. 
"Q. He saw nothing suspicious? 
That was taking unusual precautions, knowing that your father and your servant were there? 
"A. That is true. 
At this time of the season, every year, I have generally returned to my apartment in the chateau for the winter; but this year I said to myself that I would not quit the pavilion before my father had finished the resume of his works on the 'Dissociation of Matter' for the Academy. 
"Q. The door of The Yellow Room locked, did you go to bed? 
"A. I do not know whether I had been long asleep, but suddenly I awokeand uttered a loud cry. 
"A. A man was in my chamber. 
"A. I know nothing more, monsieur, than that a man threw himself upon me and that I fired at him. 
The fact of the closed window struck the reporter as it had struck the magistrate. 
"But if he did shut the window, it was because of the bend in the gravel path, a dozen yards from the pavilion, and on account of the three oaks that are growing at that spot." 
"I'll explain all to you later on, Monsieur, when I think the moment to be ripe for doing so; but I don't think I have anything of more importance to say on this affair, if my hypothesis is justified." 
Why, I asked myself, if he was really afraid that the murderer should be discovered, was he helping the reporter to find him? 
See, just in front of the little path leading to the lake, that was his nearest way to get out." 
A few minutes later we reached the lake. 
"What makes you think that?" 
"What makes me think that?Why these footprints, which I expected to find!" he cried, pointing to the sharply outlined imprint of a neat boot. 
That accounts for the lightness of the impression made by the wheels along it, in spite of the softness of the ground. If there had been a man on the bicycle, the wheels would have sunk deeply into the soil. 
No, no; there was but one man there, the murderer on foot." 
Do you know whether there is one at the chateau?" 
"You'd make a wonderful detectiveif you had a little more methodif you didn't follow your instincts and that bump on your forehead. 
You have seen the stain on the wall, but I have only seen the handkerchief." 
And laughing a little, in a slightly bantering tone, his hands in his pockets, Rouletabille fixed his cunning eyes on the great Fred. Frederic Larsan silently contemplated the young reporter who pretended to be as wise as himself. 
When we were close to him, he deigned to see us and asked us, in a tone anything but engaging, whether we wanted anything. 
"I'm not afraid of the policeI'm not afraid of anyone!" replied the man. 
"Come on," he said, "it is very comfortable here." 
The room was a tolerably large one, furnished with two heavy tables, some stools, a counter decorated with rows of bottles of syrup and alcohol. 
"That's a fine fire for roasting a chicken," said Rouletabille. 
"We have no chickennot even a wretched rabbit," said the landlord. 
His movements displayed an almost aristocratic ease. 
His flashing eyes, his clenched hands, his trembling lips, told us of the tumultuous feelings by which he was being agitated. "He has done well not to come in here today!" he hissed. 
"Who is that man?" asked Rouletabille, returning to his omelette. 
"Yet they've been arrested?" 
That's what I think of itand many things besides; but that's nobody's business." 
"If ever you should have any scraps for the Bete du Bon Dieu?" 
And she entered, followed by a cat, larger than any I had ever believed could exist. 
Slamming the door behind him, the innkeeper left the room. 
"Then how was it, Madame Angenoux, that all through the night of the murder nothing but the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu was heard?" 
Mother Angenoux planted herself in front of the forestkeeper and struck the floor with her stick. "I don't know anything about it," she said. 
"But shall I tell you something? 
I crossed myself when I heard that, as if I had heard the devil." 
At that moment, the noise of loud quarrelling reached us. 
The landlord hates him. 
In Which Frederic Larsan Explains How the Murderer Was Able to Get Out of The Yellow Room Among the mass of papers, legal documents, memoirs, and extracts from newspapers, which I have collected, relating to the mystery of The Yellow Room, there is one very interesting piece; it is a detail of the famous examination which took place that afternoon, in the laboratory of Professor Stangerson, before the Chief of the Surete. 
It was given to me by the Registrar himself, some time after the astonishing denouement to this case, and is unique in judicial chronicles. 
The concierges may, for the moment, forget that they have been arrested. 
Then, passing before me, he said in a low voice: "What do you think of that, eh? What a scene! 
Could you have thought of that? 
She still won admiration for her imperial beauty which had remained intact, without a wrinkle, withstanding time and love. 
I asked, obeying, in thus mixing myself in the conversation, the express orders of my chief, "as soon as you heard the cry of 'murder' followed by the revolver shots, what became of the desk?" 
"Might not a man in the room, the desk being so near to the door, by stooping and slipping under the desk, have left it unobserved?" 
"If we could only lay hands on the murderer, he'd never taste bread again!" the woman gurgled between her sobs. 
If you had heard one, you would have heard the other." 
"Mon Dieu! Monsieurit was the second shot we heard. 
"Yes," replied the Professor, "there were two shots, one dull, and the other sharp and ringing." 
The professor looked sadly at Monsieur Robert Darzac. 
Monsieur Stangerson made a visible effort to recover himself. 
It will be best that you should know something which, if I concealed it, might appear to be of importance; Monsieur Darzac agrees with me in this." 
The Chief smiled. "Ah,young RouletabilleI've heard of him he is considered rather clever. 
For God's sake, do not say a word of this to my daughter. 
"Twenty years of my life," replied the illustrious professor sadly, "or rather of our livesthe lives of myself and my daughter! 
Yes, our most precious documents, the records of our secret experiments and our labours of twenty years were in that cabinet. 
In our profession and for the general welfare, we have to put up with such mortifications and bury selfish feelings. 
Daddy Jacques bent over them and, stupefied, recognised a pair of old boots which he had, some time back, thrown into a corner of his attic. 
Don't be alarmed, Daddy Jacques; we are quite sure that you were not the murderer; you never left the side of Monsieur Stangerson. 
There was a chemical experiment being carried on between ten and eleven o'clock, with Monsieur Stangerson, his daughter, and Daddy Jacques engaged at the furnace in a corner of the high chimney. 
We do not know who committed the crime; we do not know of what wretch Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson are the victims, but there is no doubt that they both know! 
In crossing the park, he said to me: "Frederic is really very clever and has not belied his reputation. 
That escaped me; but my mind was turned in another direction by the large number of false indications of his track which the murderer left, and by the measure of the black footmarks corresponding with that of Daddy Jacques's boots, which I had established without his suspecting it, on the floor of The Yellow Room. 
It is going to be a terrible matter; for I tell you he is working on wrong lines, and II, must fight him with nothing!" 
I was surprised at the profoundly grave accent with which my young friend pronounced the last words. 
"After you, pray!" 
"Good evening, Monsieur Sainclair!" It was Frederic Larsan. 
"I left it near the tree." He left us, saying he would rejoin us presently. 
As I had to wait twenty minutes for the train at Epinay, we entered a wine shop. 
"Recent?" insisted Rouletabille. 
Fred's cane is new. 
Now, I confess it without shame, I am not a hero. 
But here was a friend, evidently in danger, calling on me to go to his aid. 
I did not hesitate long; and after assuring myself that the only revolver I possessed was properly loaded, I hurried towards the Orleans station. 
When one looks closely into it, the reasoning is absurd, seeing that the 'intimate'if there is onemust have known that the professor would shortly leave the pavilion, and that the 'friend' had only to put off operating till after the professor's departure. 
It was the phrase which you found on the halfburned piece of paper amongst the ashes in the laboratory." 
I stopped in the darkness and silence. 
But another phrase was uttered by Monsieur Robert Darzac: 'Must I commit a crime, then, to win you?' 
Then they went away. 
Mademoiselle Stangerson, I thought, was not even listening to what he was saying, her face expressing perfect indifference. 
I talked with him about Philadelphia; he told me he had lived there for fiveandtwenty years, and that it was there he had met the illustrious Professor Stangerson and his daughter. 
At the time I could not really think seriously of anything. 
'You were on the point of being married, Monsieur,' I said negligently and without looking at him, 'and suddenly your marriage becomes impossible because of the writer of that letter; because as soon as his letter was read, you spoke of the necessity for a crime to win Mademoiselle Stangerson. 
A hundred other roads are open to you in your search for the criminal. 
Now even admitting that the letter was written by himwhich I do not believehe knew that Mademoiselle Stangerson had received it, since he had seen it in her hands in the garden at the Elysee. 
"The most serious fact is that Monsieur Darzac was, at the very same time that his double presented himself at the Post Office, scheduled for a lecture at the Sorbonne. He had not delivered that lecture, and one of his friends took his place. 
Now does that hypothesis really mislead Frederic Larsan? 
But so long as I am not sure of the real murderer, I cannot state the theory on which I am working. 
As we passed round the donjon, we met the Green Man, the forestkeeper, who did not greet us, but walked by as if we had not existed. 
"An odd kind of fish!" Rouletabille said to me, in a low tone. 
We then went back into the building. 
This gallery, high and wide, extended along the whole length of the building and was lit from the front of the chateau facing the north. 
Professor Stangerson inhabited the left wing of the building. 
At about twothirds of its length this gallery, at a right angle, joined another gallery following the course of the right wing. 
I had not had time to glance round the place in which he had been installed, when he uttered a cry of surprise and pointed to a pair of eyeglasses on a sidetable. 
"Yes," he replied, "I had them liberated, I needed people I could trust. 
"Because I know that he must come." 
Think of it!every time the murderer comes to the chateau, Monsieur Darzac, by a strange fatality, absents himself and refuses to give any account of how he employs his time." 
Cold wind and rain; opaque darkness; silence. 
Again the sound of the cat's weird cry in the distance. 
"Again the cry of the Bete du Bon Dieu!and then silence. 
He had come, then, from without in this wretched night. 
I push it, without making the least noise. 
"As I am almost sure that the murderer is there, why do I not at once give the alarm? 
"All these reflections ran through my brain like a flash of lightning. 
I returned to Daddy Jacques and whispered the word 'ladder' in his ear. 
"What were my thoughts then? 
"At the same instant the sinister cry of the Bete du bon Dieu arrested me in my ascent. It seemed to me to have come from close by meonly a few yards away. 
His back was turned toward me. 
A candle was lit before him, and he bent over the flame, the light from it projecting shapeless shadows. 
"She is not in there.' 
"Thanks,' I said; 'You are a brave man.' 
"When I had sworn to him that his daughter was not in the room, and in no danger, he conquered his impatience and left me to direct the operations. 
"If there be any inclined to smile at my taking so many precautionary measures, I refer them to the mystery of The Yellow Room, and to all the proofs we have of the weird cunning of the murderer. 
I saw his head. 
We would have looked into a flowerpot, if there had been one to look into!" 
He who could understand all this, would have to assume that Mademoiselle Stangerson knew that the murderer was comingshe could not prevent his coming againunknown to her father, unknown to all but to Monsieur Robert Darzac. 
There could be but two reasons why he had assisted me in my investigation. First, because I forced him to do it; and, second, because she would be the better protected. 
He smiled at her and seemed not to know either what he said or what he did. The illustrious professor had lost his head. 
Daddy Jacques blows his nose, and Frederic Larsan himself is obliged to turn away to hide his emotion. 
"He knows the chateau,' he said to me; 'he knows it well.' 
"So much the better. 
Did you notice the marks on the carpet?Come and look at them.' 
"I have seen them; they are the marks of the neat boots, the same as those we saw on the border of the lake.' 
Some might think that we were rather late in thinking of the keeper, since our first business, after having found that the murderer had escaped us in the gallery, ought to have been to search everywhere else,around the chateau,in the park"Had this criticism been made at the time, we could only have answered that the assassin had disappeared from the gallery in such a way that we thought he was no longer anywhere! 
"Does that open out any new view to you?' 
Rouletabille Has Drawn a Circle Between the Two Bumps on His Forehead (EXTRACT FROM THE NOTEBOOK OF JOSEPH ROULETABILLE, continued) "We separated on the thresholds of our rooms, with a melancholy shake of the hands. 
"If I could but find a right startingpoint! 
It might convince an examining magistrate or the head of a detective department, but it's not proof. 
That circle may be the most circumscribed, but if it is, it has this advantageit holds nothing but the truth! 
I am sure he was not himself in the least conscious of the originality of his genius. 
Rouletabille looked at me pityingly, smiled carelessly, and remarked that I was reasoning like a postman, orlike Frederic Larsan. 
"Hullo!" muttered Rouletabille. "Arthur Rance!"He lowered his head, quickened his pace, and I heard him ask himself between his teeth: "Was he in the chateau that night? 
We had gone some distance from the chateau when I asked him who this Arthur Rance was, and how he had come to know him. 
"Be ready for me this evening." 
"Doesn't he question you?" "Never. 
We reached the Donjon Inn and entered it. 
She spoke in a soft voice. 
She disappeared into the kitchen to prepare our repast, leaving on the table a bottle of excellent cider. 
He did not try to hide that he believed her to be once more in danger. 
His anticipation of coming danger had come to him solely from the coincidence that Mademoiselle Stangerson had been twice attacked, and both times when he had been absent. 
The examining magistrate and Monsieur Larsan are both on the point of believing in my guilt. 
Since you have been here I have appreciated your exceptional intelligence and your unequalled ingenuity. 
Perhaps I am wrong to fear an attack during the coming night; but, as I must act with foresight, I count on you to frustrate any attempt that may be made. 
If you keep watch his very cunning may save her; because it's impossible that he should not know that you are watching; and knowing it, he may not venture.' 
And, indeed, he must have been at his wits' end, to have come to me at such a time, and to abandon Mademoiselle Stangerson in spite of his fixed idea as to the consequence. 
Rouletabille chaffed her a little, and she took the chaff with the most charming good humour. 
"I have been sure since halfpast ten o'clock this morning that he would come. I knew that before we saw Arthur Rance at the window in the court." 
You don't risk anything! 
Why should it not have been a summons to a meeting? Might he not, as soon as he was sure of Darzac's absence, appoint the meeting for 'the coming night?" 
You are a bright little fellow." 
Arthur Rance spoke French perfectly,almost without an accent. 
To my amazement the young reporter answered that it was a matter of entire indifference to him whether he did or not. 
From this recess I could see all that occurred in the gallery as well as if I had been standing in front of Arthur Rance's door, and I could watch that door, too. 
"You will immediately come towards me, behind the man; but I shall already be upon him, and shall have seen his face." I attempted a feeble smile. 
"And if the man escapes?" 
That's all I want. I shall know afterwards what to do so that as far as Mademoiselle Stangerson is concerned he shall be dead to her even though he continues to live. 
"And what we saw her do was done to send her father to sleep?" 
"Then there are but two of us for tonight's work?" 
I kept silence for awhile, then, anxious to know his thoughts, I asked him point blank: "Why not tell Arthur Rance?He may be of great assistance to us?" 
We are going to operate alone, on our own personal account." 
Larsan smiled at the explanation like a man who was not fooled and politely refrains from making the slightest remark on matters which did not concern him. 
"Then you think the conclusion of the matter has been reached?" 
"Well, I am sure he is not. 
So it's a fight then?" 
We were extremely distressed, both on his account and on our own, for we had partaken of all the dishes he had eaten. 
Rouletabille's embrace came back to my mind. 
My friend had told me that, probably, nothing would occur before midnight or one o'clock in the morning. 
He was wearing the same costume that he had worn when I first saw him on the road in front of the Donjon Inn. 
As the cry of the Bete du Bon Dieu came for the third time, he put down the package and went to the second window, counting from the dark closet. 
All I had to do was obey instructions. 
Half an hour passed, an age to me. What was I to do now, even if I saw something? 
I could hear nothing. 
This, no doubt, was the work of Mademoiselle Stangerson. 
I was not master of myself. I fired. 
I ran behind him, shouting: "Stop!stop! or I will kill you!" 
The window of the vestibule was open. 
"Let us carry him to the vestibule then." 
He could not have shown greater grief had the body been that of his own son. 
Then snatching the lantern from Daddy Jacques, he held it over the corpse and saw a gaping wound. Rising suddenly he exclaimed in a voice filled with savage irony: "The man you believe to have been shot was killed by the stab of a knife in his heart!" 
"Yes; the mystery is no longer a mystery. 
This morning, walking round the chateau, I found two distinct sets of footprints, made at the same time, last night. 
We met again, however, in Daddy Jacques's room to which our separate trains of thinking had led us both. 
"And you were not alone!' cried Larsan. 
"No!I saw nothing but black veils.' 
"Daddy Jacques,' I said, in a threatening voice, 'you did not follow it; you and the phantom walked to Epinay togetherarm in arm!' 
Everything!" he exclaimed. 
Rouletabille Knows the Two Halves of the Murderer Mademoiselle Stangerson had been almost murdered for the second time. 
The slightest allusion to the terrible incident sent her into delirium, and the arrest of Robert Darzac which followed on the day following the tragic death of the keeper seemed to sink her fine intelligence into complete melancholia. 
He went back to the gallery automatically, opened a window, shouted his order to fire, and then returned to the room. He crossed the deserted boudoir, entered the drawingroom, and tried to rouse Monsieur Stangerson who was lying on a sofa. 
Monsieur Stangerson rose stupidly and let himself be drawn by Rouletabille into the room where, on seeing his daughter's body, he uttered a heartrending cry. 
I kept back any information as to my being in the dark closet and said nothing about the drugging. 
Finding that the keeper did not keep his appointment, he, Bernier, had gone in search of him. 
However that might be, the examining magistrate did not pursue his inquiry further in this direction. 
We exchanged meaningful glances. 
The door of the drawingroom was then opened and we heard the magistrate calling to the gendarme who entered. 
He looked at us and, his eyes falling on the railway servant, his features stiffened and he could hardly repress a groan. We were all much moved by the appearance of the man. 
"I do," said Monsieur Darzac, in a tone which he vainly tried to make firm. 
He would certainly have spoken to him, but Darzac, by a gesture, held him off. 
As the gendarme approached his prisoner, a despairing cry rang through the room: "Robert!Robert!" 
Rouletabille and I remained on the threshold. 
Rouletabille's voice had in it a strange strength and confidence. 
I shall know only what will benefit you." 
We reached Paris about eight o'clock, dined, and then, tired out, we separated, agreeing to meet the next morning at my rooms. 
There never has been a case with so many obscure, incomprehensible, and inexplicable points. 
It is to be hoped that Mademoiselle Stangerson will shortly recover her reason, which has been temporarily unhinged by the horrible mystery at the Glandier. 
The gentleman who brought us this message would not give us his name. 
This goes to show to what a pitch of madness nervous excitement may carry people. 
Rouletabille was still expected. 
I was there, of course, as were all who had, in any way, been in touch with the mysteries of the Glandier. 
It is not, however, my intention to report in detail the course of the trial. 
Frederic Larsan was brought in. 
The steamer was late. 
But the President was extremely incensed: "So, you are Joseph Rouletabille," he replied; "well, young man, I'll teach you what comes of making a farce of justice. 
"Are you going to tell us who the murderer was?" asked the President, somewhat convinced though still sceptical. 
"I have no doubt you are," said my friend. 
These meetings became more frequent when her husband was laid up by his rheumatism. 
She gave him morphine to ease his pain and to give herself more time for the meetings. 
He did not reach the court until he heard the revolver shots, and then he fired. 
Monsieur Robert Darzac's footprints are also like the murderer's, and yet he is not the murderer!" 
"Then if the man was hemmed in that narrow square, how is it you did not find him?I have been asking you that for the last half hour." 
By this time the people in the courtroom were beginning to believe in this new witness. 
They were amused by his melodramatic action in thus fixing the hour; but they seemed to have confidence in the outcome. 
He showed himself very friendly to all except Arthur Rance to whom he exhibited a marked coldness of manner. 
I have now brought what I consider the indisputable proof." 
The quick silence which followed was broken by the distinctly whispered words from the lips of Robert Darzac: "It's impossible! 
The usher hurried to the side door, opened it, and disappeared. The door remained open, while all eyes turned expectantly towards it. 
"Explain yourself?" demanded the President. 
"He could give no other answer than the one he has now given by his flight." 
Monsieur Darzac; you don't think I am mad, now!" cried Rouletabille. 
Knowing all about him and who he was, he afforded the criminal an opportunity for another laugh at the society he had defied! 
The crowd had barely recovered from the effect of the astonishing revelation when the hearing was resumed. 
Had I seen Frederic Larsan and the murderer at the same time?No!Two seconds had passed, during which I lost sight of the murderer; for, as I have noted in my papers, he arrived two seconds before Monsieur Stangerson, Daddy Jacques, and myself at the meetingpoint of the two galleries. 
Then I returned to Mademoiselle Stangerson's chamber where I had seen the unknown. 
And he was very nearly captured. 
"What, then, was the urgent reason which had compelled Larsan to go to the room a second time? 
"Yes, Monsieur; but she was ignorant of the fact that the man who was pursuing her was Frederic Larsan, otherwise, of course, he would not have been allowed to be at the chateau. 
Rouletabille coughed. 
A movement of chairs in the court with a rustling of dresses and an energetic whispering of "Hush!" showed the curiosity that had been aroused. 
"You forget that, stunned by the attack made on her, Mademoiselle Stangerson was not in a condition to have made such an appeal. Nor could she have locked and bolted herself in her room. 
"There was no need for him to escapeif he was not there!" 
"That, Monsieur President, is where we have taken hold of the wrong end. 
Owing to her disturbed state of mind she had forgotten that Daddy Jacques would go into her room and had begged him not to trouble himself. All this was set forth in the article in the 'Matin.' 
"My reasoning had thus brought me to the second phase of the tragedy, when Mademoiselle Stangerson was alone in the room. 
Her hand wildly seeks the revolver she had placed within her reach on the nighttable by the side of her bed, but her hand, striking the table, overturns it, and the revolver, falling to the floor, discharges itself, the bullet lodging in the ceiling. 
"I had now to explain the wound on the temple. 
We established the fact that the murderer had introduced himself into the pavilion between five and six o'clock. 
At five the professor had been with his daughter, and since the attack took place in the professor's absence from his daughter, I had to find out just when he left her. 
Mademoiselle Stangerson was not with him then since the professor said: 'I left the keeper and rejoined my daughter who was at work in the laboratory.' 
"It was during that short interval of time that the tragedy took place. 
He had been in the pavilion for some time waiting for her. 
Mademoiselle Stangerson came in. 
Mademoiselle tried to call for help; but the man had seized her by the throat. 
Her hand had sought and grasped the revolver which she had been keeping in the drawer of her nighttable, since she had come to fear the threats of her pursuer. 
"We must assume, Monsieur President, that Monsieur Robert Darzac's absences are closely connected with Mademoiselle Stangerson's secret, and that Monsieur Darzac feels himself in honour bound to remain silent. 
He proved the innocence of one before accusing the other. You can easily believe, Monsieur, that so complicated a scheme as this must have been long and carefully thought out in advance by Larsan. 
They were extremely compromising, which explains his distress at the time when we spoke to him about them. 
Larsan confessed it all to me. 
He is an artist at the game. 
In Which It Is Proved That One Does Not Always Think of Everything Great excitement prevailed when Rouletabille had finished. 
Search was everywhere made for Frederic Larsan, but in vain. Monsieur Darzac finally escaped the awful calamity which, at one time, had threatened him. 
After a visit to Mademoiselle Stangerson, he was led to hope that she might, by careful nursing, one day recover her reason. 
I had come to that conclusion through the incident of the 'inexplicable gallery.' 
If you ask why Larsan bought the cane, if he had no intention of manufacturing evidence against Darzac by means of it, the answer is quite simple. He had been wounded in the hand by Mademoiselle Stangerson, so that the cane was useful to enable him to close his hand in carrying it. 
His wound was troubling him and, as he was passing along the Avenue de l'Opera, the idea of the cane came to his mind and he acted on it. 
He was said to be rich and had asked her of her father. 
Monsieur Stangerson, on making inquiries as to Monsieur Jean Roussel, found that the man was a swindler and an adventurer. 
A report was spread, a few weeks later, that he was dead, and she now determined to atone for her disobedience by a life of labour and devotion for her father. 
All this she had confessed to Robert Darzac, and, believing Ballmeyer dead, had given herself to the joy of a union with him. 
The third time she had determined to keep the appointment. 
It was to rescue these papers that she made up her mind to see him. 
And yet the whole of this mystery has not been revealed. 
Nothing! 
It's jamthat's what it is. 
Hand me that switch." 
I reckon you're a kind of a singed cat, as the saying isbetter'n you look. 
No you can't, either." 
Presently the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy and pounding him with his fists. Holler 'nuff!" said he. 
Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist; then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as before. 
That put the thing in a new light. 
Tom, don't lie to meI can't bear it." 
She went out to see for herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent of Tom's statement true. 
His soul was at peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble. 
As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new girl in the gardena lovely little blueeyed creature with yellow hair plaited into two long tails, white summer frock and embroidered pantalettes. 
Finally he rode home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions. 
Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was silent. 
Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. 
What is it, Mary, tell me what it is." 
Piece of lickrish and a fishhook." 
That's very well. But you've another one I daresay, and you'll tell it to me, won't you?" 
Fine boy. 
Two thousand verses is a great manyvery, very great many. 
Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was sick; then he could stay home from school. 
It'll be over by and by, maybe. Don't call anybody." But I must! Don't groan so, Tom, it's awful. 
Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. 
Where'd you get the blue ticket?" 
No, sir, you can bet he didn't, becuz he's the wartiest boy in this town; and he wouldn't have a wart on him if he'd knowed how to work spunkwater. 
I've took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way, Huck. 
Out in the woods." What'll you take for him?" I don't know. 
It's Thomas Sawyer." That's the name they lick me by. I'm Tom, when I'm good. 
You only just tell a boy you won't ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that's all. 
Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded: Now Becky, it's all doneall over but the kiss. Don't you be afraid of thatit ain't anything at all. 
This was despair. 
A cry of "Scat! you devil!" and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt's woodshed brought him wide awake, and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the "ell" on all fours. 
They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of mould and gravel. 
It's a dirty business," said Joe, without moving. 
O, I didn't know what I was adoing. 
Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. 
Because he'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. 
Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and an F, and the oath was complete. 
At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle, and voices shouted, "It's him! it's him! he's coming himself!" 
Then he said: Something told me 't if I didn't come back and get" He shuddered; then waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, "Tell them, Joe, tell themit ain't any use any more." 
Why I never see anything like it. 
Hadn't any aunt!you numscull. 
It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. 
He sat up and rubbed his eyes and looked around. 
They tramped gaily along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush, among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the ground with a drooping regalia of grapevines. 
A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. 
Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. 
This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all. 
We'll stay, won't we Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get along without him, per'aps." But Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly on with his dressing. 
In the course of it Aunt Polly said: Well, I don't say it wasn't a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody suffering 'most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you could be so hardhearted as to let me suffer so. 
Not the first time, neither. 
They began to tell their adventures to hungry listenersbut they only began; it was not a thing likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish material. 
I did comedidn't you see me?" 
O, that's jolly. 
And me?" said Sally Rogers. 
And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate her with the performance. 
Jealousy ran red hot through Tom's veins. He began to hate himself for throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. 
Tom thought, grating his teeth. 
What did you come for, then?" It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn't got drownded." 
It ain't a lie, auntie, it's the truth. 
Tom Takes Becky's Punishment THERE WAS SOMETHING about Aunt Polly's manner, when she kissed Tom, that swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again. 
It was a precious moment. 
At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer stepped in at the door, and caught a glimpse of the picture. 
The next girl was Becky Thatcher. 
Never a word?" 
Why if I wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they could get me to tell. 
That's just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he's a goner. 
As the twilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood of the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that something would happen that might clear away their difficulties. 
A groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and rocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned in the courtroom. 
Tom beganhesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his words flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased but his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and bated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time, rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. 
His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper magnified him. 
Anyway it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marksa paper that's got to be ciphered over about a week because it's mostly signs and hy'rogliphics." 
In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the promise was a fraudthere was nothing in it. Their courage was up now and well in hand. 
Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe said: I'm dead for sleep! It's your turn to watch." 
Presently the watcher began to nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now. 
Huck said: I cantI'd die if they was to wake." 
O, partly, partly. 
Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. 
He ran and brought the boys' pick and shovel. 
I know it," said Injun Joe; "and this looks like it, I should say." Now you won't need to do that job." The halfbreed frowned. Said heYou don't know me. 
They ain't no numbers here." Well, that's so. Lemme think a minute. 
In the less ostentatious house No. 2 was a mystery. 
The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattletrap of a brick store. 
Why he might 'a' found out he couldn't get his revenge, and be going right after that money." 
I'd never 'a' thought of the towel, I bet!" Well, I would. 
All you got to do is to trot up Hooper street a block and meowand if I'm asleep, you throw some gravel at the window and that'll fetch me." 
That's all right. Now where you going to sleep?" 
Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o'clock a giddy and rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher's, and everything was ready for a start. 
The children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twentythree or thereabouts. 
Ten o'clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began to wink out, all straggling foot passengers disappeared, the village betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the silence and the ghosts. 
He was all attention in an instant. 
Nowthis waynow you see, don't you?" 
Huck felt that a silence was going to ensuea thing still more awful than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing, onelegged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one side and then on the other. 
Down, down he sped, till he reached the Welchman's. 
The deaf and dumb man said all that!" 
Why what's the matter with you?" 
The people had stopped moving out of church. 
O, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid," said Becky. It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know;" and he shouted again. 
Tom took something out of his pocket. 
Aunt Polly had drooped into a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. The village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn. 
Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore Judge Thatcher. 
Huck, it's in the cave!" Huck's eyes blazed. 
The money's in the cave!" 
Tom,honest injun, nowis it fun, or earnest?" Earnest, Huckjust as earnest as ever I was in my life. 
Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock stood in. 
That ain't no bad notion, Tom!" said Huck with animation. 
Mary got your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody's been fretting about you. 
It's one of the widow's parties that she's always having. This time it's for the Welchman and his sons, on account of that scrape they helped her out of the other night. And sayI can tell you something, if you want to know." 
She went straight off and told Tom about it. Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some day. 
Tom saw his opportunityLookyhere, Huck, being rich ain't going to keep me back from turning robber." 
Didn't you let me go for a pirate?" 
You should see it. 
Dive sixhere we are again|on the deck of Titanic. 
I want you guys working the ''D'' deck, reception and the dining saloon. 
Just chill, boss. 
We did it, Bobby ! Oh, yeah ! 
There's plenty of places it could be. 
Can you tell us who the woman in the picture is ? 
It is me, dear. 
How extraordinary ! 
You can be blasé about some things, Rose, but not about Titanic. 
My coat ? 
You know somebody ? 
Let's stoke them right up ! 
We're going full ahead ! 21 knots, sir. 
What do you mean, no, I won't ? 
I'm involved now. 
Maybe a couple of degrees over. 
You can do it. 
I was leaning over and I slipped. 
So I left and I haven't been back since. 
You could just call me a tumbleweed blowing in the wind. 
Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile around this boat deck and chewed over how great the weather's been and how l grew up, but I reckon that's not why you came to talk to me, is it ? 
I sought you out to thank you... 
This is my part of the ship. 
Well... these are rather good. 
Jack, this is exquisite work. They didn't like them in old Paris. 
You used her several times. 
She had a good sense of humour, though. 
I need to catch up on my gossip. 
I couldn't possibly, Jack. 
Charmed, I'm sure. 
You and my son are just about the same size. 
You could almost pass for a gentleman ! 
My dear, it's delightful to see you. 
There's the Countess of Rothes. And, um... that's John Jacob Astor, the richest man on the ship. 
Are you of the Boston Dawsons ? 
New money, obviously, but still a member of the club. 
Tell us of the accommodations in steerage, Mr Dawson. 
He was kind enough to show me some of his work today. 
Not to impugn your work, sir. 
Your ship is a wonder, Mr Andrews. Thank you, Rose. 
I work my way from place to place. You know, tramp steamers and such. 
The other night I slept under a bridge. Now I'm on the grandest ship in the world having champagne with you fine people. 
Here you go, Molly. 
Time for me to row with the other slaves. 
I'm gonna dance with her now, all right ? 
Like this. 
Whaaa.....jurisdiction of the Sherman Act, so my lawyers will argue. 
You all right ? 
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me. 
I'm sorry, Trudy. 
With the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned it seems there are not enough for everyone. 
I have built you a good ship, strong and true. 
I don't think so. 
Rose decided she wanted lavender. 
Ruth saw some of my designs in "La Mode Illustree". 
I changed my mind. 
Keep your eyes closed. 
Do you know his work ? 
It was the most erotic moment of my life. 
To the stars. 
Did you ever find those binoculars ? 
Did you see the... ? 
I know ! 
Look at that, would ya ? 
Did you see anything ? 
Please, sir, please... everything's under control. 
You there. Sir, there is no emergency. 
I was gonna return it. We have an honest thief, do we ? 
There's no stopping it. 
The pumps buy you time, but minutes only. 
But this ship can't sink. 
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it ? Look at me when l'm talking to you ! 
Please tell me the truth. 
Come towards me ! 
Steady ! 
I've been asked to give you this small token of our appreciation. 
I hope they're not too crowded. 
There's plenty of room for you. 
Where would they take someone under arrest ? You have to get to a boat right away. 
I'm doing this with or without your help, but without will take longer. 
I'm going back up ! No ! No ! 
Miss, wait ! 
I'm sorry ! I'm so sorry ! 
Check right here, Rose. 
You have to go find help. 
Good. Try to hit the same mark again, Rose. 
Okay. That's enough practice. 
Listen, Rose... I trust you. 
Come on, let's go ! 
That's White Star Line property ! 
These boats may buckle. 
Get them back from those gates ! 
The boats are all gone. This whole place is flooding. 
This way ! Go back to the main stairwell and everything will be sorted out there. 
Open the gate. 
Open the gate now ! 
I'm a businessman, as you know, and I've a business proposition for you. 
Put this on. 
Stop her ! 
Get back ! We had a deal, damn you. 
I have a child ! 
We are dressed in our best and are prepared to go down as gentlemen. But we would like a brandy. 
Capitan, where should I go ? 
I need a knife ! 
Over the rail ! 
You'll swamp us ! 
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace... 
Give me your hand ! 
Kick for the surface and keep kicking. 
You don't understand. lf we go back, they'll swamp the boat ! They'll pull us right down ! 
Do you people want to live or do you want to die ! 
Now make sure that's tied up nice and tight. 
Let's get some space there. 
Don't you do that. 
These are dead, sir. 
Six... out of 1,500. 
There's no other list. Perhaps he's on another ship. 
He married, of course, and inherited his millions. But the crash of '29 hit his interests hard and he put a pistol in his mouth that year. Or so I read. 
He exists now only in my memory. 
I was saving this for when I found the diamond. 
I'm sorry.

"Sometimes you can be impossibly dense." 
No," he said, "as a matter of fact, you're not dying. 
"Throe injury is not mortal, dear friend," Ariana confirmed gently. 
"Truly, thou art not dying."

I will take some few dozen men and smash this threat from the south." 
We eagerly await the practical wisdom of the King of the Sendars," Korodullin replied with extravagant courtesy. 
While the rest of the column pushed on toward the headwaters of the River Mardu, the miniature army under the command of Barak, Hettar, and Mandorallen veered to the south to intercept the enemy spearhead. 
The princess, however, did not sleep that night. For the first time, members of her army were committed to a real battle, and she tossed and turned the entire night, imagining all manner of disasters. 
The huge man was grinning broadly. 
They never knew what hit them." 
Then slowly, almost as if he were putting his arm into a fire, Relg reached out and took her hand. 
They looked into each other's eyes for a moment, then walked off together, hand in hand. 
Anheg looked at him sharply. 
I wish it was over," she sighed. 
The brownbearded King Fulrach was loudly protesting the decision to leave his supply wagons behind at the rapids. 
you worry too much." 
I thought we came here to fight Angaraks," Brand said mildly. 
The man quickly raised a tall pole with a bit of bright red bunting nailed to its tip, and the fleet behind them slowed in answer to the signal. 
The zealot nodded. 
"What you think of as darkness is normal light for us," he replied. 
He seemed unsurprised by her presence or by the fact that she had spoken to him. 
Do you hate the Angaraks so much that missing the chance to kill them causes you pain?" 
I hold no personal rancor toward the men of Angarak, and it is improper to hate throe opponent in a test of arms. 
I am Sir Beridel," he replied, "son of Sir Andorig, Baron of Vo Enderig." 
I would ride with them this night but for this stroke of ill fortune." 
That might not be enough." 
The spearhead of the assault slid silently by, following Relg and his Ulgos toward the fortified island city of the Thulls. 
"It actually worked!" 
Catapult!" Barak shouted, pointing at the walls looming ahead. 
As soon as they get the planking in place, the troops on the other side will be able to cross." Can you tell if the men inside have taken the south gate yet?" Olban demanded, peering toward the city. 
I'd give anything to be there," Olban lamented. 
"They've been amusing themselves by killing the Grolims we flushed out of the temple." 
Anheg suddenly chuckled, an evil sort of sound. "How's Grodeg?" he asked. 
How long will it take you to get to the Sea of the East?" ChoHag asked. A couple of days," Anheg told him. 
It will take your army a week at least to get back to the forts, won't it?" 
"The infantry can't move all that fast. There's Brendig! 
I don't see anything." 
The plain to the south is covered with Murgos." 
Polgara raised her face and closed her eyes. 
A moment or so later there was a rushing sound of wings, and the large hawk settled to the sand not far from their flickering fire. 
His face was grave. 
It was a test of our commitment," Varana explained. 
It is with me," Hettar said grimly. 
"Then, too, there's that." 
I want to hold the Mimbrate knights in reserve until the Malloreans mass up for their first charge." 
The cloudbank Polgara had pointed out was sweeping toward them with an alarming speed, a seething darkness of rolling purple, stalking forward on crooked legs of lightning. 
As King Rhodar and the others moved out to meet the approaching Mallorean army, Polgara, her face pale and her hair tossing behind her in the wind, climbed the grassy bank with Ce'Nedra and Durnik behind her and stood watching the approach of the cloud. 
Polgara hissed and then raised her voice. She did not seem to be speaking that loudly, but the effect of her words reached the farthest edges of the army. 
Olban jumped forward with his shield raised to protect Ce'Nedra and Errand. 
He winced once as a large hailstone struck his shoulder, but his shield arm did not waver. 
Ce'Nedra looked toward the south bank and saw that the storm there had also dispersed and that the forces under the command of King ChoHag and King Korodullin were assaulting the front ranks of the demoralized Murgo army. 
I tried to save him, but he went under before I could reach him." 
Polgara's face went absolutely white, and her eyes filled with sudden tears. 
"Take care of him, Durnik," she told the smith, then turned and walked away, her head bowed in her grief. I tried, Durnik," Rundorig blurted, still sobbing. 
Durnik's face was very grave as he put his arm about the weeping boy's shoulders. 
Ce'Nedra, however, could not weep. 
My Queen?" Olban gaped at her. 
He held out his gnarled, lumpy hand to her. 
The tendrils of fog had begun to thicken, lying in little pockets now. 
Wind, Pol," Beldin said, taking hold of her hand. 
"As much wind as you can raise." 
His ugly face streamed with rivulets of sweat as he struggled with the vast inertness of unmoving air. 
The Hierarchs of Rak Cthol are riding with Taur Urgas," the hunchback replied. "The twins have their hands full dealing with them. They won't be able to help." 
It was only momentary, and she thought at first that she had imagined it. 
Polgara groaned then, an almost strangled sound, and the fog began to swirl. 
Lelldorin stared into the fog, nervously fingering his bowstring. 
A breeze," someone exulted. 
The phrase raced through the massed army. 
And then Sir Mandorallen's brazen horn sounded its mighty challenge, the ranks of archers and infantry opened, and the earth shook beneath the thunder of the charge of the Mimbrate knights. 
Help me!" Lelldorin cried to a group of serfs standing nearby. 
They were quickly dipped in tar barrels and then hastily wrapped in napthasoaked rags. Then they were placed in the baskets of the waiting engines. 
The catapult master was squinting at a line of notches chipped into the railing in front of his engines. Over his head he held a long white baton and he indicated direction by pointing it either to the right or the left. 
The rags wrapped around the pots leaped into flame as they were touched by waiting torches. 
"Malloreans don't appear to be any brighter than Murgos. 
"you know what I think, Anheg? 
"He's the one who could have stopped Ce'Nedra cold if I'd given him the chance. 
I hope Rhodar can see that." The King of Cherek frowned. 
The fog was nearly gone now, and only a filmy haze remained. 
I'd let them get a little closer," ChoHag advised in his quiet voice as he and Korodullin watched the veritable sea of Murgos advancing against the emplaced ranks of Drasnian pikemen and Tolnedran legionnaires. 
Art thou sure of thy strategy, ChoHag?" the young Arendish King asked with a worried frown. 
"I have a vast ignorance of unmounted combat." 
Oh, I don't know," ChoHag replied with a straight face. 
Do you know what his last words were?" 
He said, 'At least I had a good breakfast.' 
I've seen her do things that looked a lot harder." 
Really?" Beldin replied with heavy sarcasm. "I'm so glad you told me. 
The twisted little man straightened, shook himself like a dog coming out of water and looked around, his face bleak. 
"Let's go, my children!" ChoHag shouted and drove his horse directly at the Murgos in the valley. 
"Let him come!" he grated. 
The startled members of his personal guard stared at him. 
And the Murgo troops melted out of ChoHag's path. 
Today is your last day, ChoHag." 
It was not a duel, for there were proprieties in a duel. The two kings hacked at each other with an elemental brutality, thousands of years of pentup hatred boiling in their blood. 
With a steely rasp, his sabre ran through the Murgo's bloodred mail and through the tensed body, to emerge dripping from his back. Unaware in his madness that he had just received a mortal wound, Taur Urgas raised his sword again, but the strength drained from his arms and the sword fell from his grasp. With stunned disbelief, he gaped at the sabre emerging from his chest, and a bloody froth burst from his mouth. 
Dark blood suddenly spurted from the open mouth of the Murgo King, and he toppled weakly from his saddle. 
I'm sure you understand." 
"Come back and fight, ChoHag!" he gasped weakly. The last that ChoHag saw of him, the dying King of Cthol Murgos was biting at the sod and clawing at the earth with trembling fingers. 
Upon a sharp, barked command, the legionnaires turned their shields slightly and each man thrust his lance out through the opening between his shield and the next. 
That's why I'm saving the Mimbrates," Rhodar replied. 
"They're resting their horses now for one last charge. 
Each such decision wrung Ariana's heart, and she worked with tears standing in her eyes. 
A single glance, however, told the blond girl that the wound in Olban's chest was mortal. 
Olban coughed again, and a bloody froth came to his lips. 
"It was his. 
Belgarion's the Rivan King. 
He seemed so puffedup with his own importanceas if he really was a king instead of just a common Sendarian scullion. 
I thought that if I stayed away from him, he'd never find out that I was the one who'd tried to kill him. 
Doesn't that count for anything?" 
General Varana, however, was staring at the riverbank upstream. 
He went to help his friend, the Baron of Vo Ebor, and a Murgo hit him in the head with a mace. 
They're all good in a fight, and they all have limited understanding." 
The princess almost sobbed with relief. 
Durnik's with you? Good. 
Now listen, and listen carefully. 
As soon as she's awake, she'll know what to do." Ce'Nedra hesitated. "Is Garion there?" she blurted finally. 
And then his voice was gone. 
Are you sure you know what you're doing? 
Some of those are very dangerous." 
Durnik, his face dubious, handed her a brokenoff arrow. 
When she opened her eyes, however, her look was blank, uncomprehending. 
How clever of you to notice," one of them replied in an accent so guttural that it was almost unintelligible. 
"And we're here, your Highness, to extend to you the invitation of his Imperial Majesty 'Zakath, Emperor of Mallorea. 
Hettar shook his head. "That whole flank's seething with Nadraks." 
"I can't very well attack trenches with cavalry," Hettar pointed out. 
The Algars had moved out to the right flank of the retreating army and were gathering in their characteristic small bands, preparing to charge the Nadraks drawn up on the hills above the river. 
I thought you were playing games." 
"I did it, Rhodar," he exulted. 
His features were regular, even handsome, but his eyes were haunted by a profound melancholy. 
We have very little information about Mallorea and its people," the princess responded. 
Their first loyalty is to Torak; their second to their own hierarchy. 
He looked critically at Ce'Nedra's armor. 
Gethell began to babble incoherently. 
At once, your Imperial Majesty." Gethell's eyes started from his head as the two soldiers dragged him to his feet. 
"What do we do with him after we've flogged him?" 
They'll reason that if I'd do that to you, then what I'll do to them will be infinitely worse. When you recover, encourage them in that belief, because the next time this happens, I'll have made arrangements to have the necessary timber on hand. 
Then I'll make arrangements for the absolute comfort of you and your companions." I hope that this won't offend your Imperial Majesty," Ce'Nedra began bravely, "but one is curious about your plans in regard to our future." 
Then the Emperor of boundless Mallorea rose and approached the divan where Durnik supported Lady Polgara. 
Though it wounds me deeply, I must turn you and your companions over to the Grolims. 
They will deliver you up to Zedar, disciple of Torak in Cthol Mishrak, City of Night, where he will decide your fate." 
THEy REMAINED FOR nearly a week in the Imperial compound as the personal guests of the Emperor 'Zakath, who for some strange reason seemed to take a melancholy pleasure in their company. 
Quarters were provided for them within the labyrinth of silken tents and pavilions that sheltered 'Zakath's household staff, and their every comfort received the personal attention of the Emperor himself. 
The strange, sadeyed man puzzled Princess Ce'Nedra. 
"We had always assumed that he was just a foolish old man doting on his young wife. 
We had never even considered him a possible threat. 
Zakath smiled gently. "you're a devious young woman, Ce'Nedra," he said. yes, your Majesty," she acknowledged. 
He looked at her, his eyes as dead and cold as ice. 
"They're an unpredictable people." 
Belgarath himself is convinced that the time is near at hand." His eyes narrowed slightly. 
"I'd hoped to wait until Polgara had regained her strength before subjecting her to the journey; but if what you say is true, there is little time to waste. 
I believe in my own power. 
With the exception of caretaker detachments, however, the huge camp was empty. 
He gave a few orders to his underpriests. 
From the bow of the ship a gong clanged in iron celebration of the sacrifice. 
The ship set sail immediately. 
At a certain point, the Mallorean captain peered about at the empty sea, swallowed hard, and swung his tiller over for the quick, terrified dash across open water to the east. 
My Queen," he said to Polgara, bowing respectfully. 
The Grolim Archpriests had brought horses with them, and the party was soon mounted and riding away from the sea across a line of low, wooded hills in a generally northeasterly direction. 
From everything I've heard it's a bad sort of place," he told her. 
At first I didn't understand who you really are. 
That's why I tried to keep you from coming along. 
It's a bit hard to say for sure. 
One of the reasons, yes." 
It stretched across the sky as stationary as a range of mountains; as they rode toward it, it loomed higher and higher. That's a very strange cloud," Durnik noted, looking speculatively at the thick curtain of purple ahead. 
When the Angaraks built Cthol Mishrak, Torak put that cloud there to hide the city. 
The Grolim Archpriests had begun to look about with a certain apprehension, and finally Urtag called a halt. 
The smell of decay was everywhere, a damp, rotten stench, and slimy pools of stagnant water lay among the ruins. 
And he turned and led them back into the vaulted chamber beyond. 
The eyes of the mask were closed. 
Behind that eyelid burned the dreadful fire of the eye that was not. 
THE WHISPERING HAD begun almost as soon as Belgarath, Silk, and Garion reached the coast of Mallorea. 
Unlike the land of the Morindim which they had left behind, northernmost Mallorea was a land of rolling hills covered with a toughstemmed, dark green grass. 
A sort of dry overcast had moved in off the Sea of the East, and a stiff breeze, chill and smelling of the polar ice, pressed continually at their backs as they moved south. 
Boring sort of place, isn't it?" Silk observed, looking around at the endless grass and the rounded hills that all looked the same. 
Garion concentrated, trying to hear more. 
He's trying to talk you out of killing him." 
He doesn't know what's going to happen any more than you do, and he's just as frightened of you as you are of him." 
There was an offer of friendshipof a hand outstretched in love. 
Then, very clearly, he saw two figures standing side by side. 
The figure of the man was very tall and very powerful, and the figure of the woman was so familiar that the very sight of her caught at Garion's heart. 
Come to us, Belgarion, and accept our love." 
Did somebody come along and make up a set of rules while I wasn't watching?" 
you know what I mean. 
I got tired of it, so I told him to stop." 
you've just succeeded in announcing our presence to every Grolim within a hundred leagues." 
When the Angaraks built the city, Torak decided that he needed something to guard the surrounding countryside. 
The limbs slapped against their faces as they rode, and Garion raised his arm to ward them off as the three of them plunged on. 
They crested a low ridge and galloped down the far side. 
The deeptoned baying was definitely closer. 
We have you now," it growled, seeming almost to chew on the words as it twisted its muzzle into speech. 
From far back in the sway he could clearly hear the sound of splashing. 
And then there was a brilliant bluewhite flash, and a shattering clap of thunder. 
With a sound nearly as loud as the thunder, they were engulfed in a sudden deluge. 
It's just now getting here." 
Turn east." 
Everything's ready there, so move." 
"Let's go," he said sharply and he led them splashing off through the driving rain to solid ground. 
The little man was still wet and shivering. 
"A shapechange is directed almost entirely inward, so there isn't that much noise involved anyway." He turned to Garion. 
"We're going to do it slowly," he said. 
The changeover was very gradual, and for several moments his face and the wolf's face seemed to coexist in the same place. 
Now you do it," he told Garion with the slight change of expression that is so much a part of the speech of wolves. 
Garion smelled fresh blood as he loped past, and the smell brought a sudden, hot taste to his mouth. 
What now, Grandfather?" Garion asked, his whisper hoarse. 
Who can say that what I have done was not essential to that meeting?" 
I don't think we'll gain anything by wrangling with each other, Polgara," Zedar the Apostate was saying. "We each believe that what we did was right. Neither of us could ever persuade the other to change sides at this point. 
Why don't we just let it go at that?" 
There should be others in there, too," Belgarath answered softly. "Let's make sure before we go bursting in." The iron door in front of them did not fit tightly, and faint light seeped through the cracks around the frame. 
How did they get here?" Silk whispered. 
I took to wandering aboutnot really paying much attention to where I was. 
He seemed to be about two years old at the timeold enough to walk and not much more. 
"you cannot know! 
What he wants, he takesand if he must rip out your soul in the taking, it does not matter to him in the slightest. 
Zedar!" Belgarath roared, yanking at the iron door. 
you fool," he muttered. 
Zedar flinched back from the old sorcerer's awful rage. 
No word could contain his rage. 
Zedar reeled back, but Belgarath was upon him, grappling, pounding at him with his hands. 
Garion could feel flickers of will from one or the other of them; but caught up in emotions so powerful that they erased thought, neither was coherent enough to focus the force within him. 
Do something!" Silk shouted at Garion, but Garion could only stare at him in blank incomprehension. 
And he saw Cthrek Goru, Torak's great black sword. 
Dreadful flashes of the sleeping God's mind assailed Garion, and he saw clearly the terrible subterfuge that lay behind Torak's offer of friendship and love. 
Sword in hand, the Child of Light awaited the moment when the Prophecy would release him to join in deadly struggle with the Dark God. 
She redoubled her efforts, twisting as if trying to free herself from his unseen restraint. "Let me go, old man," she cried. 
Don't do this, Pol. 
"you know as well as I that what one of us does, another cannot undo." 
Zedar's imprisoned inside the rock foreveror until I choose to free him." The old man looked mournfully at Durnik's body. 
The others in the underground crypt seemed to be on the periphery of his attention. 
For him there was only one other in the vaulted chamber, and that other was Kal Torak, his enemy. 
The restless stirring of the drowsing God became more evident. 
Garion's peculiarly multiple awarenessin part his own, in part derived from the Orb, and as ever overlaid by the consciousness which he had always called the dry voice in his mindperceived in that stirnng the pain that lay beneath the maimed God's movements. 
"I am thy fate. 
The hatred and defiance seemed to melt out of her, and a terrible fear came into her face. Thy will crumbles, my beloved," he told her. 
Help her, " the voice within him said. 
"Die with thy father!" 
Thy fate awaits thee here. 
But suddenly a vast chorus of voices rang down through all the centuries to him, crying out the single word, "No!" 
Do you wish to involve others?" Garion's voice asked. 
Lightning seethed about them, glaring and flickering. 
But, seizing his sword hilt in both hands, Garion raised his burning blade to meet that vast blow. 
His enemy was not trying to kill him, but was striving instead to force him to submit. 
your people fear you, but they do not love you. 
He clawed at his face, ripping away the polished steel mask to reveal the hideously maimed features that had lain beneath. 
For an instant there was absolute silence. 
In that dreadful instant all that existedall that had been, all that was, all that was yet to be was wrenched suddenly into the course of one Prophecy. 
And then, faint at first, the wind began to blow, purging away the rotten stink of the City of Night, and the stars came on again like suddenly reilluminated jewels on the velvety throat of night. 
That's why Durnik had to die." 
"I wish it could have been otherwise, but it was inevitable." 
Then, indistinctly, Garion perceived that a glowing, incandescent figure stood within the center of each column of light. 
Then he turned and pointed at the silent form of Durnik. 
The face of UL became troubled. 
UL sighed. 
"His sacrifice was for thee and for all mankind." 
"This was the best of men." 
"Is that so difficult to say, my daughter?" 
Wouldst thou have us restore this man to thee, my daughter?" Aldur asked then. Her face came up sharply. 
She looked at him helplessly. 
Aunt Pol's power was central to her very being. 
What would she be without it? 
"I will speak with my father and my brothers. 
And he returned to the sorrowful gathering about Torak's bier. 
Among the glowing Gods, however, one angry voice was raised. 
Aren't you forgetting something, Belgarath?" Silk asked diffidently, as if not wanting to intrude. 
Remember the colt in the cave of the Gods?" 
He let his arm fall from about Ce'Nedra's shoulders, and, his sword still in his hand, he walked slowly toward Aunt Pol and Durnik's body. 
He looked once into her eyes as she sat with the dead man's head in her lap, and then he knelt beside the body. 
Errand, smiling now, approached from the other side and also knelt, taking up Durnik's lifeless hand in his. 
Holding the Orb in both hands, Garion reached out and put it against the dead man's chest. 
He was faintly conscious of the fact that the Gods had gathered about in a circle and that they had reached out their arms, palm to palm, forming an unbroken ring. 
Within that circle, a great light began to pulsate, and the Orb, as if in answer, glowed between his hands. 
He could feel the enormous force of the combined wills of the Gods joining with his in the silent struggle, but the barrier would not yield. 
Use the Orbl " the voice commanded. 
He nodded, though his knees almost buckled. 
And then the light grew so intense that Garion could no longer look at it. 
Only the Orb remained, glowing slightly as it lay on the rough stone. 
Errand, once again with that confident look, went to the bier. Standing on his tiptoes, he reached across the block to retrieve the glowing stone. 
Had he and Ce'Nedra been married in some simple, private little ceremony shortly after his meeting with Torak, things might have gone more smoothly. 
Grul the Eldrak hammered at the frozen ground with his ironshod club, bellowing, "Come 'Grat, fight!" and Ce'Nedra was screaming. 
He was standing on the deck of Barak's ship just off the Mallorean coast, listening as King Anheg explained why Barak was chained to the mast. 
Barak had spent the rest of the voyage back to Mishrak ac Thull trying to come up with a tastefully understated way to add that concept to his coat of arms. 
Garion climbed out of his high, canopied bed and went to the window. 
They're a very good army, really, and I raised them all by myself. 
It's going to taste awful," Garion warned his cousin. 
The weeping God no longer wept. It was useless, Garion decided. 
The fire in his fireplace had been banked for the night, and he stirred it up again. Then he sat in the chair in front of it, staring pensively into the dancing flames. 
He wandered for a time through the dim, empty halls of the Citadel, and then, inevitably, his undirected steps led him to Aunt Pol's door. 
you have a very full day ahead of you." 
Probably not," she said, "but that doesn't necessarily mean that it will be a change for the worse." 
Now you're going to have to work things out on your own." 
What? 
you were going to say now that I no longer have any power." 
"Perhaps you'd better run along now, dear," she suggested. 
I can do that myself, Aunt Pol." That's not a good idea, Garion. 
you're a little nervous today, and you don't want to put a razor to your face when your hands are trembling." 
yes, dear, I know. 
His expression of late had been somewhat more foolish than usual, and Ariana's had been, although radiant, just a trifle smug. 
As a result of one of Ce'Nedra's whims, their wedding was going to be followed by a grand ball, and Lelldorin had been teaching Garion how to dance. 
And she had insincerely fluttered her eyelashes at him. 
Thou art becoming most skilled, your Majesty," Ariana complimented him at the end of the lesson. 
The princess would surely support thee, shouldst thou stumble." 
Will you two stop that?" Garion demanded irritably. 
It's pretty obvious that he's going to strike into southern Cthol Murgos as soon as the ground's firm enough to move an army." 
I always thought Thulls were a stupid people, but you'd be amazed at how creative they can be when it comes to finding new and interesting ways for Grolims to die." 
He did what?" 
He's a civilized man, Garionand a politician. 
There was the usual squabble over the succession by the various sons of Taur Urgas's assorted wives. 
What kind of man is Urgit?" 
The Algars should arrive sometime this morning. 
Mandorallen's perfectly content to suffer nobly." 
There's a great deal of opportunity in the new situation there. I've been in contact with yarblek. 
The money's just a way of keeping score. 
"Perhaps, before we all separate, we should take a moment to remember that we've come a long way since then, and some rather strange things have happened to us. 
Belgarath's eyes were twinkling openly now with some huge, suppressed mirth. 
"I wanted to give you something like that, tooonly I can't work in glass or in gemstones. 
Durnik, however, did not give her the rose yet. 
It was a familiar, rushing surge of whispered sound, filled with a peculiarly belllike shimmer. 
It was unlike any flower that had ever existed. 
"So far as I know, he's the only man who ever died and then lived again. 
But then, I suspect that there's always been a poet lurking under the surface of our good, practical friend. 
Oh, Durnik!" she cried, embracing him. 
As soon as Durnik woke up, I could feel something different in him. 
Why didn't you tell me?" 
No, Pol," he corrected, "you tricked yourself." 
The confrontation between them had been obscure, but he had quite obviously won this time. 
What's so funny?" Garion asked him. 
His face took on a wicked little smirk. 
UL and the other Gods did still love him, even though they knew that he had become twisted and totally evil. 
I was trying not to think about that." 
The blow to his head during the battle of Thull Mardu had affected his hearing, and the young king of Arendia was obviously uncomfortable in company. 
Probably waiting for word that her Highness is ready. 
"I wish it were all over," he said again. 
The hall was hung with buntings and banners, and there was a vast profusion of spring flowers. The wedding guests, in silks, satins, and brightly colored brocades, seemed themselves almost like some flower garden as they twisted and strained to watch the entrance of the royal bridegroom. 
The brazen horns sounded yet another fanfare, and the door at the back of the hall swung wide. 
Garion resented that. 
"We can discuss it later." 
Grinning rather foolishly, Belgarion of Riva turned to face the wedding guests. 
The fragrance of Ce'Nedra's hair, however, continued to work on him, and he noted that his hands trembled visibly as the two of them danced. At the end of the first melody, the wedding guests applauded enthusiastically; as the orchestra took up the second tune, they all joined in, and the floor was filled with whirling colors as the dance became general. 
Garion," she said after a few moments. 
Of course I know." 
Aren't you taking a bit much for granted?" 
That was always my mistake." 
And finally Garion danced with his cousin Adara. 
It will be worth the trouble, believe me." 
She appeared unable to speak, but reached out instead gently to touch his face. 
She had reached back, Garion realized, into the dim past, and she led him through the stately measures of a dance she had learned centuries before, during her sojourn with the Wacite Arends. 
There was that word again. 
Belgarath the Sorcerer was in a whimsical mood as he wandered about the deserted halls of the Rivan Citadel with a tankard in his hand. 
"Well, old friend," he said, squinting up at the Orb, "I see they've all gone off and left you alone too." 
Then he went back up the broad aisle. 
Their behavior can come only from the inspiration of God, the Ruler of all living things: 
In his book, Mutual Aid: A Factor in Evolution, the evolutionist Peter Kropotkin writes about the support that animals give to one another, citing the error that Darwin and his followers fell into: 
These facts about the natural world completely invalidate evolutionists' claim that nature is an arena of selfinterested struggle, where the individual who best protects his own interests comes out on top. 
This intentionally deceptive claim rests on no other foundation besides evolutionists' imagination. 
Gordon R. Taylor labels "pathetic" the claim that behavior patters are inherited by subsequent generations: 
When their young are in danger, mother animals behave differently than usual. 
Why do these animals put their own lives in danger to protect their young? 
Because of this cooperative system of "babysitting," other mother giraffes can leave their babies and go kilometers away in search of food.10 
The way animals live in the natural world clearly invalidates the basic claim of this theory. 
It cannot explain why a zebra that had run away to safety from its enemies returns at the risk of its own life and rescues other zebras surrounded by those enemies. 
The instances of mutual support and intelligent strategy in every species clearly demonstrate God's dominion over living creatures. 
All the abilities they possess, as well as their intelligent behavior, are taught to them by God, the Creator of all, Who teaches them and shows them how to use their abilities. In His endless compassion and mercy, He protects and looks after all His creatures. 
Because they are fed constantly for a certain length of time, they grow quickly. 
In the regions where seals live, spring temperatures seldom reach5? 
How many creatures do not carry their provision with them! God provides for them and He will for you. 
Because of this special construction design, heat is retained.18 
The females of the musk ox, which lives in Alaska, northern Canada and Greenland, give birth to their young in May. Within one hour after its birth, baby musk oxen can stand up and follow their mothers around. 
All mammal babies spend a period of time in their mother's womb, and when they come into the world, not all are fully developed. A newborn kangaroo is no bigger than a bean, and its legs have only just begun to develop. 
This extraordinary production is due to the wonder in God's creation of the kangaroos: 
That is easy for God. (Qur'an, 35:11) 
Like all other animals, raccoons are under God's protection. 
Because of the deadleaf color of its fur and the spotted designs it is virtually invisible in its underbrush environment. 
These features and behavior are inspired in it by Almighty God, Who knows all creatures' needs and protects them: 
When baby mountain goats are born, they can hear and see. 
Our Lord protects and looks after all His creatures; it is He Who inspires the hummingbird with intelligent forethought to build nests that can stretch and expand; and gives other species a sense of responsibility toward its young. 
Ducks, like all water birds, have hollow bones—one reason why they are able to float on the water. 
In addition, often they change their direction when flying to avoid falling prey to wild animals. 
Biological altruism, defined as genetically "selfdestructive behaviour performed for the benefit of others," is incompatible with Darwinism.28 
The parents make a soft murmur, but when in danger or trouble, the babies make a more highpitched sound to which the parents immediately respond. 
Dolphins protect their young from the moment they are born. 
These helpers swim on either side of the mother dolphin to protect her and, when the baby is born, make sure that it gets up to the water's surface to take its first breath. 
Typically the shark gives up, but dolphins have sometimes even killed sharks in this way.32 
Seahorses live on warm ocean reefs where they can hide among the seaweed, coral and sponges. 
In this way, science confirmed the fact that God created the universe and the living things in it. 
For example, in a deer herd under the threat of attack by wild animals, those that can run faster will survive. 
The point emerges that if we examine the fossil record in detail, whether at the level of orders or of species, we find—over and over again—not gradual evolution, but the sudden explosion of one group at the expense of another.48 
According to this completely imaginary scenario, four basic "categories" are listed: 1. Australopithecus 
No matter what treatments it undergoes, this atomic heap cannot form even a single living being. 
Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a threedimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. 
The results of these efforts are sound recorders, highfidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. 
Anyone who does not look at the origin of living beings with a materialist prejudice will see this evident truth: All living beings are works of a Creator, Who is AllPowerful, AllWise, and AllKnowing. 
This Creator is God, Who created the whole universe from nonexistence, designed it in the most perfect form, and fashioned all living beings. 
Anyone free of prejudice and the influence of any particular ideology, who uses only his or her reason and logic, will clearly understand that belief in the theory of evolution, which brings to mind the superstitions of societies with no knowledge of science or civilization, is quite impossible. 
They produced an extremely powerful magic. (Qur'an, 7:116)

But what conclusion have they come to? 
When on the evening that he arrived home he informed the bailiff of his plans, the latter with visible pleasure agreed with what he said so long as he was pointing out that all that had been done up to that time was stupid and useless. 
They were firmly convinced that his real aim (whatever he might say to them) would always be in what he did not say to them. 
Well, I am going away the day after tomorrow, Agafea Mihalovna; I must finish my work. 
But on this occasion she entirely misinterpreted what he had said. 
He even referred to Sergey Ivanovitch without rancor. 
You know I got rid of that woman. 
He sat on his bed in the darkness, crouched up, hugging his knees, and holding his breath from the strain of thought, he pondered. 
Yes, there were gray hairs about his temples. 
What do I know about it? 
Vronsky, against his own will or wishes, followed her lead, hoped too that something, apart from his own action, would be sure to solve all difficulties. 
Vronsky was of distinguished appearance; he possessed, moreover, the art of behaving with respectful dignity, and was used to having to do with such grand personagesthat was how he came to be put in charge of the prince. 
And on his own account he was anxious to enjoy to the utmost all Russian forms of amusement. 
Vronsky had that winter got his promotion, was now a colonel, had left the regimental quarters, and was living alone. 
This morning Liza came to see methey're not afraid to call on me, in spite of the Countess Lidia Ivanovna, she put inand she told me about your Athenian evening. 
I don't understand him in the least, said Vronsky. 
I wouldn't have said, 'Anna, ma chere'! 
I shall die; and I'm very glad I shall die, and release myself and you. 
And I began asking myself what it meant. 
But don't let's talk of it. 
Ring the bell, I'll have tea. 
He did not sleep the whole night, and his fury, growing in a sort of vast, arithmetical progression, reached its highest limits in the morning. 
They're not here, she said, shutting the drawer; but from that action he saw he had guessed right, and roughly pushing away her hand, he quickly snatched a portfolio in which he knew she used to put her most important papers. 
Anna cried, in a rush of hatred, and getting up, she was going away. 
Yes, you only think of yourself! 
Alexey Alexandrovitch was speaking so quickly that he stammered, and was utterly unable to articulate the word suffering. 
And for the first time, for an instant, she felt for him, put herself in his place, and was sorry for him. 
One of the clerks, without getting up, turned wrathfully to Alexey Alexandrovitch, half closing his eyes. What are you wanting? He replied that he had to see the lawyer on some business. 
The lawyer was a little, squat, bald man, with a dark, reddish beard, lightcolored long eyebrows, and an overhanging brow. 
I know you and the goodagain he caught a mothwork you are doing, like every Russian, said the lawyer, bowing. 
I have come simply to consult you as a preliminary step. 
I want a divorce, but the form in which it is possible is of great consequence to me. 
Some members, with Stremov at their head, justified their mistake on the ground that they had put faith in the commission of revision, instituted by Alexey Alexandrovitch, and maintained that the report of the commission was rubbish, and simply so much waste paper. Alexey Alexandrovitch, with a following of those who saw the danger of so revolutionary an attitude to official documents, persisted in upholding the statements obtained by the revising commission. 
The lady smiled a kindly smile too, and she too waved her hand to Alexey Alexandrovitch. 
Well, what a shame not to have let us know! 
I shall come round tomorrow! Stepan Arkadyevitch shouted to him. 
Alexey Alexandrovitch got into his carriage, and buried himself in it so as neither to see nor be seen. 
Stepan Arkadyevitch went to the Grand Theater to a rehearsal of the ballet, and gave Masha Tchibisova, a pretty dancinggirl whom he had just taken under his protection, the coral necklace he had promised her the evening before, and behind the scenes in the dim daylight of the theater, managed to kiss her pretty little face, radiant over her present. 
From the theater Stepan Arkadyevitch drove to Ohotny Row, selected himself the fish and asparagus for dinner, and by twelve o'clock was at Dussot's, where he had to see three people, luckily all staying at the same hotel: Levin, who had recently come back from abroad and was staying there; the new head of his department, who had just been promoted to that position, and had come on a tour of revision to Moscow; and his brotherinlaw, Karenin, whom he must see, so as to be sure of bringing him to dinner. 
And find out whether Count Anitchkin (this was the new head) is receiving. 
Oh, I stayed in Germany, in Prussia, in France, and in Englandnot in the capitals, but in the manufacturing towns, and saw a great deal that was new to me. 
In Russia the question is that of the relation of the working people to the land; though the question exists there toobut there it's a matter of repairing what's been ruined, while with us... 
Shtcherbatsky told me another storyhe met youthat you were in such a depressed state, talking of nothing but death.... 
Well, what of it? 
He had two pieces of business before him that morning; first, to receive and send on a deputation from the native tribes which was on its way to Petersburg, and now at Moscow; secondly, to write the promised letter to the lawyer. 
Come in! he said aloud, collecting his papers, and putting them in the blottingpaper. 
Because I am beginning an action for divorce against your sister, my wife. 
Alexey Alexandrovitch sat down, feeling that his words had not had the effect he anticipated, and that it would be unavoidable for him to explain his position, and that, whatever explanations he might make, his relations with his brotherinlaw would remain unchanged. Yes, I am brought to the painful necessity of seeking a divorce, he said. 
I know you for an excellent, upright man; I know Annaexcuse me, I can't change my opinion of herfor a good, an excellent woman; and so, excuse me, I cannot believe it. 
You must not, you must not act in haste! 
I don't know. 
I imagine our relations must change. 
Allow me to believe that apart from our connection you have for me, at least in part, the same friendly feeling I have always had for you...and sincere esteem, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pressing his hand. 
And it's a wonder he didn't know it. 
At five o'clock, and not evening dress, please, he shouted once more, turning at the door. 
They were just going in at the door, talking of the weather, when Stepan Arkadyevitch overtook them. 
Stepan Arkadyevitch saw by his face that he had come simply to keep his promise, and was performing a disagreeable duty in being present at this gathering. 
What if Darya Alexandrovna told the truth? 
I saw you when you were driving from the railway station to Ergushovo. 
Let me introduce you. He mentioned their names. 
Koznishev admitted both points, but with limitations. As they were going out of the drawing room to conclude the argument, Koznishev said, smiling: So, then, for the Russification of our foreign populations there is but one methodto bring up as many children as one can. 
You have killed a bear, I've been told! said Kitty, trying assiduously to catch with her fork a perverse mushroom that would slip away, and setting the lace quivering over her white arm. 
It was coming back from there that I met your beaufrere in the train, or your beaufrere's brotherinlaw, he said with a smile. 
Quite without attracting notice, without glancing at them, as though there were no other places left, Stepan Arkadyevitch put Levin and Kitty side by side. 
But now we know that these little pills of classical learning possess the medicinal property of antinihilism, and we boldly prescribe them to our patients.... 
Woman is deprived of rights from lack of education, and the lack of education results from the absence of rights. 
When they rose from the table and the ladies had gone out, Pestsov did not follow them, but addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch, began to expound the chief ground of inequality. 
I don't, I don't believe it! Dolly said, trying to catch his glance that avoided her. 
She has forsaken her duty, and deceived her husband. 
There is nothing else for me to do. 
One must get out of the humiliating position in which one is placed; one can't live a trois. 
What can I do? said Alexey Alexandrovitch, raising his shoulders and his eyebrows. 
The recollection of his wife's last act had so incensed him that he had become frigid, as at the beginning of the conversation. 
When Kitty had gone and Levin was left alone, he felt such uneasiness without her and such an impatient longing to get as quickly, as quickly as possible, to tomorrow morning, when he would see her again and be plighted to her forever, that he felt afraid, as though of death, of those fourteen hours that he had to get through without her. 
You don't mind?it's so stifling. 
Of course it is. 
Most delighted, he said, and asked after his wife and sisterinlaw. 
It appeared that Yegor had a family, three boys and a daughter, a sempstress, whom he wanted to marry to a cashier in a saddler's shop. 
He would have talked with him, and tried to comfort him, but remembering that he had nothing but his shirt on, he changed his mind and sat down again at the open pane to bathe in the cold air and gaze at the exquisite lines of the cross, silent, but full of meaning for him, and the mounting lurid yellow star. 
Levin would have entered into conversation with him, but a bell rang for the servant, and he went out. 
All that night and morning Levin lived perfectly unconsciously, and felt perfectly lifted out of the conditions of material life. 
She stopped still close to him, touching him. 
He put his arms round her and pressed his lips to her mouth that sought his kiss. 
But he had not realized what an effect it would have on her, he had not put himself in her place. 
No, it was better anyway, she added, touched by his despairing face. 
I am dying; I beg, I implore you to come. 
Very ill, he answered. 
Alexey Alexandrovitch noticed it and asked: Who is here? 
He jumped up at the doctor's voice, took his hands from his face, and saw Alexey Alexandrovitch. 
I am entirely in your power, only let me be here...though I am at your disposal. 
No one knows him. 
The nervous agitation of Alexey Alexandrovitch kept increasing, and had by now reached such a point that he ceased to struggle with it. 
She put her arm around his head, moved towards him, and with defiant pride lifted up her eyes. 
Alexey Alexandrovitch, do uncover his face! I want to see him. 
I won't conceal from you that in beginning this I was in uncertainty, I was in misery; I will confess that I was pursued by a desire to revenge myself on you and on her. 
Tears stood in his eyes, and the luminous, serene look in them impressed Vronsky. 
If she wishes to see you, I will let you know, but now I suppose it would be better for you to go away. 
A sledge, sir? asked the porter. 
Again in extraordinarily rapid succession his best moments rose before his mind, and then his recent humiliation. 
Am I going out of my mind? he said to himself. 
He moved the cushion up, and pressed his head into it, but he had to make an effort to keep his eyes shut. 
He got up from the sofa, took off his coat, undid his belt, and uncovering his hairy chest to breathe more freely, walked up and down the room. 
This is how people go mad, he repeated, and how they shoot themselves...to escape humiliation, he added slowly. 
Missed! he said, fumbling after the revolver. 
He felt more for his son than before. 
The doctor said it was nothing serious, and he ordered a bath, sir. 
They gave the baby medicine, and it turned out that the baby was simply hungry: the nurse had no milk, sir. 
The nurse, with a gesture of despair, went to it, took it from the wetnurse's arms, and began walking up and down, rocking it. 
Betsy's been telling me that Count Vronsky wants to come here to say goodbye before his departure for Tashkend. 
I am an outsider, but I so love her and respect you that I venture to advise. 
He said this from habit, lifting his brows with dignity, and reflected immediately that whatever his words might be, there could be no dignity in his position. 
Her only desire now was to be rid of his oppressive presence. 
And going back into the drawing room, they stood in a corner. 
After accompanying Betsy to the outside hall, once more kissing her hand above the glove, at the point where the pulse beats, and murmuring to her such unseemly nonsense that she did not know whether to laugh or be angry, Stepan Arkadyevitch went to his sister. 
You are ill and overwrought, he said; believe me, you're exaggerating dreadfully. 
But I repeat, it's an accomplished fact. 
I feel I'm lying head downwards in a sort of pit, but I ought not to save myself. 
This feeling was so unexpected and so strange that he did not believe it was the voice of conscience telling him that what he was meaning to do was wrong. 
Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled mournfully, looked at his brotherinlaw, and without answering went up to the table, took from it an unfinished letter, and handed it to his brotherinlaw. 
His kindly smile was so winning that Alexey Alexandrovitch, feeling his own weakness and unconsciously swayed by it, was ready to believe what Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying. 
To leave him with his mother was out of the question. 
If she were divorced, he knew she would join her life to Vronsky's, and their tie would be an illegitimate and criminal one, since a wife, by the interpretation of the ecclesiastical law, could not marry while her husband was living. 
The only question is on what terms you agree to give her a divorce. 
There was bitterness, there was shame in his heart, but with bitterness and shame he felt joy and emotion at the height of his own meekness. 
Stepan Arkadyevitch was touched. 
This is an unhappy fatality, and one must accept it as such. 
The first time he was able to speak, Varya, his brother's wife, was alone in the room. 
When she had finished he said: I'm not delirious. 
Stepan Arkadyevitch advised him to go abroad. 
He felt incapable of being either. 
They had nothing to talk about, as was almost always the case at this time, and laying her hand on the table she kept opening and shutting it, and laughed herself as she watched her action. 
No, it seems to be beginning again, he thought, listening to the prayers. 
Thought, till then locked up, began to stir in Levin's head, but he made haste to drive it away. 
What are your special sins? he added, without the slightest interval, as though anxious not to waste time. 
I sometimes even have doubts of the existence of God, Levin could not help saying, and he was horrified at the impropriety of what he was saying. 
What sort of doubt can there be of the existence of God? he said hurriedly, with a just perceptible smile. 
Levin felt that it would be improper to enter upon a metaphysical discussion with the priest, and so he said in reply merely what was a direct answer to the question. 
I don't understand it at all, said Levin, blushing, and feeling that his words were stupid, and that they could not be anything but stupid n such a position. 
If you love your child as a good father, you will not desire only wealth, luxury, honor for your infant; you will be anxious for his salvation, his spiritual enlightenment with the light of truth. 
Will you leave him to the allurements of the world and the devil? 
A more determined enemy of matrimony than you I never saw, said Sergey Ivanovitch. 
I'm in favor of division of labor. 
That's how I look at it. 
And the fact is, I certainly do love cuttlefish. 
Do you remember last time at Hapilovo? That was a delightful hunt! said Tchirikov. 
There's some sense in this custom of saying goodbye to bachelor life, said Sergey Ivanovitch. 
However happy you may be, you must regret your freedom. 
What is freedom for? 
I'll go to her; I'll ask her; I'll say for the last time: we are free, and hadn't we better stay so? 
(These latter days she used these names almost alternately.) 
I'm going through my wardrobe to see what's for whom... 
You couldn't consent to marry me. 
Think a little. 
But his face was so piteous, that she restrained her vexation, and flinging some clothes off an armchair, she sat down beside him. 
Altogether there were a great many most complicated matters to be considered and arranged. 
A crowd of people, principally women, was thronging round the church lighted up for the wedding. 
You're a nice person! she said to Levin. 
The priest was the same old man that had confessed Levin. 
Looking down at her he saw her face in profile, and from the scarcely perceptible quiver of her lips and eyelashes he knew she was aware of his eyes upon her. 
Those six weeks had for her been a time of the utmost bliss and the utmost misery. 
It will make no difference, said Madame Lvova; we're all obedient wives; it's in our family. 
They enjoyed hearing the epistle read, and the roll of the head deacon's voice at the last verse, awaited with such impatience by the outside public. 
He smiled his kindly smile and said gently, Kiss your wife, and you kiss your husband, and took the candles out of their hands. 
It was only when their wondering and timid eyes met that he believed in it, because he felt that they were one. 
In the corps Golenishtchev had belonged to the liberal party; he left the corps without entering the army, and had never taken office under the government. 
Come, tell me what you're doing. 
I've been living here for two years. 
Vronsky at once divined that Golenishtchev was of this class, and therefore was doubly pleased to see him. 
He fancied that he understood what she was utterly unable to understand: how it was that, having made her husband wretched, having abandoned him and her son and lost her good name, she yet felt full of spirits, gaiety, and happiness. It's in the guidebook, said Golenishtchev, referring to the palazzo Vronsky had taken. 
I tell you what: it's a lovely day, let's go and have another look at it, said Vronsky, addressing Anna. 
Golenishtchev recovered himself with an effort, and at first was dejected and gloomy, but Anna, disposed to feel friendly with everyone as she was at that time, soon revived his spirits by her direct and lively manner. 
He has great talent, said Anna with a delighted smile. 
The thought of the harm caused to her husband aroused in her a feeling like repulsion, and akin to what a drowning man might feel who has shaken off another man clinging to him. 
It was an evil action, of course, but it was the sole means of escape, and better not to brood over these fearful facts. 
Her complete ownership of him was a continual joy to her. 
But she could not help being grateful to him for his attitude to her, and showing that she appreciated it. 
Vronsky, meanwhile, in spite of the complete realization of what he had so long desired, was not perfectly happy. 
As for the amusements of bachelor existence, which had provided Vronsky with entertainment on previous tours abroad, they could not be thought of, since the sole attempt of the sort had led to a sudden attack of depression in Anna, quite out of proportion with the causea late supper with bachelor friends. 
Christ before Pilate. 
But I believe he doesn't care about painting any more portraits, and so very likely he is in want. 
Vronsky, too, glanced out of the window and into Anna's eyes, and, turning at once to Golenishtchev, he said: Do you know this Mihailov? 
In former days, said Golenishtchev, not observing, or not willing to observe, that both Anna and Vronsky wanted to speak, in former days the freethinker was a man who had been brought up in ideas of religion, law, and morality, and only through conflict and struggle came to freethought; but now there has sprung up a new type of born freethinkers who grow up without even having heard of principles of morality or of religion, of the existence of authorities, who grow up directly in ideas of negation in everything, that is to say, savages. 
You're fool enough at all times, and when you start explaining things in Italian you're a fool three times as foolish, he said after a long dispute. 
Thickset and of middle height, with nimble movements, with his brown hat, olivegreen coat and narrow trousersthough wide trousers had been a long while in fashion,most of all, with the ordinariness of his broad face, and the combined expression of timidity and anxiety to keep up his dignity, Mihailov made an unpleasant impression. 
It was all common, poor, and stale, and positively badly paintedweak and unequal. 
They would be justified in repeating hypocritically civil speeches in the presence of the painter, and pitying him and laughing at him when they were alone again. 
The silence (though it lasted no more than a minute) became too intolerable to him. 
Golenishtchev answered easily, removing his eyes without the slightest regret from the picture and turning to the artist. 
Mihailov fancied that the picture had made an impression on them too. 
Your picture is so fine that my observation cannot detract from it, and, besides, it is only my personal opinion. 
And before the picture of Ivanov the question arises for the believer and the unbeliever alike, 'Is it God, or is it not God?' and the unity of the impression is destroyed. 
The enthusiasm over this picture stirred some of the old feeling for it in Mihailov, but he feared and disliked this waste of feeling for things past, and so, even though this praise was grateful to him, he tried to draw his visitors away to a third picture. 
On the day fixed he came and began the work. 
He was unmistakably bored by Golenishtchev's conversation, and he did not attempt to oppose him. 
Levin had been married three months. 
I'll never go anywhere, especially not to Moscow. 
No, no, go along, go on writing; don't break off, she said, pursing up her lips, and I must cut out these little holes now, do you see? 
Oh! what was I thinking about? 
Why should I, of all people, have such happiness! 
You see, your good lady's settled me here, told me to sit a bit with her, said Agafea Mihalovna, smiling affectionately at Kitty. 
He saw that, in spite of Agafea Mihalovna's feelings being hurt by a new mistress taking the reins of government out of her hands, Kitty had yet conquered her and made her love her. 
It's always of you he has talked, and, besides, he has no more money left. 
Read this; Dolly writes about you, Kitty was beginning, with a smile; but she stopped suddenly, noticing the changed expression on her husband's face. 
When are you going? she said. 
I'm going because my brother is dying, said Levin. 
I tell you, that if you go, I shall come with you; I shall certainly come, she said hastily and wrathfully. 
Not at all. 
Nikolay Dmitrievitch will be delighted. 
For the first instant Levin saw an expression of eager curiosity in the eyes with which Kitty looked at this awful woman, so incomprehensible to her; but it lasted only a single instant. 
He had expected to find him in the same state of selfdeception which he had heard was so frequent with the consumptive, and which had struck him so much during his brother's visit in the autumn. 
A silence followed. Suddenly Nikolay stirred, and began to say something. 
Very well, and I'll tell her to tidy up here. 
There I might be a help to you and to him. 
Levin was obliged to agree, and regaining his composure, and completely forgetting about Marya Nikolaevna by now, he went again in to his brother with Kitty. 
The next day the sick man received the sacrament and extreme unction. 
He even raised himself when his soup was brought, and asked for a cutlet as well. 
This selfdeception was not of long duration. 
Levin gave him the bottle, and the same look of passionate hope with which he had taken the sacrament was now fastened on his brother, demanding from him the confirmation of the doctor's words that inhaling iodine worked wonders. 
It was for her sake I went through that farce. 
It's the end. 
Wait a little. 
Levin got up to stop her. 
Only at rare moments, when the opium gave him an instant's relief from the neverceasing pain, he would sometimes, half asleep, utter what was ever more intense in his heart than in all the others: Oh, if it were only the end! or: When will it be over? 
Even when his brother or Kitty bent over him, so that he could see them, he looked just the same. 
It was only when Anna had left his house, and the English governess sent to ask him whether she should dine with him or separately, that for the first time he clearly comprehended his position, and was appalled by it. 
If his wife had then, on declaring to him her unfaithfulness, left him, he would have been wounded, unhappy, but he would not have been in the hopeless positionincomprehensible to himselfin which he felt himself now. 
He gave orders for the carriage that was awaiting him to be taken back, and for no one to be admitted, and he did not go down to dinner. 
There were two brothers. 
Of the people in Petersburg the most intimate and most possible were his chief secretary and his doctor. 
After signing the papers brought him, Alexey Alexandrovitch had sat for a long while in silence, glancing at Mihail Vassilievitch, and several times he attempted to speak, but could not. 
Alexey Alexandrovitch knitted his brows, and crooking his hands, he cracked his fingers. 
One must know all the facts, he said in his thin voice. 
I will be your housekeeper. 
But, dear friend, do not give way to the feeling of which you spokebeing ashamed of what is the Christian's highest glory: he who humbles himself shall be exalted. 
She did actually take upon herself the care of the organization and management of Alexey Alexandrovitch's household. 
All her arrangements had to be modified because they could not be carried out, and they were modified by Korney, Alexey Alexandrovitch's valet, who, though no one was aware of the fact, now managed Karenin's household, and quietly and discreetly reported to his master while he was dressing all it was necessary for him to know. 
Two months after marriage her husband abandoned her, and her impassioned protestations of affection he met with a sarcasm and even hostility that people knowing the count's good heart, and seeing no defects in the sentimental Lidia, were at loss to explain. 
Alexey Alexandrovitch must be saved from seeing her, he must be saved even from the torturing knowledge that that awful woman was in the same town with him, and that he might meet her any minute. 
Alexey Alexandrovitch! said the little old man, with a malicious light in his eyes, at the moment when Karenin was on a level with them, and was nodding with a frigid gesture, I haven't congratulated you yet, said the old man, pointing to his newly received ribbon. 
As I have mentioned to you, there's a sort of coldness in him towards the most important questions which ought to touch the heart of every man and every child.... 
You're coming to me, said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, after a pause; we have to speak of a subject painful for you. 
A cloth was laid on a round table, and on it stood a china tea service and a silver spiritlamp and tea kettle. 
Well now, we can sit quietly, said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, slipping hurriedly with an agitated smile between the table and the sofa, and talk over our tea. 
But this temptation did not last long, and soon there was reestablished once more in Alexey Alexandrovitch's soul the peace and the elevation by virtue of which he could forget what he did not want to remember. 
The hall porter nodded his head affirmatively. 
People have been already to congratulate him. 
They've their lessons to learn too. 
And higher still? 
But why have they all agreed to speak just in the same manner always the dreariest and most useless stuff? 
Why does he keep me off; why doesn't he love me? he asked himself mournfully, and could not think of an answer. 
Later, when he accidentally learned from his old nurse that his mother was not dead, and his father and Lidia Ivanovna had explained to him that she was dead to him because she was wicked (which he could not possibly believe, because he loved her), he went on seeking her and expecting her in the same way. 
The lady had not come up to them, but had disappeared somewhere. 
On the contrary, he was far cleverer than the boys his teacher held up as examples to Seryozha. 
His mother and sisterinlaw greeted him as usual: they asked him about his stay abroad, and talked of their common acquaintances, but did not let drop a single word in allusion to his connection with Anna. 
But he very quickly perceived that though the world was open for him personally, it was closed for Anna. 
How about the divorce? 
Alexey! don't be angry with me. Please understand that I'm not to blame, began Varya, looking at him with a timid smile. 
Vronsky knew that further efforts were useless, and that he had to spend these few days in Petersburg as though in a strange town, avoiding every sort of relation with his own old circle in order not to be exposed to the annoyances and humiliations which were so intolerable to him. 
To go straight to the house, where she might meet Alexey Alexandrovitch, that she felt she had no right to do. 
Her suffering was the more poignant that she had to bear it in solitude. 
She had prepared everything but the words she should say to her son. 
Some lady, said Kapitonitch, who, not yet dressed, in his overcoat and galoshes, had peeped out of the window and seen a lady in a veil standing close up to the door. 
Please walk in, your excellency, he said to her. 
When she was parted from him, and all this latter time when she had been feeling a fresh rush of love for him, she had pictured him as he was at four years old, when she had loved him most of all. 
It was as though only now, on seeing her smile, he fully grasped what had happened. 
I don't want that on, he said, taking off her hat. 
Meanwhile Vassily Lukitch had not at first understood who this lady was, and had learned from their conversation that it was no other person than the mother who had left her husband, and whom he had not seen, as he had entered the house after her departure. He was in doubt whether to go in or not, or whether to communicate with Alexey Alexandrovitch. 
But the embraces of the mother and child, the sound of their voices, and what they were saying, made him change his mind. 
Among the servants of the household there was intense excitement all this time. 
I came for the birthday, Anna Arkadyevna, darling! 
She went up to him. 
At the other door there was the sound of steps, and the nurse in a scared whisper said, He's coming, and gave Anna her hat. 
On getting back to her lonely rooms in the hotel she could not for a long while understand why she was there. 
Fixing her eyes on a bronze clock standing on a table between the windows, she tried to think. 
The French maid brought from abroad came in to suggest she should dress. She gazed at her wonderingly and said, Presently. A footman offered her coffee. 
Having talked a little while, and noticing that Vronsky glanced at the clock, Yashvin asked her whether she would be staying much longer in Petersburg, and unbending his huge figure reached after his cap. 
Alexey, you have not changed to me? she said, pressing his hand in both of hers. 
And so am I. You're going, no doubt, to hear Patti? said Tushkevitch. 
Are you really going to the theater? he said, trying not to look at her. 
Why do you ask with such alarm? she said, wounded again at his not looking at her. 
Oh, of course, there's no reason whatever, he said, frowning. 
Princess Varvara has gone to dress, she is going with me. He shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity and despair. 
Do I regret what I have done? 
For us, for you and for me, there is only one thing that matters, whether we love each other. 
But how can she fail to see it, and what is going on in her? he said to himself. 
You were talking of Lankovsky's Powerful. That's a fine horse, and I would advise you to buy him, said Yashvin, glancing at his comrade's gloomy face. 
If you do, come to the stalls; you can take Kruzin's stall, added Yashvin as he went out. 
Vronsky, left alone, got up from his chair and began pacing up and down the room. 
A diplomat, an artist, something of that sort, one would say. 
What a pity you were not in time for the first act! 
She was sitting in front, and slightly turning, was saying something to Yashvin. 
When Vronsky turned the opera glass again in that direction, he noticed that Princess Varvara was particularly red, and kept laughing unnaturally and looking round at the next box. 
Scowling, he sucked the left end of his mustache further and further into his mouth, and cast sidelong glances at the next box. 
Purposely choosing the way round furthest from Anna's box, he jostled as he came out against the colonel of his old regiment talking to two acquaintances. 
Madame Karenina... she began. But what is it? I don't know. 
Let's go together. 
With rapid steps he went downstairs; he felt that he must do something, but he did not know what. 
Unpleasant! she criedhideous! 
Darya Alexandrovna spent the summer with her children at Pokrovskoe, at her sister Kitty Levin's. 
Money's out of the question! the princess and Kitty exclaimed with one voice. They appreciate a present... 
Something like Varenka's. So pretty and inexpensive. Well, now I think it's done, said Dolly, dropping the syrup from the spoon. 
He (HE meant Sergey Ivanovitch) might at any time have been a match for anyone in Russia; now, of course, he's not quite a young man, still I know ever so many girls would be glad to marry him even now.... 
Mamma, how did papa make you an offer? Kitty asked suddenly. 
You loved him, anyway, before you were allowed to speak? 
Kitty felt a peculiar pleasure in being able now to talk to her mother on equal terms about those questions of such paramount interest in a woman's life. 
That Vronsky paid you attentionsthat happens to every girl. 
No, let me speak, her mother went on, why, you yourself would not let me have a talk to Vronsky. 
I often think of her. 
And I don't want to think of it, she said, catching the sound of her husband's wellknown step on the steps of the terrace. 
Well, are we going for the children? I've ordered the horses to be put in. 
It's not as it was with poor Nikolay...you really cared for each other, Levin finished. 
And you? Kitty asked, with an ironical and loving smile. 
Don't you too work for others? 
But then one must have the simplicity, the straightforwardness, the goodness of your father: and I haven't got that. 
She would owe everything to her husband, which was what he had always desired too for his future family life. 
And this girl, who united all these qualities, loved him. 
Kneeling down, with her hands over the mushrooms to guard them from Grisha, she was calling little Masha. 
That one too, near the twig, she pointed out to little Masha a little fungus, split in half across its rosy cap by the dry grass from under which it thrust itself. 
Varenka got up while Masha picked the fungus, breaking it into two white halves. 
They walked on for some steps in silence. 
And I know why, the princess went on; he says that young people ought to be left alone for a while at first. 
Levin had offered to take her place, but the mother, having once overheard Levin's lesson, and noticing that it was not given exactly as the teacher in Moscow had given it, said resolutely, though with much embarrassment and anxiety not to mortify Levin, that they must keep strictly to the book as the teacher had done, and that she had better undertake it again herself. 
I've been meaning, indeed, to ask you to tell him that it's out of the question for her (she indicated Kitty) to stay here; that she positively must come to Moscow. 
Is ea id, ejus, ejus, ejus! shouted Grisha, skipping along the avenue. 
Papa, of course! cried Levin, stopping at the entrance of the avenue. 
And that was not all. 
Strange as it was to him afterwards to recall it, it seemed to him at the moment clear that in asking whether he was going shooting, all she cared to know was whether he would give that pleasure to Vassenka Veslovsky, with whom, as he fancied, she was in love. 
No, better spend the day here tomorrow, or Dolly won't see anything of her husband, and set off the day after, said Kitty. 
He thinks it's the best possible form, and so I'm obliged to be civil to him. 
Laska flew up to him, welcomed him, and jumping up, asked him in her own way whether the others were coming soon, but getting no answer from him, she returned to her post of observation and sank into repose again, her head on one side, and one ear pricked up to listen. 
Then he had once more to hear her declare that she was not angry with him for going away for two days, and to beg her to be sure to send him a note next morning by a servant on horseback, to write him, if it were but two words only, to let him know that all was well with her. 
Kitty was distressed, as she always was, at parting for a couple of days from her husband, but when she saw his eager figure, looking big and strong in his shootingboots and his white blouse, and a sort of sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to her, she forgot her own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure, and said goodbye to him cheerfully. 
Well, what is it? Would your honor let me make another turning? It's only three steps to add. 
Now the carpenter wanted, keeping the same staircase, to add three steps. It will be much better. 
 the sweat of your brow  no longer serves you! 
 Soon, if this continues,  it will be the course of progress 
 Come listen to my counsel. 
The first magistrates, both in date and in importance, were the King, the Polemarch, and the Archon. 
Others assign it to the time of Acastus, and adduce as proof the fact that the nine Archons swear to execute their oaths has in the days of Acastus,' which seems to suggest that it was in his time that the descendants of Codrus retired from the kingship in return for the prerogatives conferred upon the Archon. 
The Archon lived in the Prytaneum, the Polemarch in the Epilyceum. 
The latter building was formerly called the Polemarcheum, but after Epilycus, during his term of office as Polemarch, had rebuilt it and fitted it up, it was called the Epilyceum. 
In the time of Solon, however, they all came together into the Thesmotheteum. 
Such was, in outline, the first constitution, but not very long after the events above recorded, in the archonship of Aristaichmus, Draco enacted his ordinances. Now his constitution had the following form. 
The Council of Areopagus was guardian of the laws, and kept watch over the magistrates to see that they executed their offices in accordance with the laws. 
At the same time it seems reasonable to suppose that this class, like the Pentacosiomedimni, was defined by the possession of an income of a certain number of measures. 
Hence it is that even at the present day, when a candidate for any office is asked to what class he belongs, no one would think of saying that he belonged to the Thetes. 
There are three points in the constitution of Solon which appear to be its most democratic features: first and most important, the prohibition of loans on the security of the debtor's person; secondly, the right of every person who so willed to claim redress on behalf of any one to whom wrong was being done; thirdly, the institution of the appeal to the jurycourts; and it is to this last, they say, that the masses have owed their strength most of all, since, when the democracy is master of the votingpower, it is master of the constitution. 
He also made weights corresponding with the coinage, sixtythree minas going to the talent; and the odd three minas were distributed among the staters and the other values. 
For had I granted, now what pleased the one, Then what their foes devised in counterpoise, Of many a man this state had been bereft. Therefore I showed my might on every side, Turning at bay like wolf among the hounds. 
For four years, indeed, they lived in peace; but in the fifth year after Solon's government they were unable to elect an Archon on account of their dissensions, and again four years later they elected no Archon for the same reason. 
The parties at this time were three in number. 
The names given to the respective parties were derived from the districts in which they held their lands. 
But when all his words availed nothing he carried forth his armour and set it up in front of his house, saying that he had helped his country so far as lay in his power (he was already a very old man), and that he called on all others to do the same. 
After his victory in the battle at Pallene he captured Athens, and when he had disarmed the people he at last had his tyranny securely established, and was able to take Naxos and set up Lygdamis as ruler there. 
He ordered a parade in full armour in the Theseum, and began to make a speech to the people. 
Then, while he continued to speak to them at great length, men whom he had appointed for the purpose collected the arms and locked them up in the chambers of the Theseum hard by, and came and made a signal to him that it was done. 
In all things he was accustomed to observe the laws, without giving himself any exceptional privileges. 
It is evident from this that the story is mere gossip which states that Pisistratus was the youthful favourite of Solon and commanded in the war against Megara for the recovery of Salamis. 
After the death of Pisistratus his sons took up the government, and conducted it on the same system. 
He had two sons by his first and legitimate wife, Hippias and Hipparchus, and two by his Argive consort, Iophon and Hegesistratus, who was surnamed Thessalus. 
But while they were lying in wait for Hippias in the Acropolis at the time of the Panathenaea (Hippias, at this moment, was awaiting the arrival of the procession, while Hipparchus was organizing its dispatch) they saw one of the persons privy to the plot talking familiarly with him. Thinking that he was betraying them, and desiring to do something before they were arrested, they rushed down and made their attempt without waiting for the rest of their confederates. 
After this disaster the following became a popular drinking song: Ah! Lipsydrium, faithless friend! 
The supremacy of the Areopagus lasted for about seventeen years after the Persian wars, although gradually declining. 
In this way was the Council of Areopagus deprived of its guardianship of the state. 
Pericles followed as leader of the people, and Thucydides, who was connected by marriage with Cimon, of the opposition. 
When the committee was elected, their first proposal was that the Prytanes should be compelled to put to the vote any motion that was offered on behalf of the public safety. 
They were to administer that office as seemed to them best, both with reference to the safe custody and due expenditure of the finances, and generally with regard to all other matters to the best of their ability. 
These five persons were to cast lots for precedence between the parties wishing to appear before the Council, giving the first place to sacred matters, the second to heralds, the third to embassies, and the fourth to all other subjects; but matters concerning the war might be dealt with, on the motion of the generals, whenever there was need, without balloting. 
The hundred commissioners appointed by the Five Thousand drew up the constitution as just stated; and after it had been ratified by the people, under the presidency of Aristomachus, the existing Council, that of the year of Callias, was dissolved before it had completed its term of office. 
Secondly, when the Lacedaemonians proposed to evacuate Decelea and make peace on the basis of the existing position, although some of the Athenians supported this proposal, the majority refused to listen to them. 
Now when winter had set in, Thrasybulus and the exiles occupied Phyle, and the force which the Thirty led out to attack them met with a reverse. Thereupon the Thirty decided to disarm the bulk of the population and to get rid of Theramenes; which they did in the following way. 
The list of those who desired to secede should be made up within ten days after the taking of the oaths in the case of persons already in the country, and their actual departure should take place within twenty days; persons at present out of the country should have the same terms allowed to them after their return. 
When the reconciliation had taken place on these terms, those who had fought on the side of the Thirty felt considerable apprehensions, and a large number intended to secede. 
Not only did they blot out all memory of former offences, but they even repaid to the Lacedaemonians out of the public purse the money which the Thirty had borrowed for the war, although the treaty required each party, the party of the city and the party of Piraeus, to pay its own debts separately. 
This they did because they thought it was a necessary first step in the direction of restoring harmony; but in other states, so far from the democratic parties making advances from their own possessions, they are rather in the habit of making a general redistribution of the land. 
Next, and first after this, having now some semblance of a constitution, was that which took place in the reign of Theseus, consisting in a slight deviation from absolute monarchy. 
The eleventh was that which followed the return from Phyle and Piraeus; and this has continued from that day to this, with continual accretions of power to the masses. 
The democracy has made itself master of everything and administers everything by its votes in the Assembly and by the lawcourts, in which it holds the supreme power. 
Consequently, after the Prytanes had tried many devices in vain in order to induce the populace to come and ratify the votes, Agyrrhius, in the first instance, made a provision of one obol a day, which Heracleides of Clazomenae, nicknamed 'the king', increased to two obols, and Agyrrhius again to three. 
For these two years they are on garrison duty, and wear the military cloak, and during this time they are exempt from all taxes. 
The Prytanes for the time being, in the first place, mess together in the Tholus, and receive a sum of money from the state for their maintenance; and, secondly, they convene the meetings of the Council and the Assembly. 
They also draw up the programme for the meetings of the Assembly. 
One of these in each prytany is called the 'sovereign' Assembly; in this the people have to ratify the continuance of the magistrates in office, if they are performing their duties properly, and to consider the supply of corn and the defence of the country. 
On this day, too, impeachments are introduced by those who wish to do so, the lists of property confiscated by the state are read, and also applications for inheritances and wards of state, so that nothing may pass unclaimed without the cognizance of any person concerned. 
These officers receive the tablets, and strike off the instalments as they are paid, in the presence of the Council in the Councilchamber, and give the tablets back to the public clerk. 
The Council also, speaking broadly, cooperates in most of the duties of all the other magistrates; and this ends the list of the functions of that body. 
There are ten Commissioners for Repairs of Temples, elected by lot, who receive a sum of thirty minas from the ReceiversGeneral, and therewith carry out the most necessary repairs in the temples. 
Their statutory duty is to see that all articles offered for sale in the market are pure and unadulterated. 
It also elects by lot ten others, known as Annual Commissioners, who offer certain sacrifices and administer all the quadrennial festivals except the Panathenaea. 
There are the following quadrennial festivals: first that of Delos (where there is also a sexennial festival), secondly the Brauronia, thirdly the Heracleia, fourthly the Eleusinia, and fifthly the Panathenaea; and no two of these are celebrated in the same place. 
An Archon is also elected by lot for Salamis, and a Demarch for Piraeus. 
The suits and indictments which come before him, and which he, after a preliminary inquiry, brings up before the lawcourts, are as follows. Injury to parents (for bringing these actions the prosecutor cannot suffer any penalty); injury to orphans (these actions lie against their guardians); injury to a ward of state (these lie against their guardians or their husbands), injury to an orphan's estate (these too lie against the guardians); mental derangement, where a party charges another with destroying his own property through unsoundness of mind; for appointment of liquidators, where a party refuses to divide property in which others have a share; for constituting a wardship; for determining between rival claims to a wardship; for granting inspection of property to which another party lays claim; for appointing oneself as guardian; and for determining disputes as to inheritances and wards of state. 
The person who is charged with homicide is at all other times excluded from the temples, nor is it even lawful for him to enter the marketplace; but on the occasion of his trial he enters the temple and makes his defence. 
Moreover they bring up certain private suits in cases of merchandise and mines, or where a slave has slandered a free man. 
It is they also who cast lots to assign the courts to the various magistrates, whether for private or public cases. They ratify commercial treaties, and bring up the cases which arise out of such treaties; and they also bring up cases of perjury from the Areopagus. 
There are also ten Commissioners of Games (Athlothetae), elected by lot, one from each tribe. 
When, then, the Archon has collected the oil for his year of office, he hands it over to the Treasurers to preserve in the Acropolis, and he may not take his seat in the Areopagus until he has paid over to the Treasurers the full amount. 
Their duties are assigned to them by open vote; one is appointed to command the heavy infantry, and leads them if they go out to war; one to the defence of the country, who remains on the defensive, and fights if there is war within the borders of the country; two to Piraeus, one of whom is assigned to Munichia, and one to the south shore, and these have charge of the defence of the Piraeus; and one to superintend the symmories, who nominates the trierarchs arranges exchanges of properties for them, and brings up actions to decide on rival claims in connexion with them. 
There is also a Hipparch for Lemnos, elected by open vote, who has charge of the cavalry in Lemnos. 
First the members of the Assembly receive a drachma for the ordinary meetings, and nine obols for the 'sovereign' meeting. 
The juries for the lawcourts are chosen by lot by the nine Archons, each for their own tribe, and by the clerk to the Thesmothetae for the tenth. 
Then the Archon casts in the dice and thereby chooses the jurors from each tribe, room by room. 
If it is a day for private cases, the private litigants are called. 
Ten gallons are allowed for a case in which an amount of more than five thousand drachmas is involved, and three for the second speech on each side. 
The ballot balls are made of brass with stems running through the centre, half of them having the stem pierced and the other half solid. 
Then he proclaims again, 'The pierced ballot for the plaintiff, the solid for the defendant'; and the juror, taking his two ballot balls from the stand, with his hand closed over the stem so as not to show either the pierced or the solid ballot to the litigants, casts the one which is to count into the brazen urn, and the other into the wooden urn. 
Materialism is a creed which maintains that only matter exists, and is equivalent to atheism. 
(Science and Creationism, p.5) 
Just the realization that the primeval Earth's atmosphere contained sufficient quantities of oxygen to tear apart any organic molecules (the establishment of the fact that it was not "reducing" as chemists put it) places the theory of evolution in a most difficult position as regards the origin of life. 
[B]y challenging the assumption of a reducing atmosphere, we challenge the very existence of the "prebiotic soup", with its richness of biologically important organic compounds. 
Take some matter, heat while stirring and wait. 
Evolution lacks a scientifically acceptable explanation of the source of the precisely planned codes within cells without which there can be no specific proteins and hence, no life.4 
That is because RNA is nothing but information insofar as protein structure is concerned. 
Amino acids are the raw material. 
When and how did this circle become closed? 
Stanley Miller, a professor at the University of California—San Diego, and the wellknown evolutionist Leslie Orgel, a colleague of Francis Crick, use the term "scenario" for the possibility that "life might have begun with the RNA World." 
Mars is a refuge for evolutionists who are unable to explain how the first cell might have come into being by chance in the conditions of the primeval world. 
These use hundreds of amino acids to produce protein. 
None of these can exist on its own, and if even one is missing, the cell cannot form. 
In the section of Science and Creationism called "Evidence Supporting Biological Evolution," anyone hoping to find evidence for the theory of evolution will suffer a grave disappointment. 
To give another example, in a herd of zebras which constantly have to flee from leopards, those which run fastest will survive while the others die. 
That is why the species in question continues to become ever better adapted. This may not always apply, of course. 
Evolutionists, however, believe that natural selection selects and gradually accumulates the same features in a species over millions of years, acting on variation within a species and then somehow giving rise to entirely different species. 
Natural selection is therefore a principle of local adaptation, not of general advance or progress.2 
The subject which evolutionists really need to explain is how the above "biologic properties that already exist" came to be. 
Evolutionists themselves confess that natural selection is unable to provide an answer. 
Darwin drew an analogy between the breeding of livestock (artificial selection) and natural selection, and concluded that if livestock and plant breeders can improve plants and animals through the use of artificial selection and breed sheep with better wool, cows with more flesh and better running horses, then nature may well do these also. 
This is circular reasoning. 
The fact is, however, that prominent evolutionists also accept that natural selection is a tautology. 
Karl Popper, regarded as one of the major philosophers of the twentieth century, cites evolutionists such as Ronald Fisher, J. B.S. Haldane and George Gaylord Simpson as examples, and says: 
Gould expresses that unwillingness in the words: "I, although I wear the Darwinian label with some pride, am not among the most ardent defenders of natural selection."11 Despite being the person who proposed the theory of natural selection, Darwin himself offered a rather prescient analysis: "I shall know that the theory of Natural Selection, is, in the main, safe; that it includes, as now put forth, many errors, is almost certain, though I cannot see them."12 
This is most clearly revealed in the study of irreducibly complex organs: these structures only provide any benefit to an organism when they are fully formed. 
A major change, for example, a sharp increase in the heart beat or the diminution by half of the kidney and thus a reduction in renal secretion, would by itself have wrought havoc with the general constitution of the animal. 
Richard Dawkins, for example, one of the most passionate proponents of the theory of evolution, defines natural selection in these terms in his book The Blind Watchmaker: 
Mutation, which acts on the complex information in the DNA in a random and unconscious manner, harms the DNA, and therefore harms the organism bearing the DNA. At best, it may have no effect at all. 
Such diseases caused by genetic mutations include Down's syndrome, sicklecell anemia, dwarfism, mental impairment, cystic fibrosis, and certain forms of cancer. 
In the same way that an earthquake cannot improve a city, nor a violent impact a clock, so too genetic mutations do not improve living things, but rather harm them. 
Evolutionists are aware of this, but still propose mutations as the mechanism that brings about evolution. 
Almost every mutation is harmful, and it is the individual who pays the price. 
The chance that a random change of a letter or word or phrase would improve the reading is remote; on the other hand, it is very likely that a random hit would be harmful. 
Weaver's question is a very important one, and demands an answer from evolutionists: How can a good effect—evolution to higher forms of life—result from mutations practically all of which are harmful? 
Mutations, in time, occur incoherently. 
The fact is, however, that there is no increase in complexity nor any improvement in the organism's functions; on the contrary, there is a defect. 
The Israeli biophysicist Professor Lee Spetner is one of the figures who have carried out the most detailed studies in this area. 
[T]he organisms having these genes can transfer them to other bacteria making them resistant as well. 
In his book Not By Chance, Spetner compares this to the disturbance of the keylock relationship. 
The reason for this, however, is that the mutation "deforms" the ribosome. 
In conclusion, there is no instance of a mutation that "improves genetic information," and the immunity mechanisms in bacteria do not represent evidence for the theory of evolution. 
Experiments on fruit flies: 
Confusion and controversy have often resulted because different people working with different groups of organisms mean different things by "species."1 
Professor Ali Demirsoy, a prominent proponent of Darwinism in Turkey, expresses this fact in these terms: 
In order to understand the deception in evolutionary theory with regard to speciation, "geographic isolation" first needs to be clarified. In every living species there are differences stemming from genetic variation. 
Cases of variation like these, with distinguishing morphological differences among subgroups of the same species, are known as "subspecies." 
It needs to be able to explain how living things without eyes, ears, hearts, lungs, wings, feet, and other organs and systems came to acquire them, and where the genetic information describing such systems and organs came from. 
This is in fact accepted by evolutionists. 
The questions that need to be answered are these: How did the living categories first come into being? 
In all of these examples, the genetic variation known to evolutionists as microevolution is used as proof of the theory they describe as macroevolution. 
In his book Sudden Origins: Fossils, Genes and the Emergence of Species, published in 2000, Jeffrey Schwartz, Professor of Anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh, stresses this fact: 
In the face of these facts, some evolutionists offer an explanation along the lines of "We cannot observe speciation by means of evolution because evolutionary mechanisms only act over very long periods of time. 
However, the difficulties facing evolutionists are not restricted to such observations and experiments: the fossil record also definitively rejects the concept of speciation. 
Evolutionists now offer the excuse that "speciation is so rapid that it cannot be seen in the fossil record" or, to put it more accurately, they attempt to console themselves with that thought. 
Moreover, scientific discoveries prove that Darwinism is an unscientific and unrealistic theory. 
Although these birds are classified into 14 different species, they closely resemble one another, possessing similar body shapes, colors, and habits. 
In Science and Creationism, it is suggested that these birds evolved from a single species that came from South America. 
The names of Peter Grant and his wife Rosemary Grant can be found in most articles and writings about the finches in question. 
In fact, the claims made about the finches in Science and Creationism are actually based on the Grants' work. 
These two researchers first went to the Galápagos Islands in 1973, with the aim of observing the effects of evolution on the finches, and carried out detailed studies and observations in the following years. 
The amount of rain is of vital importance for the finches, which feed on seeds. 
Grant and his colleagues measured the rainfall on Daphne Major, one of the Galápagos, as normal in 1976, but as only onefifth of that level in 1977. 
A greater period of time was required for natural selection to turn the medium ground finch into the cactuseating finch.17 Grant renewed his claims in subsequent articles, insisting that finches had verified Darwinism and proved that natural selection caused living things to evolve.18 
It is true that Professor Grant and his team put in a lot of work in the Galápagos Islands. 
Evolutionists' belief that they have found proof of evolution in the oscillation in finch beak sizes is a purely ideological one. 
Rather than confuse the reader by mentioning that selection was reversed after the drought, producing no longterm evolutionary change, the booklet simply omits this awkward fact. 
It is astonishing that an institution such as the National Academy of Sciences, which claims to be scientifically trustworthy, would perpetrate such a deception in order to provide evidence for evolution in finches and for natural selection in general. 
(Science and Creationism, p. ix) A book making such a claim would be expected to detail the series of intermediate forms in question, and to respond to criticisms directed at the classic putative intermediate forms (such as Archaeopteryx). 
For example, Henry Gee, the editor of the journal Nature, says in his book In Search of Deep Time that "mountains of evidence" supporting the theory of evolution have not been discovered in the fossil record, and that, on the contrary, the evidence which does exist is evaluated by evolutionists according to their own preconceptions: 
The EverMissing Transitional Forms 
Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? 
In the years that followed, Gould stated in other occasions, too, that he accepted the stasis observed in the fossil record. 
As can be seen from these words, Gould admits that a great many species underwent no changes. 
For instance, the trilobites, which lived in the Cambrian Period when the first animal phyla appear, possessed a rather complex eye structure. 
Professor Phillip Johnson of the University of California, Berkeley, one of the most important critics of Darwinism in the world, declares that this fact revealed by paleontology openly conflicts with Darwinism: 
Darwinian theory predicts a "cone of increasing diversity," as the first living organism, or first animal species, gradually and continually diversified to create the higher levels of taxonomic order. 
The questions that will be dealt with in more detail in the pages which follow are, in summary: 
There is no proof of anything here, merely an unproven hypothesis and phenomena interpreted in the light of that hypothesis. 
Dogmatic endeavors of this kind must eventually leave the realm of science.2 
Wolves, cats, squirrels, anteaters, moles, and mice all have their marsupial counterparts with closely similar morphologies.4 In other words, according to the theory of evolution, completely independent mutations must have twice chanced to produce these living things in exactly the same way! 
This represents a terrible dilemma for evolutionists. 
The former is placental and the latter marsupial. 
Common Structures With 
No matter how much evolutionists choose to ignore it, this truth has been known to scientists since the nineteenth century. 
For example, the American embryologist E. B. Wilson wrote in 1894, 
In salamanders, the development of digits is in the exact opposite direction, from the head to the tail. 
For example, many frogs start life as swimming tadpoles and turn into fourfooted animals at the last stage of metamorphosis. 
The way in which the NAS ignores facts known to and accepted by all scientific circles, and tries to portray discredited evidence for the theory of evolution as the definitive truth, is really astonishing. 
At the end of the chapter on "Common Structures" in the NAS book Science and Creationism, it is stated that "The mammalian ear and jaw are instances in which paleontology and comparative anatomy combine to show common ancestry through transitional stages." 
One proof of this transition, according to evolutionists and the NAS, is the socalled transitional form Therapsida, a group of mammallike reptiles with a double jaw joint. 
In the chapter entitled "The Distribution of Species," the NAS portrays the subject of biogeography, which is still the topic of much debate amongst evolutionists, as evidence of evolution (Science and Creationism, p. 
There is a geographical obstacle between these islands and other land masses. 
The reason why the NAS still seeks to portray claims known by the scientific community to be invalid as proof of evolution is another matter requiring investigation. 
Although not referred to by name in the NAS booklet, Ernst Haeckel led the way in portraying embryology as proof of evolution. 
By the closing years of the nineteenth century, Haeckel's program had become a source of much ridicule…3 
Surely the biogenetic law is as dead as a doornail. 
Yet, Haeckel selected only the salamander from amongst the amphibians so that it would fit his theory. 
The fact is, however, that his drawings do not include the early stages, but rather begin at the middle stages of development. 
The differences between the five classes are clear, even in the fertilized egg. 
If the theory regarding the early development of vertebrates were correct, we would expect these five classes to resemble each other most closely as fertilized eggs, to show more differences during division, and still more during gastrulation. 
Perhaps the worst of the totally unrealistic claims in the NAS booklet appear in the chapter "New Evidence from Molecular Biology." 
It was immediately obvious in 1959 that the two molecules are very closely related." 
What is not true is the suggestion by the NAS and other evolutionists that this similarity constitutes proof that hemoglobin evolved from myoglobin. 
Let us consider the reasons for this: 
Hemoglobin and myoglobin are molecules designed for a similar purpose, for which reason they have similar features. 
Thus, the supposed evolutionary history of the allegedly homologous globin molecules is a fantasy, not science.1 
It is suggested in Science and Creationism that an evolutionary family tree can be drawn up by comparing the proteins in living things, such as hemoglobin, myoglobin, or cytochrome c, and that this tree will agree with the paleontological and anatomical facts. 
One particular sequence of amino acids might give rise to a fatdigesting protein in the stomach, while another chain of amino acids might cause an oxygenbinding protein molecule to form. 
Generally speaking, the aminoacid sequence is the same for the same kind of protein in the same species. 
Evolutionists had claimed that the protein sequences of the turtle and snake, two reptiles, should be much closer to each another. 
Next came the viper and the chicken (10.5%). 
Phylogenetic incongruities can be seen everywhere in the universal tree, from its root to the major branchings within and among the various [groups] to the makeup of the primary groupings themselves. 
Yet he has had to confess several times that at no point has he been able to obtain any evidence for evolution. 
Before, people tended to equate rRNA trees with the [life history] tree of the organism. 
However, research in recent years has shown that genetic and morphological studies do not represent evidence for the claim that there is an evolutionary relationship between living species. 
Until recently, evolutionists constructed phylogenetic relationships between species by comparing physical characteristics. 
According to this claim, the similarities between the aminoacid sequences of these molecules in living things show that they evolved from one another. 
This claim is totally false. 
It is therefore no surprise that the same gene regions should have mutated in different species, and this does not require descent from a common ancestor. 
3. The phylogenetic trees constructed suing pseudogenes both are internally inconsistent and also conflict with other phylogenetic trees. 
Evidence of this kind is increasing all the time. 
It is thought that some parts of pseudogene sequences are copied to functional genes and produce various forms of the functional sequence. This has been reported several times. 
Examples include the immunoglobins of mice37 and birds38, mouse histone genes,39 horse globin genes,40 and human beta globin genes.41 
In the nineteenth century, evolutionists produced a list of hundreds of supposedly atrophied organs in the human body, such as the appendix and coccyx, which they claimed had lost their functions during the process of evolution. 
When it was first proposed, this hypothesis was greeted by evolutionists with great enthusiasm as a major trump card to be used against creationists. However, soon afterwards it emerged that it clashed with the data, especially with molecular evolutionary theories and paleontological findings. 
The article described how the biochemist Russell Doolittle and his team had used the molecular clock method to propose that singlecell creatures with a nucleus (eukaryotes) split off from those without a nucleus, such as bacteria (prokaryotes), some 2 billion years ago. 
It seems that the only general conclusion one can draw is that nothing about present techniques for analyzing molecular distance data is satisfactory ... 
The NAS authors continue this "maybethey'llbelieveit" logic throughout the chapter in question, setting out their socalled proofs one after the other. 
The Archaeocetes are believed to have originated from mesonychians [a family of oddtoed ungulates], which appeared before the Eocene. 
The zoologist John Gatesy states that analyses of sea mammals' blood coagulation protein have presented an evolutionary link between whales and hippopotamuses, but that this conflicts with the paleontological findings.63 
As we have seen, the scientists who actually did the research openly state that the molecular comparisons performed in order to discover the origin of the whale conflict with morphological and paleontological findings. 
The NAS, on the other hand, adopts the opposite point of view, despite that fact that the truth of the matter is well known. 
We have already examined the invalidity of the evolutionist theses on the subject of the origin of whales in our article "A Whale Fantasy From National Geographic." 
There is no doubt that one of the most debatable aspects of the theory of evolution concerns the evolution of man. 
23) In fact, however, fossil discoveries and other findings in recent years have shown that there is no scientific basis to the claim that human beings and apes are descended from a common ancestor. 
Even evolutionist scientists admit that the question of human evolution has become an intractable problem. 
However, even evolutionists admit that this claim fails to reflect the truth. 
Richard C. Lewontin from Harvard University has sincerely admitted the problematic nature of evolutionary scenarios on human origins: 
Thus, the theory of evolution is in "crisis," as Michael Denton puts it, with regard to the origin of man, as well. 
Lucy, for instance, the bestknown example of Australopithecus (Australopithecus afarensis), had a chimpsized brain, chimpshaped rib cage and jawbone, and arms and legs that indicate it walked like a chimp. 
The two researchers investigated Lucy and other fossils claimed to be hominid, and stated that Lucy possessed the same skeletal structure as knucklewalking apes.9 
The article, based on the discovery of a new Australopithecus, code number St W573, stated: 
Large primates, considered the ancestors of man, have been removed from the equation of this family tree… Australopithecus and Homo (human) species do not appear on the same branch. Man's direct ancestors are still waiting to be discovered.11 
The Myth of Molecular Evidence For Human Evolution 
The results of the Human Genome Project were published in 2001. 
The fact that molecular analyses conflict with findings in other areas and represent an insoluble dilemma for socalled human evolution is well known to the NAS. 
3) Another point requiring clarification, apart from all the above considerations, is the fact recent analyses have shown that the genetic difference between man and the chimpanzee is three times greater than previously believed. 
Research on this subject states that, contrary to the allegations in some evolutionist publications, the genetic similarity between man and chimpanzee is not 98% at all, but rather is really no more than 95%. 
But a biologist at the California Institute of Technology, said in a study published this week that a new way of comparing the genes shows that the human and chimp genetic similarity is only about 95 percent. 
The biologist based this on a computer program that compared 780,000 of the 3 billion base pairs in the human DNA helix with those of the chimp. 
The British scientific journal New Scientist, known for its devotion to Darwinism, carried a report entitled "HumanChimp DNA Difference Trebled," dated September 23, 2002, on its Internet site. This article stated: 
The existence of these genetic similarities is very normal, even inevitable. 
All life on Earth is "carbonbased"; in other words, it is constructed from organic molecules (carbon compounds). 
Scientists like Carl Linnaeus, who first systematized living things according to their similar structures, and Richard Owen regarded these structures as examples of "common design." 
You can find more details on this subject in our book Darwinism Refuted. 
G. A. Clark of the University of Arizona has this to say about the unreliability of the "molecular clock" method: 
Our results suggest serious problems with use of mtDNA to estimate "true" population genetic structure, to date cladogenic [branching evolution] events, and in some cases, to construct phylogenies.27 
It now looks set to be thrown into further confusion by the discovery of another species and genus, dated to 3.5 million years ago… The nature of Kenyanthropus platyops raises all kinds of questions, about human evolution in general and the behavior of this species in particular… I suspect the chief role of K. platyops in the next few years will be to act as a sort of party spoiler, highlighting the confusion that confronts research into evolutionary relationships among hominins.33 
We do not see constant progressive brain enlargement through time, or a climb to a more completely human posture. 
[T]he account of our own origins on earth remains largely unknown.40 
Evolutionists then portray this as evidence of evolution. 
The most important aspect of this is, without a doubt, the fact that the evolutionary history referred to by the NAS does not exist. 
These structures are both very complex and very different from each other. 
"No One Has Seen Evolution Occur" 
The NAS authors suggest that one of the creationists' main theses is that "no one has seen evolution occur." 
A DDT molecule attaches itself to a specific matching site on the membrane of the insect's nerve cells. 
Although such a change in a protein may bring resistance to poisons such as DDT, it may also lead to the loss of other functions or features. 
Naturally, as long as the pesticide in question is around, the creature gains resistance and survives, albeit at the cost of being less well adapted in some other way. 
This may bring about resistance, but it cannot increase the insect's or bacterium's genetic information. 
A Problem Too Complex for NAS: Irreducible Complexity The "irreducible complexity" of structures and systems in living things is one of the most serious dilemmas facing the theory of evolution. 
Since it is impossible for natural selection and mutation to consciously identify an objective in advance, the theory depends on the assumption that all the systems in living things can be "reduced" to myriad small steps, and that each individual transition from one step to another is beneficial to the organism. 
That is why Darwin said, "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down."10 
Darwin may have imagined, in the primitive state of science in the nineteenth century, that living things did possess a reducible structure. 
Although the concept of irreducible complexity is sufficient to demolish the theory of evolution all on its own, the NAS authors do devote some space to it. However, they do so only to suggest, in a manner devoid of any proof or logic, that irreducibly complex structures are really nothing of the sort: 
The NAS authors cite the hemoglobin molecule as an example of their claim. 
This is because what evolutionists need to do is not just to determine the degree of complexity between two different hemoglobin molecules, but rather to explain how hemoglobin (and all other proteins) came into being in the first place. 
They speak of it as though it already knew what the future desired function was and as though it always produced a useful function by gradually adding the appropriate components together. 
Moreover, the NAS authors, who claim that the blood clotting process may have gradually evolved by means of these mechanisms, need to prove these claims in some detail. 
You know that when you cut yourself, or when an old injury starts bleeding, the bleeding will eventually stop. 
(Michael Behe, Darwin's Black Box, New York: Free Press, pp. 7997) Damage to, or the absence of, just one of the components of this system will cause it to stop functioning. 
Working together, these cells eventually close up the wound. 
So far, more than 20 bodily chemicals have been identified as playing a role in the production of thrombin. 
These enzymes can trigger its reproduction or halt it. 
This network covers the area where the blood is flowing out. 
What would happen if even the smallest thing were to go wrong in this magnificently functioning system—if, say, there was blood clotting in the absence of any wound, or if the scab forming over the wound came off too easily? 
Although you are not aware of it, you constantly experience tiny hemorrhages throughout the course of the day. 
If the blow is quite violent, the hemorrhaging that occurs before clotting sets in is rather more violent—which is the reason "bruising" occurs. 
Hemophiliacs, who do lack just this system, spend their lives in this very manner. 
The NAS repeats the evolutionists' classic claim and suggests that creationism is not a scientific explanation (Science and Creationism, p. ix). 
The reason why the NAS authors neglect to refer to the Cambrian explosion even once throughout their book is their desire to conceal these facts. 
If there is a complex, meaningful design somewhere, which cannot be accounted for by unconscious effects, then that means there is an intelligent power which brought that design into being. 
Regarding the question of how design can be identified in biological structures, the scientific criteria put forward by the mathematician William Dembski may serve as a guide. 
In other words, you would be ignoring what the evidence plainly showed you, in order to be able to continue believing as you chose. 
In their booklet, the NAS authors claim that creationism should not be taught in schools because it is not scientific, but rather linked to religious belief. 
In addition, it must be made clear that the theory of evolution cannot account for life on Earth, and students should be taught about the scientific evidence against the theory. 
Otherwise, students will be condemned to hearing about a theory that is imposed by a onesided and ideological system. 
One outcome of this was the effect on the education system. 
The first decision came from Georgia, one of the states in the southeast of the USA. 
"I had to do a term paper about evolution and there were just things that I could disprove or have alternate reasons for," said Gray, who attends Pope High School. 
"I want my brother and sister to be given the option and not told it's the absolute truth."1 
Darwinist circles rushed to battle stations in the face of this decision. 
The ranks of these academic critics of Darwin are growing. 
Random events form the basis of this philosophy. 
As Columbia University professor Erwin Chargaff has stated, "Our time is probably the first in which mythology has penetrated to the molecular level." 
Phillip E. Johnson, known for his books criticizing the theory of evolution, says in his book Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds that evolutionists believe in a preconception without ever thinking about the claims of Darwinism or weighing up what these claims really imply: 
In his book Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, Michael Denton describes the oddness of a Darwinist's belief that the superior and complex systems in living things could be the work of random processes: 
To the skeptic, the proposition that the genetic programmes of higher organisms, consisting of something close to a thousand million bits of information, equivalent to the sequence of letters in a small library of 1,000 volumes, containing in encoded form countless thousands of intricate algorithms controlling, specifying, and ordering the growth and development of billions and billions of cells into the form of a complex organism, were composed by a purely random process is simply an affront to reason.

On entering the study Ryabinin looked about, as his habit was, as though seeking the holy picture, but when he had found it, he did not cross himself. 
Why should I give you my goods for nothing? 
But when one wants to sell, no one will give anything.... 
Levin scowled. 
No; I don't know whether you know it or not, but I don't care. 
The greater number of the young women, who envied Anna and had long been weary of hearing her called virtuous, rejoiced at the fulfillment of their predictions, and were only waiting for a decisive turn in public opinion to fall upon her with all the weight of their scorn. 
The greater number of the middleaged people and certain great personages were displeased at the prospect of the impending scandal in society. 
These two passions did not interfere with one another. 
Fortifying yourself for your work? said the plump officer, sitting down beside him. 
Nodding with an air of lofty contempt to the two officers, he went up to Vronsky. 
You must just eat a mouthful, now, and drink only one tiny glass. 
In was late at the Tverskoys', said Vronsky. 
Vronsky liked him both for his exceptional physical strength, which he showed for the most part by being able to drink like a fish, and do without sleep without being in the slightest degree affected by it; and for his great strength of character, which he showed in his relations with his comrades and superior officers, commanding both fear and respect, and also at cards, when he would play for tens of thousands and however much he might have drunk, always with such skill and decision that he was reckoned the best player in the English Club. 
Petritsky was asleep when Vronsky and Yashvin came into the hut. Get up, don't go on sleeping, said Yashvin, going behind the partition and giving Petritsky, who was lying with ruffled hair and with his nose in the pillow, a prod on the shoulder. 
Where is the letter? No, I've forgotten really. 
Petritsky went behind the partition and lay down on his bed. 
It was the letter he was expectingfrom his mother, reproaching him for not having been to see herand the note was from his brother to say that he must have a little talk with him. 
Here are my saviors! cried Petritsky, seeing them come in. 
Oh, didn't we make a pretty finish! said Petritsky. Volkov climbed onto the roof and began telling us how sad he was. 
No; goodbye all of you. I'm not going to drink today. 
Don't you think I want more thinning down? 
Before he had driven many paces away, the dark clouds that had been threatening rain all day broke, and there was a heavy downpour of rain. 
As he sat in solitude in the closed carriage, he took out his mother's letter and his brother's note, and read them through. 
And for the first time the idea clearly presented itself that it was essential to put an end to this false position, and the sooner the better. 
No, I'll go in from the garden. 
I'm not too late? 
So you won't recognize your friends! 
A little light hussar in tight riding breeches rode off at a gallop, crouched up like a cat on the saddle, in imitation of English jockeys. 
Gladiator and Diana came up to it together and almost at the same instant; simultaneously they rose above the stream and flew across to the other side; FrouFrou darted after them, as if flying; but at the very moment when Vronsky felt himself in the air, he suddenly saw almost under his mare's hoofs Kuzovlev, who was floundering with Diana on the further side of the stream. 
He just had time to free his leg when she fell on one side, gasping painfully, and, making vain efforts to rise with her delicate, soaking neck, she fluttered on the ground at his feet like a shot bird. 
He felt utterly wretched. 
For the first time in his life he knew the bitterest sort of misfortune, misfortune beyond remedy, and caused by his own fault. 
This man, so subtle and astute in official life, did not realize all the senselessness of such an attitude to his wife. 
I will do it for the sake of Russia, countess, replied the doctor. 
They had been comrades at the university, and though they rarely met, they thought highly of each other and were excellent friends, and so there was no one to whom the doctor would have given his opinion of a patient so freely as to Sludin. How glad I am you've been seeing him! said Sludin. He's not well, and I fancy.... 
There's no hurry, said Anna. 
If Alexey Alexandrovitch had allowed himself to observe he would have noticed the timid and bewildered eyes with which Seryozha glanced first at his father and then at his mother. 
He's grown. 
But you'll come back here after the races, I suppose? 
You'll come back for some tea; that's delightful! she said, and went out, gay and radiant. 
But as soon as she no longer saw him, she was aware of the spot on her hand that his lips had touched, and she shuddered with repulsion. 
All these ways of his she knew, and all were hateful to her. 
Anna heard his high, measured tones, not losing one word, and every word struck her as false, and stabbed her ears with pain. 
No, all he wants is falsehood and propriety, Anna said to herself, not considering exactly what it was she wanted of her husband, and how she would have liked to see him behave. 
It's not superficial, said Princess Tverskaya. 
One of the officers, they say, has broken two ribs. 
It forms an integral part of the duties of an officer. 
At that moment a tall general walked through the pavilion. 
Alexey Alexandrovitch too was silent, and everyone stood up and turned towards the stream. 
I spite of all he had seen, Alexey Alexandrovitch still did not allow himself to consider his wife's real condition. 
The despair you were unable to conceal at the accident to one of the riders. 
I sent to Alexey to find out how he is, and he writes me he is quite well and unhurt, but in despair. 
My daughter has lost her heart to you, she said. 
I don't think I did anything, she said. 
Madame Stahl had now been living more than ten years continuously abroad, in the south, never leaving her couch. 
The princess, hearing that Varenka had a good voice, asked her to come and sing to them in the evening. 
Varenka came, however, in the evening and brought a roll of music with her. 
Kitty and Varenka went out into the little garden that adjoined the house. 
I cared for someone once, and I used to sing him that song. 
I that case he would have done wrong, and I should not have regretted him, answered Varenka, evidently realizing that they were now talking not of her, but of Kitty. 
The shame, the humiliation! 
She went indoors, collected her music, and saying goodbye to everyone, was about to go. Allow me to see you home, said the colonel. 
Yes, how can you go alone at night like this? chimed in the princess. 
This was a lofty, mysterious religion connected with a whole series of noble thoughts and feelings, which one could do more than merely believe because one was told to, which one could love. 
The princess saw that in the evenings Kitty read a French testament that Madame Stahl had given hera thing she had never done before; that she avoided society acquaintances and associated with the sick people who were under Varenka's protection, and especially one poor family, that of a sick painter, Petrov. 
No, it can't be, it oughtn't to be! He's so much to be pitied! she said to herself directly after. 
Before the end of the course of drinking the waters, Prince Shtcherbatsky, who had gone on from Carlsbad to Baden and Kissingen to Russian friendsto get a breath of Russian air, as he saidcame back to his wife and daughter. 
But these unpleasant matters were all drowned in the sea of kindliness and good humor which was always within him, and more so than ever since his course of Carlsbad waters. 
I like even your horrid Soden for making you so well again. 
She at once began talking to him with French exaggerated politeness, applauding him for having such a delightful daughter, extolling Kitty to the skies before her face, and calling her a treasure, a pearl, and a consoling angel. 
Why don't you go up to him? He wanted to speak to you. 
Well, let us go, then, said Kitty, turning round resolutely. 
And you must know they've three children, no servant, and scarcely any means. 
Several invalids were lingering near the low carriage, staring at the lady as though she were some curiosity. 
That is not for us to judge, said Madame Stahl, perceiving the shade of expression on the prince's face. 
She's a very bad figure. 
Papa, it's not possible! cried Kitty. 
Perhaps so, said the prince, squeezing her hand with his elbow; but it's better when one does good so that you may ask everyone and no one knows. 
She felt a feeling such as she had known in childhood, when she had been shut in her room as a punishment, and had heard her sisters' merry laughter outside. 
How different it is at home! 
When she had recovered, she said goodbye, and went into the house to get her hat. Kitty followed her. 
You don't want me towhy not? I didn't say that, said Varenka quietly. 
Well, well! Kitty urged impatiently, looking darkly at Varenka. 
I can't be different.... 
Her eyes were, it seemed, opened; she felt all the difficulty of maintaining herself without hypocrisy and selfconceit on the pinnacle to which she had wished to mount. 
It's beyond everything what's being done in the district, according to what this doctor tells me. 
If decent people won't go into it, of course it's bound to go all wrong. 
I don't think it important; it does not take hold of me, I can't help it, answered Levin, making out that what he saw was the bailiff, and that the bailiff seemed to be letting the peasants go off the ploughed land. They were turning the plough over. 
How can you think it a matter of no importance whether the peasant, whom you love as you assert... 
Next, the peasant who can read and write is as a workman of more use and value to you. 
No, you can ask anyone you like, Konstantin Levin answered with decision, the man that can read and write is much inferior as a workman. 
He disliked contradiction, and still more, arguments that were continually skipping from one thing to another, introducing new and disconnected points, so that there was no knowing to which to reply. 
Do you admit that education is a benefit for the people? 
That you can't tell without making the trial. 
The bailiff smiled and said: Yes, sir. 
At tea the same evening Levin said to his brother: I fancy the fine weather will last. 
Tomorrow I shall start mowing. 
I sometimes mow myself with the peasants, and tomorrow I want to try mowing the whole day. 
Sergey Ivanovitch lifted his head, and looked with interest at his brother. How do you mean? Just like one of the peasants, all day long? 
Look'ee now, master, once take hold of the rope there's no letting it go! he said, and Levin heard smothered laughter among the mowers. I'll try not to let it go, he said, taking his stand behind Tit, and waiting for the time to begin. 
Levin straightened himself, and drawing a deep breath looked round. 
Levin gave his scythe to Tit, and together with the peasants, who were crossing the long stretch of mown grass, slightly sprinkled with rain, to get their bread from the heap of coats, he went towards his house. 
And while he did this he kept looking about and watching what came into his view: at one moment he picked a wild berry and ate it or offered it to Levin, then he flung away a twig with the blade of the scythe, then he looked at a quail's nest, from which the bird flew just under the scythe, or caught a snake that crossed his path, and lifting it on the scythe as though on a fork showed it to Levin and threw it away. 
Look'ee, the little emmets crawling! he said, pointing to them, and he shaded his eyes with his hand to look at the sun. 
Sergey Ivanovitch could not endure flies, and in his own room he never opened the window except at night, and carefully kept the door shut. 
But I'll go and wash. 
Oh, by the way, there's a letter for you, said he. 
The sight of his younger brother's appearance had immediately put him in a good humor. 
No, but for all sorts of nervous invalids. Yes, it ought to be tried. 
He was embarrassed through a sense that Darya Alexandrovna would be annoyed by receiving from an outsider help that should by rights have come from her own husband. Darya Alexandrovna certainly did not like this little way of Stepan Arkadyevitch's of foisting his domestic duties on others. 
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, Darya Alexandrovna! he said, smiling goodhumoredly to the mother; there's no chance of my hurting or dropping her. 
Let me ask you, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, said Darya Alexandrovna, smiling her kindly and rather mocking smile, why is it you are angry with Kitty? 
What makes you suppose I know? 
At the time when you made Kitty an offer she was just in a position in which she could not answer. 
Supposing she had been older...I, for instance, in her place could have felt no doubt. 
I always disliked him, and so it has turned out. Levin recalled Kitty's answer. She had said: No, that cannot be... 
I don't say she cared for you, all I meant to say is that her refusal at that moment proves nothing. 
The shafthorses were tilted against the shafts by the ruts, but the dexterous driver sitting on the box held the shaft over the ruts, so that the wheels ran on the smooth part of the road. 
The only thing that interested him now was the question of in what way he could best, with most propriety and comfort for himself, and thus with most justice, extricate himself from the mud with which she had spattered him in her fall, and then proceed along his path of active, honorable, and useful existence. 
And he began passing in review the methods of proceeding of men who had been in the same position that he was in. 
This horror had in his youth set him pondering on dueling, and picturing himself in a position in which he would have to expose his life to danger. 
Passing in mental review all the instances he knew of divorces (there were plenty of them in the very highest society with which he was very familiar), Alexey Alexandrovitch could not find a single example in which the object of divorce was that which he had in view. 
I must inform her of my conclusion, that thinking over the terrible position in which she has placed her family, all other solutions will be worse for both sides than an external status quo, and that such I agree to retain, on the strict condition of obedience on her part to my wishes, that is to say, cessation of all intercourse with her lover. 
Though Alexey Alexandrovitch was perfectly aware that he could not exert any moral influence over his wife, that such an attempt at reformation could lead to nothing but falsity; though in passing through these difficult moments he had not once thought of seeking guidance in religion, yet now, when his conclusion corresponded, as it seemed to him, with the requirements of religion, this religious sanction to his decision gave him complete satisfaction, and to some extent restored his peace of mind. 
My decision is as follows. Whatever your conduct may have been, I do not consider myself justified in breaking the ties in which we are bound by a Higher Power. 
She could not bring herself to call her maid, and still less go downstairs and see her son and his governess. 
What about Seryozha? Anna asked, with sudden eagerness, recollecting her son's existence for the first time that morning. 
The recollection of her son suddenly roused Anna from the helpless condition in which she found herself. 
She had an aim in life. And she must act; act to secure this relation to her son, so that he might not be taken from her. Quickly indeed, as quickly as possible, she must take action before he was taken from her. She must take her son and go away. 
Yes, it's very wrong, said Anna, and taking her son by the shoulder she looked at him, not severely, but with a timid glance that bewildered and delighted the boy, and she kissed him. 
I have told my husband, she wrote, and she sat a long while unable to write more. 
The courier had orders to wait for an answer, he said. 
These two ladies were the chief representatives of a select new Petersburg circle, nicknamed, in imitation of some imitation, les sept merveilles du monde. These ladies belonged to a circle which, though of the highest society, was utterly hostile to that in which Anna moved. 
She was not forced to think what she was to do. 
Anna knew that Betsy knew everything, but, hearing how she spoke of Vronsky before her, she almost felt persuaded for a minute that she knew nothing. 
Ah! said Anna indifferently, as though not greatly interested in the matter, and she went on smiling: How can you or your friends compromise anyone? 
Besides, they're received everywhere, and _I_she laid special stress on the Ihave never been strict and intolerant. 
It's simply that I haven't the time. No; you don't care, perhaps, to meet Stremov? 
What does it mean? 
Liza Merkalova's husband carries her shawl, and is always ready to be of use. 
But, anyway, it suits her. 
Sappho Shtoltz was a blonde beauty with black eyes. 
Only fancy, we all but ran over two soldiers, she began telling them at once, using her eyes, smiling and twitching away her tail, which she flung back at one stroke all on one side. 
The unexpected young visitor, whom Sappho had invited, and whom she had forgotten, was, however, a personage of such consequence that, in spite of his youth, both the ladies rose on his entrance. 
The weary, and at the same time passionate, glance of those eyes, encircled by dark rings, impressed one by its perfect sincerity. 
On meeting Anna Karenina, as he was Alexey Alexandrovitch's enemy in the government, he tried, like a shrewd man and a man of the world, to be particularly cordial with her, the wife of his enemy. 
It's just as you mustn't be afraid of not being able to fall asleep, if you're afraid of sleeplessness. 
In spite of Vronsky's apparently frivolous life in society, he was a man who hated irregularity. 
And not with out inward pride, and not without reason, he thought that any other man would long ago have been in difficulties, would have been forced to some dishonorable course, if he had found himself in such a difficult position. 
Resolving on this, he promptly wrote a note to Rolandak, who had more than once sent to him with offers to buy horses from him. 
These principles were possibly not reasonable and not good, but they were of unfailing certainty, and so long as he adhered to them, Vronsky felt that his heart was at peace and he could hold his head up. 
His connection with Madame Karenina, by creating so much sensation and attracting general attention, had given him a fresh distinction which soothed his gnawing worm of ambition for a while, but a week before that worm had been roused up again with fresh force. 
The whole party were in the wide lower balcony. 
He had gone out as far as the first step of the balcony and was loudly shouting across the band that played Offenbach's quadrille, waving his arms and giving some orders to a few soldiers standing on one side. 
They tossed Serpuhovskoy in the air and caught him again several times. 
Then, to the accompaniment of the band, the colonel himself danced with Petritsky. 
Vronsky mentioned a few men who were in power. 
And, ashamed as he was of the feeling, he felt envious. 
He enjoyed the slight ache in his strong leg, he enjoyed the muscular sensation of movement in his chest as he breathed. The bright, cold August day, which had made Anna feel so hopeless, seemed to him keenly stimulating, and refreshed his face and neck that still tingled from the cold water. 
If I doubted... 
She saw at once that he had been thinking about it before by himself. She knew that whatever he might say to her, he would not say all he thought. And she knew that her last hope had failed her. 
For me there is one thing, and one thing onlyyour love. If that's mine, I feel so exalted, so strong, that nothing can be humiliating to me. 
She shook her head, not answering. 
Yes; but it all depends on him. 
We go into everything ourselves. 
He considered the Russian peasant as occupying a stage of development intermediate between the ape and the man, and at the same time in the local assemblies no one was readier to shake hands with the peasants and listen to their opinion. 
Oh, you've not been to see our school, have you? 
Though, instead of that, you'd never believe itthe drunkenness, the immorality! They keep chopping and changing their bits of land. Not a sight of a horse or a cow. 
The graywhiskered landowner smiled at the mention of the profits of Sviazhsky's famling, obviously aware how much gain his neighbor and marshal was likely to be making. 
Rent there may be in Europe, where land has been improved by the labor put into it, but with us all the land is deteriorating from the labor put into itin other words they're working it out; so there's no question of rent. 
Because it would be just like inventing afresh the means for constructing railways. 
"Come, Nerina," the baron told his wife, "greet our friend." 
Dear Mandorallen," she said, kissing the knight with a brief, chaste embrace, "we have missed thee at Vo Ebor." 
Though I have no cause for anxiety, knowing full well the fidelity of my wife and my dearest friend, idle tongues would make scandal were they left together unattended. 
I will seek them out, one and all, and harry them out of the land. 
"That's an idea that appeals to me. 
Are there any signs of the Orb about?" Barak rumbled as he stowed his bearskin cloak and helmet in one of the packs. 
We're holding our own at least. 
The customs agent, a stout, balding man in a belted gown of a rusty brown color, came out of the stone building, brushing crumbs from the front of his clothes. 
He opened the top of one of the packs and pulled out a corner of woven gray cloth. Your prospects are good, worthy merchant," the customs agent said, fingering the cloth. 
It's all terribly expensive of course, and we Tolnedrans get agitated when there's money involved." Silk laughed briefly. 
Unfortunately, though, the selection's in the hands of the Council of Advisers." 
"You wouldn't believe the size of the bribes some of those men are asking for their votes, worthy Radek." 
I don't begrudge any man the right to a decent, reasonable bribe," the stout agent complained, "but some of the men on the council have gone mad with greed. 
It's the same all over Tolnedra. 
"We're in control now, but the Honeths are richer than we are. 
And all the while Ran Borune sits in the palace doting on that little monster he calls a daughter and with so many guards around that we can't persuade even the bravest assassin to make an attempt on him. 
A proper sort of place," Durnik said approvingly, looking around at the white stone houses with their redtiled roofs. 
"Everything seems neat and orderly." 
Then apologize to him for knocking him down." 
His voice sounded very normal, and the welt on his forehead was gone. 
A half dozen slovenly, unshaven soldiers had accosted an arrogantlooking man in a green mantle. Stand aside, I say," the arrogant man protested sharply. We just want a word or two with you, Lembor," one of the.soldiers said with an evillooking leer. 
What are they going to do to him?" Durnik asked. 
What's the usual?" 
The fool should have known better than to come out without his bodyguards." 
Let me go," Lembor protested. 
Just come along quietly, Lembor," the scarfaced soldier ordered. 
One of the soldiers smashed the captive in the mouth with his fist, and they pulled him into the alley. 
He just came down with a bad case of dead. It looks like you're out of work." 
"But then again we might be able to create a few vacancies in Elgon's garrison. 
All right, Rabbas, Kragger, that's enough," the sergeant in charge said sharply. 
"We were just leaving anyway." 
Let's find out what he's up to," Silk suggested, his eyes bright. 
Then the little man turned and disappeared into the crowd. 
"Lembor, you say?" an ashenfaced merchant in a blue mantle exclaimed to another shaken man. "Impossible." 
What's going to happen to us?" the first man asked in a shaking voice. 
I don't know about you, but I'm going to hide. 
It's too late now," the second man said. 
"We might as well eat, father," Aunt Pol said, seating herself at a table of wellscrubbed oak in the sunny common room. 
They had nearly finished eating when a shabbylooking little man in a linen shirt, leather apron and a ragged hat came in and plunked himself unceremoniously at the end of their table. 
I like this one," the stranger said. 
You've been spending too much time with Silk lately," Aunt Pol said acidly. 
The moonlight filtered in among the trees and dappled the leaf strewn ground. 
A heavy foot was pushed down on his chest, and the point of a sword was set firmly, uncomfortably against his throat. 
Durnik, who had been standing guard, was held by two roughlooking soldiers, and a piece of rag was stuffed in his mouth. 
What does this mean?" Silk demanded of the soldiers. 
"I'm Radek of Boktor, a merchant, and my friends and I haven't done anything wrong." 
"Let's go see this Count Dravor, then. 
THE HOUSE OF Count Dravor was a large white building set in the center of a broad lawn with clipped hedges and formal gardens on either side. 
The moon, fully overhead now, illuminated every detail as they rode slowly up a whitegraveled, curving road that led to the house. 
What have you done wrong?" 
There must be some sort of mistake." 
You need your rest. 
You mustn't overtire yourself, you know." 
"It's curious to find her servant dancing to a Grolim tune." 
"I gather, then, that you don't intend to turn us over to the Grolims?" 
I'm not interested in the Grolims," Y'diss said. 
What's Salmissra's interest in this matter?" Wolf asked. 
And I think you're wrong, my dear Baron," Y'diss replied with a cold smile. 
It was dark, but it was not silent. 
"Accursed rust!" he swore. 
Then he grunted, and there was a grating click from the door. 
"There!" 
Garion almost ran from the cell. 
Her motives don't really interest me all that much. 
There was a long pause. 
Eight," Aunt Pol said firmly. 
Y'diss says it doesn't matter if some of them die under the questioning," one of the men outside said. 
They swarmed over the startled jailers in a savage rush. 
The wideeyed man cried out once just as Hettar's hands closed on him. The tall Algar straightened, spun about and slammed the man into the stone wall with terrific force. 
After what seemed a long time, he returned with the weapons the soldiers had taken from them. 
"I thought we might need these." 
"The green tastes bad," Count Dravor said drowsily, "but it gives me such lovely dreams. 
The red tastes better, but the dreams aren't so nice." 
The black's best of all." Silk led them on tiptoe past the half open door. 
How'd you manage that?" Barak asked. 
That means we'll have to dodge Nyissans as well as Murgos." 
I think I'd better stop by the palace and have a talk with Ran Borune," Mister Wolf said. 
"The Borunes aren't the easiest emperors to deal with, but they're the most intelligent. 
And announce your presence to the whole city?" 
He could get us into the palace to see the Emperor without all that much fuss." 
"The garrison's located near the main wharves on the downstream end of the island." 
There are men along this street who could buy most of Arendia if they wanted to." 
Arendia is not for sale," Mandorallen said stiffly. 
"Would you like to rephrase that question," he asked, "while you still have your health?" 
The guard opened the gate quickly, and the party rode into a spacious courtyard. 
He came down the stairs two at a time and caught Barak in a vast bear hug. "You pirate!" he roared. 
Grinneg's eyes glittered with a momentary hunger. 
Several pitchsmeared torches smoked in iron rings on the stone wall. 
"My house is yours," he said respectfully. 
"I have to talk to him, and I don't want to stir up any fuss in the process." 
You've come to Tol Honeth during a turbulent period," he said after the amenities were over. 
"Dynastic succession only happens a few times in each eon. 
The Borunes have been in power now for over six hundred years, and the other houses are anticipating the changeover with a great deal of enthusiasm." 
"He seems to have more money than the rest. 
The Honeths are richer, of course, but they've got seven candidates, and their wealth is spread out a little too thin. 
"It wouldn't be suitable. 
I'm sure the ambassador can lend you a mantle. 
You won't be quite so obvious that way." 
Grinneg made a curt gesture to his guards, and the party followed Lord Morin through a broad courtyard to a columned gallery that ran along one of the buildings. 
"What are you doing in Tol Honeth, my Lord?" 
It's this matter of urgency, your Highness," Morin replied apologetically. 
He launched himself into the air and fluttered directly to Aunt Pol. 
May I have my canary back?" the Emperor asked Aunt Pol rather plaintively. 
Some of them have even gone to the trouble of trying to help me along. 
Belgarath and Polgara?" the bushybrowed man scoffed. 
"You don't exist. 
"Of course most of his tricks are just sleight of hand, since sorcery's only a sham, but he amuses me and he takes himself very seriously. 
You may proceed, Zereel, but try not to raise an awful stink, as you usually do." 
I think I can accept that," Ran Borune said, still trembling and staring at the nowsilent canary. 
I'm sure, however, that you can see the importance of the event." 
Surely you're not that simple," Aunt Pol remarked. 
"The Alorns and the Angaraks have been squabbling over that worthless stone for thousands of years. 
Really?" Aunt Pol said. 
At first Garion thought she was a child, but as she came closer, he realized that she was somewhat older than that. 
The legionnaires won't let me leave the palace grounds!" 
I don't want to send anyone!" she shouted at him. 
Well, you can't," he said flatly. 
She looked back at him, her eyes challenging. Go ahead and say it, father," she told him. 
What did you have in mind?" 
If you could see your way clear to speak to the Alorns, I might be able to make a few concessions regarding the Murgosrestrictions on their numbers, closed areas, that sort of thing." 
The gentlemen from Cthol Murgos were most accommodating." I'm delighted to hear it," Ran Borune said, throwing a meaningful look at Mister Wolf. 
Something brushed Garion's mind, tentative onlynot the powerful force the Murgo had directed at him in the dim hallway in Anheg's palace at Val Alorn. 
The amulet under his tunic became very cold and yet seemed to burn at the same time. 
"Well, Ambar," he said to Silk, "your fortunes seem to have improved since we met last in Mingan's counting room in Darine." Silk spread his hands in an innocentlooking gesture. 
Asharak smiled briefly. 
Why is it that I feel as if I'm missing about half of this conversation?" Ran Borune asked. Forgive us, your Highness," Asharak said. 
I wish I'd had the opportunity to see the first act." 
As you may have noticed, Belgarath sometimes gets carried away with his own cleverness." 
I look forward to our next meeting, Belgarath," Asharak said. I wouldn't if I were you," Wolf advised him, then turned and led the way out of the Emperor's garden. 
Do we leave now, then?" Mandorallen asked. There's something I have to do first," Wolf replied, squinting into the sunlight. 
"There are a few things I need." 
Silk's face blanched often at her purchases, since he was paying for them. 
If we put Kador on the throne, he'll grind us all under foot. There's such a thing as being too imperial." 
His greatgrandfather bought his way into the House of Vordue, and I'd sooner open a vein than bow to the offspring of a sneak thief from the docks of Tol Vordue." 
"I'd be willing to pay quite a bit for something like that." 
"Why doesn't somebody do something?" he demanded. 
They're afraid," Silk said. 
Shouldn't someone notify the authorities?" Durnik suggested, his face pale and his voice shaking. 
Aunt Pol came back to where they were standing. 
"The men I sent after you were very professional." Silk bowed with an ironic little flourish. "They were quite good, Bethra," he agreed with a wry grin. 
"I had to get rid of you. You were disrupting my entire plan." Silk grinned wickedly. "I know," he gloated. 
She made a disgusted face. 
"If you're not presently involved with them, I'd appreciate anything you could tell me." 
Couldn't we just call it professional courtesy?" 
I was hoping you might be able to come by for a visit. 
You're a dangerous woman, Bethra." In more ways than one," she admitted, stretching languidly. 
I hunger for the opportunity to repay my debt," he said impudently. 
"You're a very bad man." 
Surely you don't imagine that I enjoy that sort of thing?" 
"We're going to have to do something about him sooner or later. 
What's this?" Aunt Pol asked. 
"If we have to go to Sthiss Tor, it would probably be better to sail there rather than wade through the swamps in northern Nyissa." That's a very good idea, actually," she approved. 
They were a peculiar pair. 
I see," the girl said. 
Quite a ways," Silk answered. 
"I'm Radek of Boktor, a Drasnian merchant, and I'm bound to the south with Sendarian woolens. 
"My pupil and I are bound for Tol Borune ourselves." 
I don't see any reason why not," Aunt Pol decided before he could refuse. You're most kind, gracious lady," the stranger said. 
Jeebers looked a bit disappointed. "I suppose that's true," he said. 
"Would you and your pupil care to join us, Master Jeebers? 
"It's imprudent to travel alone, and the Lady Sharell's been entrusted to my care. 
You saw the way she acted toward her father." 
When the proper time comes, I don't want to have to take the world apart looking for her." 
To make it all worse, each time he tried to resist, Aunt Pol would firmly remind him to pay more attention to his manners. 
Inevitably, he became quite surly about the whole business. 
At first she seemed content to be on a simple excursion to visit relatives; then she dropped dark hints about flight from a marriage to an ugly old merchant. 
"Lying is an art. A good lie shouldn't be embellished so much. 
"My relatives live on an estate to the south of the city." 
"This seems like as good a place as any for us to have a little talk," she said. Silk looked quickly at her and then nodded. 
They already know anyway," she said. 
We'll need bait," Barak said, getting up quickly. 
After all the trouble I went to persuading him to leave?" Aunt Pol asked. 
He looked off into the darkness in the direction of Tol Borune. "It will take Jeebers a certain amount of time to convince the people in the city that he's not a lunatic," he said, "but it would probably be a good idea if we left the area. 
Am I to consider myself a prisoner then?" the princess asked stifliy. 
THEY MOVED RAPIDLY SOUTH for the next few days, traveling frequently at night to avoid the mounted patrols of legionnaires who were beating the countryside in their efforts to locate Ce'Nedra. 
"I mean being able to hear a horse's thoughts?" 
I don't think I can describe it exactly," Hettar answered. 
"I've always been able to do it, so I can't imagine what it's like not doing it. There's a kind of reachingout in a horse's minda sort of inclusiveness. 
"Have we got time to reach those trees?" He pointed at a thick stand of scrub maple about a half mile ahead. 
They reached the trees just as the first few raindrops of the spring shower that had been threatening all morning pattered on the broad leaves. 
The captain in charge of the legionnaires pulled in his horse not far from the stand of maples and dispersed his men with a series of sharp commands. 
They moved out in small groups, scouting the weedy road in both directions and surveying the surrounding countryside from the top of the next rise. 
The captain squinted distastefully up into the sprinkling rain. "It's going to be a wet day," he said, dismounting and pulling his crimson cloak tighter around him. 
There's no guarantee that we'll find them, though," the captain said. 
Garion resented that. 
When Wolf led them beneath those trees, the change was as abrupt as if they had suddenly gone inside a house. 
Woodcutters?" Ce'Nedra gasped. 
"In here? 
They rode in under a colossal oak beside a sparkling stream purling over mossy rocks, dismounted and set up their duncolored tents. 
There seemed to be no menace in it, merely a kind of watchfulness. Some distance from the tents he found a fairly large pool where the stream dropped in a waterfall from the rocks above. 
Whatever are you doing?" Ce'Nedra asked. 
Don't be such a ninny," she told him. 
Bring me the soap," she commanded. 
After what seemed an eternity, the princess completed her bath, emerged from the pool, dried herself and put her clothes back on. 
You Sendars have such curious notions," she said as they sat together in the sunwarmed glade beside the pool. 
She was combing her deep red hair, her head inclined to one side and the comb pulling down through the thick, damp tangles. 
I'm not supposed to take it off," he told her. "Mister Wolf and Aunt Pol say I'm never supposed to take it off for any reason. 
"They aren't really sorcerers, are they?" 
You're making an awful mess of it," she observed critically. 
"You have nice hair for a man," she said. 
"All right, now you tell me what it's like to grow up as a very special person." 
I'm not that special." You're an Imperial Princess," he reminded her. 
"I'd call that pretty special." 
"You know, sometimes since I joined you people, I almost forget that I'm an Imperial Princess." 
I think it has something to do with my family. 
Garion blushed and then grew angry with himself for blushing. 
Garion glanced at the sky and saw a layer of inky clouds moving up from the south, staining the bright blue sky as they rolled ponderously northward. 
The strange fear that seemed to permeate the wood grew stronger. There's something moving over there," Garion whispered urgently and pointed at the dark trees on the other side of the stream. 
A vague shape slid from tree to another in the half light. 
Garion looked quickly around and saw another limb. He too armed himself. Another figure shambled between two trees, a bit closer this time. 
Desperately he swung again and struck the thing solidly on the forearm. 
With a mighty swing, Barak cut off the head of the first mudman. 
The headless creature turned and groped blindly, trying to put its hands on its attacker. 
Barak paled visibly and then chopped away both outstretched arms. 
Barak bent and ripped away the remaining arm which held Ce'Nedra. 
You stay where you are." 
The mudmen, still mindlessly stumbling forward, began to ooze and dissolve in the thundering downpour. 
The serpent's flickering tongue darted at her. 
Aunt Pol and my grandfather don't like it when I try to be brave," he explained. 
The silent trees watched him, but they seemed somehow less unfriendly this morning. 
He looked up quickly, his hand going to his sword. 
When the time comes, I get to kill it." 
They gathered about Garion, giggling and chattering as they examined him. 
It seems a shame to waste it," one remarked. 
Ce'Nedra!" the one called Xera exclaimed. 
She threw her arms around his neck, pulled his head down and kissed him soundly. "Did you bring us any sweets?" she demanded. The old man put on a sober expression and began rummaging through his many pockets. 
Eight," the Tittle Dryad countered. 
Those sweets aren't good for them, you know," she chided. 
She finally came over to Garion. "You're not thinking about running away, are you?" she asked hopefully. 
It was late afternoon by the time they reached a large clearing in the center of the Wood. 
Tentatively Garion felt a faint touch on his mind, almost like the soft brush of a leaf against his face. 
I'll tell my mother you've arrived," the one called Xera said and went toward the tree. 
"The Dryads seem very fond of him." 
Aunt Pol went forward to meet her, and the others trailed behind at a respectful distance. 
If it's a treaty, it must be honored, dear," the queen said gently. 
It's your duty to remain with your father and to obey him." 
Your silly little whims are quite beside the point. 
I think something momentous is happening out there in the world of the humans, and it may even touch our lives in this Wood. 
If we're successful, I think the Angaraks will attack the West anyway out of desperation. 
Certain ancient prophecies are getting close to their fulfillment. There are signs everywhere, and even the twisted perceptions of the Grolims can read them." 
"We served the same Master for a very long time, and that puts a certain mark on people." 
Yesabout six years old or so." The old man frowned, and then his eyes opened very wide. "So that's how he did it," he exclaimed. 
There's a Drasnian trade enclave near the wharves in Sthiss Tor," Silk said. "Several of the merchants there are my friends. 
I think you'll have to stay with us," Aunt Pol answered. 
Your pouting doesn't wring my heart, and your fluttering eyelashes don't really impress me." 
Garion sat on a log, somberly watching the old man bundle up some food. 
I am sorely ashamed of my weakness and my fault." 
I have striven for perfection and struck, I think, not too far off the mark; but now that perfection, which was the marvel of the world, is flawed. 
Queen Xantha exchanged a startled glance with Aunt Pol and then looked at Garion rather closely. 
"Some of my younger daughters will guide you to the river that marks the southern border of our Wood," she continued. 
Her voice showed no sign of any change, but her eyes seemed thoughtful. 
"If you can send word to the Borunes that Ce'Nedra's safe and with me, it might relieve the Emperor's mind somewhat." 
"Absolutely splendid." 
"The Algar warrior who guards our rear is Hettar, son of ChoHag, Chief of the ClanChiefs of Algaria. 
"Tolnedra needs me, and no Borune trick is going to deny me the Imperial Crown. 
By marrying me yourself?" Ce'Nedra asked scornfully. 
There's nothing personal in it, you understand, but I have to protect my interests." 
I fail to see it, Baron," Kador said smugly. 
And with that he drew his great sword. 
A familiar blackrobed man rode out from behind a nearby tree on a sablecolored horse. 
He muttered a few quick words and gestured sharply with his right hand. Garion felt a dark rush and a strange roaring in his mind. 
You can sink yourself into its mind if you want, but I don't think you'll like what you find there." 
Get down off your horses," Kador ordered sharply, and the legionnaires all took a threatening step forward. 
Garion stared back at the scarred face of his enemy, alert, but strangely not afraid. 
I knew that sooner or later Belgarath would find it necessary to pursue the Orb alone, and when that happened, I could take you and the boy." 
The others don't concern me," Chamdar said. 
I'll kill him!" Garion said silently in the vaults of his brain. 
"Burn!" he commanded, willing it to happen. 
Wisps of smoke drifted from his black robe as if it had suddenly been laid on a redhot stove. 
Then he shrieked and clutched at his face. 
"Master," he croaked, "have mercy!" 
"I'm going to stop it. " 
Garion!" Aunt Pol's voice rang. 
With a hoarse, despairing cry he tried to cover his blackened face, staggered back a few steps, and then, like a burning house, he collapsed in upon himself and sank back to earth. 
"Still willing to believe only what you can see. 
Why did you call me Belgarion?" he demanded silently. Because it's your name, " her voice replied. 
She had called him Belgarion, and the name had rung in his mind as if he had always known that it was hisas if for all his brief years he had been incomplete until in that instant the name itself had completed him. 
"No, " the voice replied. 
And then the sense of her presence in his mind was gone. It took them several days to reach the sea. 
Barak grinned at him. "It's exactly the same thing," he said. 
We made a run down from Kotu to the harbor at Tol Horb for some Drasnian merchants. 
I remembered that you and Elteg didn't get along very well, so I offered to come down instead." 
What's the world coming to?" Barak asked, shaking his head. 
Greldik nodded soberly and turned to Aunt Pol. "My Lady," he said with a polite bow, "my ship is at your disposal." 
Then they pushed away from the bank, crossed the bar at the mouth of the river and reached the open sea. 
The image of the burning man back in the forest filled his mind. 
I suspected it," she said, sitting down beside him. 
You are Belgarion," she insisted. "Like it or not, you will use the power again. 
You must learn to control it and yourself. 
Didn't you see what I did back there?" 
You stay out of this, " Garion said. 
Wherever he went on the narrow ship, he knew that she was watching him, her eyes calm, speculative. 
It's very hard to stick whiskers back on if you decide later that you wanted to keep them after all." 
"It isn't really hard, Garion," he said, putting the things on the table in front of the young man. 
Garion and Ce'Nedra stood together in the prow of the ship, looking toward the jungle. 
It's not my fault," he said defensively. 
Garion could almost hear the little wheels clicking around in her head. 
I didn't know that," Garion said, flushing slightly. 
"I guess I never really thought about it," he concluded lamely. 
Since his fingers were naturally nimble, he quickly picked up the trick of forming the letter. 
The next day, Greldik's ship reached the mouths of the River of the Serpent in central Nyissa, and his men struck the sail and set their oars into the locks along the sides of the ship in preparation for the long pull upriver to Sthiss Tor. 
The trees grew taller, then immense. Great, gnarled roots twisted up out of the ooze along the banks like grotesquely misshapen legs, and trunks vast as castles reached up into the steaming sky. 
Shaggy tatters of grayish moss descended in hundredfootlong streamers from the trees, and the river wound spitefully in great coils that made their journey ten times as long as it needed to be. 
I wasn't considering it," Durnik said. Good." 
What do you want me to do?" 
Captain Greldik announced that he was delivering the goods of Radek of Boktor to the Drasnian trade enclave. 
The world would come to an end if one of them did," Hettar replied. 
Oh," the guard said, putting away his knife, "why didn't you say so in the first place?" Because I didn't like your attitude," Greldik replied bluntly. 
Tell your men not to disturb her." 
Greldik nodded and spoke briefly to his first mate. 
I'd forgotten about that," Aunt Pol said with a thoughtful frown. 
Undressed, you mean." Durnik's voice was strangled with outrage. It's the custom," Aunt Pol explained. "It has to do with the climate. 
Not exactly," Aunt Pol answered. 
Their perceptions get modified. 
"It makes them difficult to talk to. 
She pointed at a solid building across the street. 
An enormously fat man came into the dim room. 
"I didn't know that Radek was interested in the southern trade. 
He pays me to carry his goods in my ship, not to ask questions about his business." 
Can we speak openly here? Aunt Pol's fingers asked him. 
I learned the language a very long time agoshe replied.You know who Radek of Boktor really is, of course Naturally," Droblek said aloud. 
Shall we stop fencing with each other, Droblek?" Aunt Pol asked quietly. 
All this dancing about is tiresome." 
We didn't think you'd be coming this far south." 
Are they supposed to be here?" So they said. 
How extensive is your network here in Sthiss Tor?" Aunt Pol asked. 
The Tolnedrans are very thorough." 
Will it last long?" Durnik asked. 
It's not all that bad, once you get used to it. It helps if I keep telling myself that." 
Mandorallen stiffened and began to swear. 
Heard of what?" 
I shall not rest until I have bereft that foul baron of his miserable life." Interesting idea," Barak said. 
The chain that bound the slaves together was old and pitted with rust. 
Garion's mind exploded. 
He felt an enormous surge as if some vast tide were rushing out of him, and he reeled almost senseless against Mandorallen. 
Barak looked at the slave, then back at the river. The big man blinked with surprise. 
A tall Murgo stood in the bow, his scarred face angry. 
Why don't you come alongside, and we'll discuss it?" Barak suggested pleasantly. 
This wharf is Drasnian territory, and slavery isn't legal in Drasnia. 
"By common usage, honorable men are morally obliged to defend the territory of kinsmen in their absence." 
I have something to retrieve first," the man in the boat called back. 
The slave had stiffened into an arched posture of mortal agony, his head twisted back and his mouth agape. 
He was beyond help." 
This is the timeright now, Aunt Pol. 
You and I are finished!" 
I've lived in poverty and squalor for hundreds of years at a timeall for you. 
And you think this has all been an entertainment for me?some idle amusement? 
We will go on together until the end of days if necessary. 
Captain Greldik came through the narrow companionway door, his face and beard streaming water. "The DrasnianDroblekis here," he told them. 
Droblek squeezed his vast bulk through the narrow door. 
He was totally drenched from the rain and stood dripping on the Hoor. He wiped his face. 
We hope we can break the fever in a day or so and get some sense out of him. 
Half of these pestilential fevers in Nyissa don't even have names, and we can't really tell one from another. Sometimes people die very quickly from them; sometimes they linger for weeks. 
About all we can do is make them comfortable and wait to see what happens." 
It doesn't hurt to be on the safe side," the big man said, belting on his sword. 
Garion felt a certain relief after they had gone. 
Swirling little eddies of raindrops ran across the muddy surface of the river in the fitful wind. 
Does that sound like a monster? 
If you even so much as stumble, she almost reaches out to catch you. 
Yelling insults at Ce'Nedra was an innocent diversion compared to some of the deadly things he'd said to Aunt Pol that morning, and it allowed him to vent his confusion and anger harmlessly. 
In the end, of course, Ce'Nedra resorted to tears and fled, leaving him feeling more foolish than ashamed. 
Their descent into absurdity had cleared his head. 
A vicious little insect crawled down inside his tunic and began to bite him somewhere between his shoulders where he could not reach. 
He raised his head, trying to look around. 
"You held the cloth to his face too long, Issus." 
Can you stand?" Issus asked Garion. 
His belted robe was stained and spotted. 
He held out his hand to show the blood. 
If you don't do what I tell you to do, I'll cut your fat throat," Issus told him in a flat, unemotional voice. 
"Sadi," he called sharply, "tell your friend I'm coming in. 
The two men pushed Garion into the room. 
Can you speak, boy?" he asked Garion. 
"I've done this before." You're taking too long," the whisper said. 
I'll ask the questions, boy," Sadi said. 
"I guess I'm not really thirsty after all." 
It isn't going to hurt you. Drink," the hissing voice commanded. 
Much better," Sadi said, resuming his seat behind the table. 
Where exactly in Sendaria?" 
They call him Belgarath. 
This is the boy we want," the hissing voice whispered. 
In the corner, rearing out of its own coils and with a strangely flattened neck and glowing eyes was a very large snake. We can take it to Salmissra now," the snake hissed. 
ButI said things I shouldn't have. 
Her voice was vibrant and had a strange, dark timbre. 
On your knees before the Serpent Queen," the snake hissed in Garion's ear. 
The queen summons the beloved serpent," the eunuch intoned. 
No," she said, "you won't. 
Ah," the others chanted. 
"Hail the consort of Eternal Salmissra, most fortunate of men." 
T'he sobbing young man grabbed up a pink robe and an ornately carved jewel box. He stumbled down from the dais. 
"You did this," he accused Garion. 
His heels pattered rapidly on the floor, and his arms flailed wildly. 
He even shed one crystal tear over his loss, but the tear landed on his wrist and sparkled with such an unearthly beauty that he lost himself utterly in contemplating it. 
"Its power is untried, undirected, but it is very strong. 
Sorcery requires will," Salmissra pointed out. 
Love, Salmissra?" the snake asked, sounding faintly amused. 
"But don't underestimate this oneor overestimate your own power. 
There's something strange about it that I can't quite penetrate." 
Her pale eyes seemed to burn, and her lips parted slightly. 
Thirty perhaps," he decided, confused. 
Slowly, beneath the pale skin of her naked shoulder and throat, curious patches of color began to appear, a faint mottling of green and purple that seemed to shift and pulsate, growing first quite visible and then fading. 
Her eyes gloated over her possession of him. 
"That's the one we saw at the harbor. " 
I salute you in the name of Ctuchik, High Priest of the Grolims and Disciple of Torak." The Handmaiden of Issa salutes Ctuchik of Rak Cthol," she responded formally. 
The boy, your Highness," the Grolim said bluntly. 
What need has the Serpent Queen of friends?" 
"I don't wish to become a slave to it. 
So that is it, " the voice in Garion's mind said as the Grolim left. 
The snake's eyes began to shrivel and steam poured from his nostrils and his gaping mouth. 
The quiet voice in his mind, however, was speaking to him rapidly. 
Stop that, you idiot," Salmissra snapped. 
What's going on out there?" Salmissra blazed. 
Come with me, " the voice in Garion's mind said. 
Suddenly he had no sense of his bodyno arms or legsyet he seemed to move. 
A dim shape was there, formless but somehow very familiar. 
Quickly, we have to lead them back before Salmissra has time to do anything." 
Its vast embrace crushed them, and its flailing claws ripped them open. 
The shrieks ended abruptly in a spurt of brains and blood when the massive jaws closed with a sickening crunch on the eunuch's head. 
"This way!" 
"Who are you?" 
He knows that I'm here. 
"I want you to think about your blood." 
To burn away the poison they gave you. 
An image of yellow came into Garion's mind. 
Garion put his fingertips to his chest and willed his blood to change. 
He suddenly felt as if he were on fire. 
"Change it back. " 
Defend thy handmaiden, Great Issa," Salmissra cried, turning to look triumphantly at Aunt Pol. 
Flee now, or face the wrath of Divine Issa. 
Her face is the face of my beloved." 
Destroy her, O my Lord!" Salmissra demanded. 
"What was your name?" 
I was called Maas," the snake said. 
Send me back, Lord. 
My priestess would submit to the foul embrace of my mad brother?" 
"May thy slumber wash away thy grief." 
No!" Salmissra wailed, but the green fire had already died in the statue's eyes, and the jewel on her crown flickered and went dark. 
Her lustrous hair disappeared, and the last vestiges of humanity faded from her face. 
"Behold the Handmaiden of Issa, the queen of the snakepeople, whose dominion shall endure until the end of days, for she is immortal now and will reign in Nyissa forever." 
"I'd prefer to go peacefully, but one way or another, the boy and I are leaving." 
There was no expression on her reptile face, so it was impossible to know what she was thinking. 
No," she said. 
He turned back and kicked the unconscious man in the stomach. 
Garion had forgotten how scantily he was dressed and he flushed slightly and went quickly below deck. 
It had grown noticeably lighter when he came back up, dressed again in tunic and hose, but the gray ash still sifted down through the motionless air, making the world around them hazy and coating everything with a heavy layer of fine grit. 
He remembered the lush overripeness of the queen with a certain regret. 
You must begin your instruction before something disastrous happens. 
If you're really serious about not wanting to hurt people, you should be more than willing to start learning how to keep any accidents from happening." 
I don't like to see him suffering this way. " You're too tenderhearted, Polgara. 
He's what?" she asked. 
Barak's expression grew hurt. 
Did you want us to take your sword and shield back to your son?" she asked. 
Oh, very well," she said with a great sigh. 
Then she took hold of his beard with both hands, pulled his head down and kissed his ashdusted face soundly. 
Brink up a cask," Greldik told the sailors, pounding on his friend's back. 
"Where is he?" She seemed suddenly irritated. 
He turned just in time to be caught in Ce'Nedra's embrace. 
"I can make awful things happen too or at least I could back in Tol Honeth. 
It just happens sometimes. It's not that I want to do it." 
How many more people are you going to have to burn up before you finally accept what she says?" 
You didn't have to say that." 
You know what your problem is? 
You want to keep on being a boy forever. 
Then she turned and ran sobbing in search of Aunt Pol. 
Stop being a baby. " 
You've got further to go than I thought. 
Not too much, " the voice warned him. 
What is all this?" 
The throbbing seemed to grow louder until Garion's entire body quivered with each thudding beat. 
Something came up," the old man answered across the narrowing gap. 
He pushed back his hood and shook the floury ash out of his cloak. 
Wolf stared hard at him. 
"I've had a very bad day. Try not to make it any worse." That last was finally too much for Silk. 
What happened to your arm, father?" 
The ship slid through the oily water, moving upstream against the current, with Silk's laughter trailing behind in the ashladen air. 
He could no longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at lessonsand it was clear that the rest of the school, just like the Gryffindors, thought Harry had entered himself for the tournament. 
Unlike the Gryffindors, however, they did not seem impressed. 
"It's really not that difficult, Harry," Hermione tried to reassure him as they left Flitwick's classshe had been making objects zoom across the room to her all lesson, as though she were some sort of weird magnet for board dusters, wastepaper baskets, and lunascopes. 
He had already struggled through one Friday's worth, with Hermione sitting next to him intoning "ignore them, ignore them, ignore them" under her breath, and he couldn't see why today should be any better. 
It wasn't a pretty sight. 
"Potter attacked me, sir" "We attacked each other at the same time!" 
On the other side of the dungeon, Malfoy turned his back on Snape and pressed his badge, smirking. 
POTTER STINKS flashed once more across the room. 
If only he knew how to do the Cruciatus Curse... he'd have Snape flat on his back like that spider, jerking and twitching. 
"You should all have prepared your recipes now. 
Snape stared down his hooked nose at Colin, whose smile faded from his eager face. 
"Potter, leave your things here, I want you back down here later to test your antidote." 
Harry knocked on the door and entered. 
Five chairs had been set behind the velvetcovered desks, and Ludo Bagman was sitting in one of them, talking to a witch Harry had never seen before, who was wearing magenta robes. 
Bagman suddenly spotted Harry, got up quickly, and bounded forward. 
Harry repeated nervously. 
"Let's see ... ah, yes, this is nice and cozy." 
"You won't mind, Harry, if I use a QuickQuotes Quill? 
Rita Skeeter's smile widened. 
Now she leaned toward Harry and said, "So, Harry... what made you decide to enter the Triwizard Tournament?" 
Even though he wasn't speaking, it was dashing across the parchment, and in its wake he could make out a fresh sentence: An ugly scar, souvenier of a tragic past, disfigures the otherwise charming face of Harry Potter, whose eyes"Ignore the quill, Harry," said Rita Skeeter firmly. 
"I don't know who" "How do you feel about the tasks ahead?" said Rita Skeeter. 
"Can you remember your parents at all?" said Rita Skeeter, talking over him. 
Harry looked around, blinking in the bright light. 
"I hope you saw my piece over the summer about the International Confederation of Wizards' Conference?" 
Rita Skeeter didn't look remotely abashed. 
"An 'air from ze 'ead of a veela," said Fleur. 
"Ah, now, this is one of mine, isn't it?" said Mr. Ollivander, with much more enthusiasm, as Cedric handed over his wand. 
He could see finger marks all over it. 
A fine wandmaker, though the styling is never quite what I... however.." 
"Rather thicker than one usually sees... quite rigid... ten and a quarter inches... 
He handed over his wand. 
Eventually, however, he made a fountain of wine shoot out of it, and handed it back to Harry, announcing that it was still in perfect condition. 
"You may go back to your lessons nowor perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner, as they are about to end" Feeling that at last something had gone right today, Harry got up to leave, but the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat. 
"Eryes, let's do those first," said Rita Skeeter, whose eyes were upon Harry again. 
The photographer seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but Rita Skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging Harry into greater prominence. 
Harry went down to dinner. 
In the meantime, life became even worse for Harry within the confines of the castle, for Rita Skeeter had published her piece about the Triwizard Tournament, and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story of Harry. 
Or is this a school you and Longbottom have set up together?" 
"And I know he misses you" "Miss him?" said Harry. 
"They only like him because he's famous! 
"Come on, please just take off your cloak for a bit, no one's going to bother you here." 
He didn't mention this; he and Hermione hadn't discussed what was coming in the first task much; he had the feeling she didn't want to think about it. 
"She's gone," said Hermione, looking right through Harry toward the end of the street. 
You don't have to talk to Ron!" she added irritably, correctly interpreting his silence. 
The three of them would probably be happily imagining what deadly dangerous task the school champions would be facing on Tuesday. 
Harry glimpsed Fleur Delacour from time to time in the corridors; she looked exactly as she always did, haughty and unruffled. 
Harry wondered why he hadn't spotted him at once, as Hagrid was so large, but standing up carefully, he saw that Hagrid had been leaning low, talking to Professor Moody. 
Hagrid had his usual enormous tankard in front of him, but Moody was drinking from his hip flask. 
Perhaps she thought it was an insult to her mulled mead, but Harry knew better. 
As Harry watched, he saw Hagrid and Moody get up to leave. 
Harry stared at him in amazement. 
Harry crept past them to the portrait hole and waited for a minute or so, keeping an eye on his watch. 
"Bongsewer," said Hagrid, beaming at her, and holding out a hand to help her down the golden steps. 
But it seemed that Madame Maxime was in for the same treat as Harry, because after a while she said playfully, "Wair is it you are taking me, 'Agrid?" 
"Keep back there, Hagrid!" yelled a wizard near the fence, straining on the chain he was holding. 
I've seen this Horntail do forty!" 
Its eyes were still just open. 
Hagrid let out a moan of longing. 
"Just hope he's still fine after he's faced this lot," said Charlie grimly, looking out over the dragons' enclosure. 
Charlie imitated his mother's anxious voice. 
The first shock was over now. 
Maybe if he'd seen the dragons for the first time on Tuesday, he would have passed out cold in front of the whole school... but maybe he would anyway.... 
And he had to get past it. 
After a minute or so, Karkaroff seemed to decide that he had hit some sort of animal; he was looking around at waist height, as though expecting to see a dog. 
"Balderdash!" he gasped at the Fat Lady, who was snoozing in her frame in front of the portrait hole. 
When they had said goodbye, Sirius's face had been gaunt and sunken, surrounded by a quantity of long, black, matted hairbut the hair was short and clean now, Sirius's face was fuller, and he looked younger, much more like the only photograph Harry had of him, which had been taken at the Potters' wedding. 
I've broken into a wizarding house to use the fire, but they could be back at any time. 
You know what Death Eaters are, don't you?" 
And no one's going to look into it too closely; MadEye's heard intruders a bit too often. 
"Exactly... she disappeared in Albania, and that's definitely where Voldemort was rumored to be last... and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn't she?" 
"Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins," said Sirius grimly. 
"I don't know," said Sirius slowly, "I just don't know...Karkaroff doesn't strike me as the type who'd go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort was powerful enough to protect him. 
Don't be tempted to try a Stunning Spelldragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner, you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon" "Yeah, I know, I just saw," said Harry. 
"There you go," Harry said. 
Feeling too queasy to eat, Harry waited until Hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge, then dragged her out onto the grounds. 
"Well, there are Switching Spells... but what's the point of Switching it? Unless you swapped its fangs for winegums or something that would make it less dangerous.... 
The trouble is, like that book said, not much is going to get through a dragon's hide.... 
Maybe to give yourself extra powers? 
"Hermione, I'll see you in the greenhouses," Harry said, coming to his decision as he watched Cedric leaving the Hall. 
"Don't bother," said Cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends bent down to help him. 
Harry looked at him in disbelief. 
He was sure Cedric wouldn't have asked that if he had seen the dragons himself. 
Harry wouldn't have let his worst enemy face those monsters unpreparedwell, perhaps Malfoy or Snape... 
Cedric was still hooking at him in a slightly suspicious way when Harry heard a familiar clunking noise behind him. 
Harry didn't know what to say; this wasn't the reaction he had expected at all. 
"Secrecy Sensor. 
I'm not really in trouble until I see the whites of their eyes. 
Think now. 
"Put them together... it's not that difficult..." 
Only in the last hour had Harry really got the hang of the Summoning Charm. 
Right..." 
"Just as long as it works tomorrow," Harry said. 
Lots of people were watching. 
He heft the Great Hall with Professor McGonagall. 
As she walked him down the stone steps and out into the cold November afternoon, she put her hand on his shoulder. 
Viktor Krum looked even surlier than usual, which Harry supposed was his way of showing nerves. 
And in no time at all, hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet could be heard passing the tent, their owners talking excitedly, laughing, joking.... 
"Ladies first," he said, offering it to Fleur Delacour. 
"One down, three to go!" Bagman yelled as the whistle blew again. 
A pause, while Fleur's marks were being shown... more clapping... then, for the third time, the whistle. 
He walked out through the entrance of the tent, the panic rising into a crescendo inside him. 
There were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands that had been magicked there since he'd last stood on this spot. 
"Accio Firebolt!" he shouted. 
The Horntail's head rose with him, her neck now stretched to its fullest extent, still swaying, hike a snake before its charmer... 
"That was excellent, Potter!" cried Professor McGonagall as he got off the Fireboltwhich from her was extravagant praise. 
"Yeh did it, Harry!" said Hagrid hoarsely. 
"Last year dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school next? 
"Harry, you were brilliant!" Hermione said squeakily. 
Harry knew Ron was about to apologize and suddenly he found he didn't need to hear it. 
Ron grinned nervously at him, and Harry grinned back Hermione burst into tears. 
There were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every surface; Lee Jordan had let off some Filibuster's Fireworks, so that the air was thick with stars and sparks; and Dean Thomas, who was very good at drawing, had put up some impressive new banners, most of which depicted Harry zooming around the Horntail's head on his Firebolt, though a couple showed Cedric with his head on fire. 
"Yeah, go on, Harry, open it!" several people echoed. 
"I haven't done anything to them. 
He put on a highpitched squeak and imitated a houseelf. "Anything we can get you, sir, anything at all!' 
Before he pulled the curtains of his fourposter shut. Harry set his tiny model of the Hungarian Horntail on the table next to his bed, where it yawned, curled up, and closed its eyes. 
"We'll jus' lead them in here," Hagrid said, "an' put the lids on, and we'll see what happens." 
Ron shouted angrily as he and Harry backed into the wall of Hagrid's cabin, still holding the skrewt off with their sparks. 
Hagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was cornering Harry and Ron and flattened it; a blast of fire shot out of its end, withering the pumpkin plants nearby. 
Rita acted as though she hadn't heard what Hagrid had said. 
One of your favorite lessons?" 
Harry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a nasty cut across one cheek). Lavender (whose robes were badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing several burnt fingers), and then to the cabin windows, where most of the class stood, their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear. 
"This is o'ny me second year," said Hagrid. 
I don't suppose you'd like to give an interview, would you? 
"Eryeah, why not?" 
Harry had a very bad feeling about this, but there was no way of communicating it to Hagrid without Rita Skeeter seeing, so he had to stand and watch in silence as Hagrid and Rita Skeeter made arrangements to meet in the Three Broomsticks for a good long interview later that week. 
"Well, goodbye, Harry!" Rita Skeeter called merrily to him as he set off with Ron and Hermione. 
"Worst that can happen is Hagrid'll have to get rid of the skrewts. 
I arose, I settled myself before it, and I gazed into its crystalline depths ... and what do you think I saw gazing back at me?" 
"Okay," Harry said, starting off back down the corridor with Hermione, Ron hurrying to keep up. 
"Wait a minute, Hermione...." 
"Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir, and Harry Potter has come to see him, sir!" 
Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at Harry, his enormous, green, tennisballshaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness. 
Dobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and pointed. 
Unlike Dobby, she had obviously not foraged for clothes. 
However, while every one of Dobby's strange collection of garments was so clean and well cared for that it looked brandnew, Winky was plainly not taking care other clothes at all. 
Hermione frowned at him, but the elves all looked delighted; they bowed very low and retreated. 
"How long have you been here, Dobby?" Harry asked as Dobby handed around the tea. 
"Only a week. Harry Potter, sir!" said Dobby happily. 
'Where is there enough work for two houseelves?' says Winky. 
And so Dobby is a free elf, sir, and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month!" 
"Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters werewerebad Dark wizards'." 
"You just need a bit of practice," Harry said. 
"Oh you is a bad elf, Dobby!" moaned Winky, tears leaking down her face once more. 
A very bad wizard! 
You don't mind maroon, do you?" 
As they prepared to take their leave, many of the surrounding elves pressed in upon them, offering snacks to take back upstairs. 
Hermione refused, with a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying, but Harry and Ron loaded their pockets with cream cakes and pies. 
Potter! 
It was the end of the lesson; they had finished their work; the guinea fowl they had been changing into guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on Professor McGonagall's desk (Neville's still had feathers); they had copied down their homework from the blackboard ("Describe, with examples, the ways in which Transforming Spells must be adapted when performing CrossSpecies Switches"}. 
The bell rang, and there was the usual scuffle of activity as everyone packed their bags and swung them onto their shoulders. 
Harry's insides seemed to curl up and shrivel. 
"That's what I'm telling you. 
Traditionally, the champions and their partners open the ball." 
"I'm not dancing," he said. 
"You are a Hogwarts champion, and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the school. 
A week ago. Harry would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a cinch compared to taking on a Hungarian Horntail. 
"You were supposed to say Harry's a mad delinquent!" 
"But he's not!" said Hagrid, looking genuinely shocked. 
"He'd give her the goods on me any day. 
"Springing a test on us on the last day. 
"It's Christmas, Hermione," said Harry lazily; he was rereading Flying with the Cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire. 
"Want to come to the ball with me?" 
"All right, then," she said, and she turned back to Alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her face. 
Hermione let out a sputter of indignation. 
"I suppose there's always Moaning Myrtle," he said gloomily, referring to the ghost who haunted the girls' toilets on the second floor. 
"I'll meet you at dinner," he said to Ron and Hermione, and he dashed off upstairs. 
He'd just have to ask Cho for a private word, that was all.... 
"Do youdo you want to go to the ball with me?" said Harry. 
"I'm really sorry," she said again. 
"She looked at me like I was a sea slug or something. 
I mean, who would?" 
"Eloise Midgen starting to look quite pretty now, is she? 
But Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light. 
She looked extremely miserable. 
"I think I'll go and have dinner," she said, and she got up and walked off to the portrait hole, her head bowed. 
Ron goggled at Harry. 
Harry waited for them to subside, his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robes. 
"Yeah, that would be great," said Harry. 
"What about them?" she said. 
She smiled even more widely. 
People passing him were pointing and laughing, and a group of thirdyear girls paused and said, "Oh look at the weeny owl! 
"You bring letters to the addressee! 
Pigwidgeon hooted happily, his head protruding over Ron's fist. 
He pulled Sirius's reply off Pigwidgeons leg. 
Hermione whisperedbut your way was better, I'm impressed. 
Keep in touch, I still want to hear about anything unusual. 
There was a Christmas bauble tied to the loop on top of his tea cozy. 
The reason they were extraknobbly was that Harry had been using them to cushion his Sneakoscope for over a year now. 
"Ah, no, Harry, how come you didn't spot that?" said Ron, grinning over from his own bed, which was now strewn with wrapping paper. 
"Dobby is making them himself, sir!" the elf said happily. 
"He is buying the wool out of his wages, sir!" 
The left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it; the right sock was green with a pattern of Snitches. 
There was also, of course, Mrs. Weasley's usual package, including a new sweater (green, with a picture of a dragon on itHarry supposed Charlie had told her all about the Horntail), and a large quantity of homemade mince pies. 
"Who're you going with?" he yelled after Hermione, but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle. 
"Youerlook nice," he said awkwardly. 
Professor McGonagall, who was wearing dress robes of red tartan and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim other hat, told them to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside; they were to enter the Great Hall in procession when the rest of the students had sat down. 
The walls of the Hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost, with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling. 
Dumbledore smiled happily as the champions approached the top table, but Karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like Ron's as he watched Krum and Hermione draw nearer. 
"I've been promoted," Percy said before Harry could even ask, and from his tone, he might have been announcing his election as supreme ruler of the universe. 
Hasn't been right since the World Cup. 
Naturally, he dismissed her immediately afterward, butwell, as I say, he's getting on, he needs looking after, and I think he's found a definite drop in his home comforts since she left. 
And pork chops appeared. 
"Igor, all this secrecy ., . one would almost think you didn't want visitors." 
"Well, Dumbledore," said Karkaroff, displaying his yellowing teeth to their fullest extent, "we are all protective of our private domains, are we not? 
Meanwhile Fleur Delacour was criticizing the Hogwarts decorations to Roger Davies. 
And we have choirs of wood nymphs, 'oo serenade us as we eat. 
Harry looked around the Hall. 
Hermione was now teaching Krum to say her name properly; he kept calling her "Hermyown." 
It wasn't as bad as it could have been. Harry thought, revolving slowly on the spot (Parvati was steering). 
"I don't think that eye should be allowed." 
The Weird Sisters stopped playing, applause filled the hall once more, and Harry let go of Parvati at once. 
Parvati sat down on Harry's other side, crossed her arms and legs too, and within minutes was asked to dance by a boy from Beauxbatons. 
"Oh never mind," snapped Parvati, and she went off with the boy from Beauxbatons. 
Hermione looked at him in surprise. 
"If you don't know," said Ron scathingly, "I'm not going to tell you." 
Who was the one who wanted his autograph? 
How could you say something like thatI want Harry to win the tournament. 
"No it isn't!" shouted Ron. 
People were starting to stare at them. 
"Lost her, have you?" 
"Veil, if you see her, tell her I haff drinks," he said, and he slouched off. 
"Made friends with Viktor Krum, have you, Ron?" 
Percy had bustled over, rubbing his hands together and looking extremely pompous. 
"How do you feel the tournament's going, Mr. Bagman? 
Our department's quite satisfiedthe hitch with the Goblet of Fire"he glanced at Harry"was a little unfortunate, of course, but it seems to have gone very smoothly since, don't you think?" 
I am becoming seriously concerned, I can't deny it _" "Then flee," said Snapes voice curtly. 
Snape had his wand out and was blasting rosebushes apart, his expression most illnatured. Squeals issued from many of the bushes, and dark shapes emerged from them. 
"Ten points from Ravenclaw, Fawcett!" Snape snarled as a girl ran past him. 
Snape snarled, and he brushed past them, his long black cloak billowing out behind him. 
They had reached a large stone reindeer now, over which they could see the sparkling jets of a tall fountain. 
"Momen' I saw yeh, I knew," he was saying, in an oddly husky voice. 
Harry definitely didn't want to listen to this; he knew Hagrid would hate to be overheard in a situation like this (he certainly would have)if it had been possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly, but that wasn't really an option. 
Was it yer mother or yer father?" 
He had never heard Hagrid talk about his childhood before. 
Harry could have told Hagrid it was best not to answer; he stood there in the shadows gritting his teeth, hoping against hope he wouldn'tbut it was no good. 
Out in the entrance hall, Harry and Ron saw Hermione saying good night to Krum before he went back to the Durmstrang ship. 
Cedric looked as though he didn't want to say whatever it was in front of Ron, who shrugged, looking badtempered, and continued to climb the stairs. 
"Tell you what," Cedric said, "use the prefects' bathroom. 
"Next time there's a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!" 
Everybody got up late on Boxing Day. 
It was time now to think of the homework they had neglected during the first week of the holidays. 
He even threw the egg across the roomthough he hadn't really expected that to help. 
When they arrived at Hagrid 's cabin, however, they found an elderly witch with closely cropped gray hair and a very prominent chin standing before his front door. 
All the curtains were closed. 
She and the girls walked slowly forward toward the unicorn, leaving the boys standing near the paddock fence, watching. 
It was an article topped with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty. 
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. 
"That's more what I thought Care of Magical Creatures would be like ... proper creatures like unicorns, not monsters...." 
Parvati had been very cool toward Harry since the ball. 
"I didn't know half the things Professor GrubblyPlank told us about uni" "Look at this!" 
"Iwell, I'm not going to pretend it didn't make a nice change, having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for oncebut I do want Hagrid back, of course I do!" Hermione added hastily, quailing under Harry's furious stare. 
They knocked, and Fang's booming barks answered. 
"Hagrid, it's us!" Harry shouted, pounding on the door. 
"Oh II reckon I've got a pretty good idea what it's about now," Harry lied. 
Harrys insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored them. 
Hermione noticed his tone of voice and frowned. 
He likes it much better here, he told me." 
He gave a short, booming laugh. 
"Well... well, yes," said Bagman impatiently, "butcome on. Harrywe all want a Hogwarts victory, don't we?" 
The smallest of frowns creased Bagman's smooth face. 
"He offered to help me with the golden egg," said Harry. 
Would you call him a father substitute?" 
"She'll be after you next, Hermione," said Ron in a low and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the street. 
"Let her try!" said Hermione defiantly; she was shaking with rage. 
His face was blotchy, his eyes swollen, and he had gone to the other extreme where his hair was concerned; far from trying to make it behave, it now looked like a wig of tangled wire. 
Two fat tears leaked out of Hagrid's beetleblack eyes and fell slowly into his tangled beard. 
Good afternoon to you all." 
Got me the gamekeeper job ... trusts people, he does. 
'Never be ashamed,' my ol' dad used ter say, 'there's some who'll hold it against you, but they're not worth botherin' with.' And he was right. 
"Yeh know wha, Harry?" he said, looking up from the photograph of his father, his eyes very bright, "when I firs' met you, you reminded me of me a bit. 
It'd show them Dumbledore's the one who's got it righ', lettin' anyone in as long as they can do magic. 
The door creaked open. 
His immediate reaction was that it would be worth becoming a prefect just to be able to use this bathroom. 
Harry amused himself for awhile turning the taps on and off, particularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off the surface of the water in large arcs. 
He snapped it shut again, worried that the sound would attract Filch, wondering whether that hadn't been Cedric's planand then, making him jump so badly that he dropped the egg, which clattered away across the bathroom floor, someone spoke. 
"Yeah ... well..." said Harry, bending his knees slightly, just to make absolutely sure Myrtle couldn't see anything but his head, "I'm not supposed to come into your bathroom, am I? 
"I thought I'd better not come back after that." 
He made sure Myrtle had her glasses well covered before hoisting himself out of the bath, wrapping the towel firmly around his waist, and going to retrieve the egg. 
Once he was back in the water, Myrtle peered through her fingers and said, "Go on, then ... open it under the water!" 
He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when a dose of PolyJuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat. 
Harry stared around the bathroom, thinking ... if the voices could only be heard underwater, then it made sense for them to belong to underwater creatures. 
He ran this theory past Myrtle, who smirked at him. 
"He lay there talking to himself for ages about it. 
Trying not to think about Moaning Myrtle zooming down a pipe to the lake with the contents of a toilet. Harry said, "Well, does anything in there have a human voice? 
"Myrtle," Harry said slowly, "how am I supposed to breathe?" 
Myrtle... thanks for your help." 
Yes, the dots belonging to Filch and his cat, Mrs. Norris, were safely in their office ... nothing else seemed to be moving apart from Peeves, though he was bouncing around the trophy room on the floor above.... 
But the dot wasn't labeled "Severus Snape" ... it was Bartemius Crouch. 
Harry stared at the dot. 
It just didn't seem in character, somehow, for correct, lawabiding Mr. Crouch to be sneaking around somebody else's office this late at night.... 
"What's this racket? 
I'll have you, Peeves, I'll have you, you'll... and what is this?" 
This belongs to a school champion!" 
Filch stopped a few steps below Harry and turned. 
At the foot of the stairs stood the only person who could make Harry's situation worse: Snape. 
Harry saw Moodys magical eye travel over Snape, and then, unmistakably, onto himself. Harrys heart gave a horrible jolt. 
"It is unimportant," said Snape coldly. 
"Potter!" Snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and stared right at the place where Harry was, as though he could suddenly see him. 
"Merlins beard," Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye going haywire. 
His eyes were starting to water from the pain. 
"Well, he's not here anymore," said Moody, his eye still whizzing over the map. 
It's been in the Daily Prophet... the Dark Mark at the World Cup, and the Death Eaters and everything...." 
Harrys heart sank; he had thought this was coming. Moody was going to ask where he had got this map, which was a very dubious magical objectand the story of how it had fallen into his hands incriminated not only him, but his own father, Fred and George Weasley, and Professor Lupin, their last Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. 
"You ever thought of a career as an Auror, Potter?" 
He, Ron, and Hermione were sitting at the very back of the Charms class with a table to themselves. 
"Harry... maybe Moody thinks Snape put your name in the Goblet of Fire!"

And, hardest of all, their names I do not know and cannot tell; unless in the chance of a comic poet. 
That is the nature of the accusation, and that is what you have seen yourselves in the comedy of Aristophanes; who has introduced a man whom he calls Socrates, going about and saying that he can walk in the air, and talking a deal of nonsense concerning matters of which I do not pretend to know either much or littlenot that I mean to say anything disparaging of anyone who is a student of natural philosophy. 
And from what they say of this you will be able to judge of the truth of the rest. As little foundation is there for the report that I am a teacher, and take money; that is no more true than the other. 
You must have thought about this as you have sons; is there anyone?" 
"Who is he?" said I, "and of what country? and what does he charge?" 
And here, O men of Athens, I must beg you not to interrupt me, even if I seem to say something extravagant. For the word which I will speak is not mine. 
When I heard the answer, I said to myself, What can the god mean? and what is the interpretation of this riddle? for I know that I have no wisdom, small or great. 
I reflected that if I could only find a man wiser than myself, then I might go to the god with a refutation in my hand. I should say to him, "Here is a man who is wiser than I am; but you said that I was the wisest." 
So I left him, saying to myself, as I went away: Well, although I do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am better off than he isfor he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows. 
At last I went to the artisans, for I was conscious that I knew nothing at all, as I may say, and I was sure that they knew many fine things; and in this I was not mistaken, for they did know many things of which I was ignorant, and in this they certainly were wiser than I was. 
I have said enough in my defence against the first class of my accusers; I turn to the second class, who are headed by Meletus, that good and patriotic man, as he calls himself. 
But perhaps the members of the citizen assembly corrupt them?or do they too improve them? 
Then every Athenian improves and elevates them; all with the exception of myself; and I alone am their corrupter? 
I have shown, Athenians, as I was saying, that Meletus has no care at all, great or small, about the matter. 
No, my friend; I will answer to you and to the court, as you refuse to answer for yourself. 
For I do nothing but go about persuading you all, old and young alike, not to take thought for your persons and your properties, but first and chiefly to care about the greatest improvement of the soul. 
And now, Athenians, I am not going to argue for my own sake, as you may think, but for yours, that you may not sin against the God, or lightly reject his boon by condemning me. 
Someone may wonder why I go about in private, giving advice and busying myself with the concerns of others, but do not venture to come forward in public and advise the state. 
No, indeed, men of Athens, neither I nor any other. 
For the truth is that I have no regular disciples: but if anyone likes to come and hear me while I am pursuing my mission, whether he be young or old, he may freely come. 
And if anyone says that he has ever learned or heard anything from me in private which all the world has not heard, I should like you to know that he is speaking an untruth. 
I might mention a great many others, any of whom Meletus should have produced as witnesses in the course of his speech; and let him still produce them, if he has forgottenI will make way for him. 
I have seen men of reputation, when they have been condemned, behaving in the strangest manner: they seemed to fancy that they were going to suffer something dreadful if they died, and that they could be immortal if you only allowed them to live; and I think that they were a dishonor to the state, and that any stranger coming in would say of them that the most eminent men of Athens, to whom the Athenians themselves give honor and command, are no better than women. 
For his duty is, not to make a present of justice, but to give judgment; and he has sworn that he will judge according to the laws, and not according to his own good pleasure; and neither he nor we should get into the habit of perjuring ourselvesthere can be no piety in that. 
And so he proposes death as the penalty. And what shall I propose on my part, O men of Athens? 
I am speaking now only to those of you who have condemned me to death. 
I am old and move slowly, and the slower runner has overtaken me, and my accusers are keen and quick, and the faster runner, who is unrighteousness, has overtaken them. 
You are my friends, and I should like to show you the meaning of this event which has happened to me. 
For which reason also, I am not angry with my accusers, or my condemners; they have done me no harm, although neither of them meant to do me any good; and for this I may gently blame them. 
I was assigned a small room on the fourth floor of the hotel (for you must know that I belonged to the General's suite). 
"You are too touchy about these things. What I have said I have said merely as a warning. To do so is no more than my right." 
I knew that "Monsieur le Comte" would take no notice of me when we met at dinner, as also that the General would not dream of introducing us, nor of recommending me to the "Comte." However, the latter had lived awhile in Russia, and knew that the person referred to as an "uchitel" is never looked upon as a bird of fine feather. 
At the same time, he was a gentle, amiable sort of an individual, and, even on our first encounter in Prussia I had contrived to draw him out, and he had told me that he had just been to the North Cape, and was now anxious to visit the fair at Nizhni Novgorod. 
In Moscow too, I remembered, he had blown a great many bubbles. 
"In Paris, too, I had a dispute with a Pole," I continued, "and then with a French officer who supported him. 
After that a section of the Frenchmen present took my part. They did so as soon as I told them the story of how once I threatened to spit into Monsignor's coffee." 
It simply passed his understanding that any insignificant Russian should dare to compare himself with other visitors of Monsignor's! 
In a tone of the utmost effrontery, as though he were delighted to have a chance of insulting me, he looked me up and down, and then said: "Do you suppose that Monsignor is going to put aside his coffee for YOU?" 
But I only cried the louder: "Let me tell you that I am going to SPIT into that coffee! 
"Come what may, I MUST have money," she said. "And get it somehow I willotherwise I shall be ruined." 
"It amuses me to see you grow angry," she continued. 
At all events, I confined myself at first simply to looking on, and decided to attempt nothing serious. 
Also. it behoved me to learn the game itself; since, despite a thousand descriptions of roulette which I had read with ceaseless avidity, I knew nothing of its rules, and had never even seen it played. 
For instance, a gentleman may stake, say, five or ten louis d'orseldom more, unless he is a very rich man, when he may stake, say, a thousand francs; but, he must do this simply for the love of the game itselfsimply for sport, simply in order to observe the process of winning or of losing, and, above all things, as a man who remains quite uninterested in the possibility of his issuing a winner. 
If he wins, he will be at liberty, perhaps, to give vent to a laugh, or to pass a remark on the circumstance to a bystander, or to stake again, or to double his stake; but, even this he must do solely out of curiosity, and for the pleasure of watching the play of chances and of calculations, and not because of any vulgar desire to win. 
Best of all, he ought to imagine his fellowgamblers and the rest of the mob which stands trembling over a coin to be equally rich and gentlemanly with himself, and playing solely for recreation and pleasure. 
Again the black turned up, and again he did not gather in what he had won; and when, in the third round, the RED turned up he lost, at a stroke, 1200 francs. 
Though one may be squeezed by the crowd, one must look as though one were fully assured of being the observerof having neither part nor lot with the observed. At the same time, to stare fixedly about one is unbecoming; for that, again, is ungentlemanly, seeing that no spectacle is worth an open stareare no spectacles in the world which merit from a gentleman too pronounced an inspection. 
However, to me personally the scene DID seem to be worth undisguised contemplationmore especially in view of the fact that I had come there not only to look at, but also to number myself sincerely and wholeheartedly with, the mob. 
For example, I noticed that nothing was more common than for another's hand to stretch out and grab one's winnings whenever one had won. 
I found the whole party walking in the park, and was able to get an interview with her only after supper. 
And even if you were to WIN much I should be compromised," he added in a meaning sort of way. 
"That is my sole reason." "Then are you so certain that your rouletteplaying will get us out of our difficulties?" she inquired with a quizzical smile. 
Yet still he seemed glad to join us in our walks in the Casino, or in our rides and drives about the town. 
But WHO was this Mlle. Blanche? 
And add to that his widowerhood, his children, his ruined property, his debts, and the woman with whom he had fallen in love! 
As for the Marquis himself, I doubt to this day if he was a Marquisalthough about the fact that he had formerly belonged to high society (for instance, in Moscow and Germany) there could be no doubt whatever. 
In fact, WHEREVER we were in the Park, in the forest, or on the Shlangenbergone needed but to raise one's eyes and glance around to catch sight of at least a PORTION of Mr. Astley's frame sticking outwhether on an adjacent path or behind a bush. 
The conversation had been carried on in execrable French. 
What had happened to me I did not know; but, before luncheon I told Polina of my lossesuntil which time I walked about the Park. 
Although the General appeared to be taking stock of me, he said nothing. 
"Upon what do you base your opinion?" he inquired. 
None the less we Russians often need money; wherefore, we are glad of, and greatly devoted to, a method of acquisition like roulettewhereby, in a couple of hours, one may grow rich without doing any work. 
I smiled, for I was rather glad to have a quarrel with them. "I would rather live a wandering life in tents," I cried, "than bow the knee to a German idol!" 
It is all done out of sheer rectitudeout of a rectitude which is magnified to the point of the younger son believing that he has been RIGHTLY sold, and that it is simply idyllic for the victim to rejoice when he is made over into pledge. 
We took the children with us, and set out for the fountain in the Park. 
"Yes, something, I believe, WILL happen to him," assented Polina thoughtfully. 
What do you think of it, Polina Alexandrovna?" "Yes, it is very horrible," she interrupted with a shudder. 
I borrowed some money, and must pay it back again. 
"True," I replied gloomily. 
Indeed, what you say makes me ask myselfWhy have my absurd, senseless losses of today raised a doubt in my mind? 
It is because we Russians are too richly and multifariously gifted to be able at once to find the proper mode of expression. 
You are hard upon me. 
"But I order you, nevertheless, to be silent." She stopped, well nigh breathless with anger. 
Perhaps she divined this, and for that very reason gave way to rage. 
I said as much to her. 
"Also, do you know that it is not safe for us to take walks together? Often I have a feeling that I should like to strike you, to disfigure you, to strangle you. 
I love without hope, and know that hereafter I shall love you a thousand times more. 
"I do not know," I replied. "Perhaps I am, but I do not know. 
I desire to see if you were speaking seriously just now." 
VI Two days have passed since that day of lunacy. 
She is tall and straight, and very slim. 
Her face was purple, and the little eyes in it had an impudent, malicious expression. 
Also, he had legs which seemed to begin almost at his chestor, rather, at his chin! 
But I do not remember the details very well. 
But the Baron and Baroness are members of an older generation, as well as Prussian Junkers and landowners. 
The Frenchman laughed aloud. 
The General on hearing of this further intended outrage, showed the white feather. 
"What? " he cried. "Do you intend to go on with this damned nonsense? Do you not realise the harm that it is doing me? 
You will agree with me, I am sure, that at present I ought to move with especial careyes, with very especial care. 
With that he wound up in a despairing voice: " O Alexis Ivanovitch, Alexis Ivanovitch!" 
At once I divined that something out of the way was on the carpet. 
After the Baron had done THAT, I should, for my part, at once feel free to express to him, wholeheartedly and without reserve, my own regrets." 
"I cannot see that the marriage scheme need, be affected by scenes or scandals." 
What are they waiting for? 
"You are labouring under a delusion, Monsieur de Griers. The thing will be done in far better trim than you imagine. 
Yes, you may be pretty sure that the Baron will be civil to Mr. Astley, and listen to him. 
Read them, please, for I must take her back an answer." 
So saying, he took from his pocket a small, compact, wafersealed note, and handed it to me. 
But," I added sharply, "I would also ask you why you have been so long in handing me this note? 
Also, Polina herself had mentioned to me her dislike for him, and delivered herself of some remarkable confessions on the subject. 
I like you, and was therefore coming to pay you a visit." 
"What a splendid fellow you are, Mr. Astley!" 
For an hour and a half did I discourse on the subject, and found it a pleasure to do so, even though this was the first occasion on which I had referred to the matter. 
Now, you have no right whatever to be suspicious. 
Mr. Astley smiled and nodded. "Yes, I think I DO know more about it than you do," he assented. "The affair centres around this Mlle. Blanche. 
"Yet he possesses a good circle of friends?" "Possibly. Mlle. Blanche also may possess that. 
"But why?" 
"In whom? " asked Mr. Astley. 
"Ah, then of course their interests centre around her. 
"I know of nothing else," asserted Mr. Astley doggedly. "But, I do, I do!" I shouted in my fury. 
Good heavens, what a stupid fellow!" came in a despairing wail from the verandah. 
"Yet she will outlive us, and every one else in the hotel. Good Lord! what is going to become of us now? 
Here, Potapitch!" she cried to an old servant who, dressed in a frock coat and white waistcoat, had a bald, red head (he was the chamberlain who always accompanied her on her journeys). "Just think! Alexis Ivanovitch does not recognise me! 
"A fellowtraveller, and my very good friend, as well as an acquaintance of the General's." 
So much did the thought inspire me that I marched ahead in the gayest of fashions. 
Only Polina looked anything but perplexed or surprised. Presently, however, she too turned as white as a sheet, and then reddened to her temples. 
Oh, I know ALL about the telegrams which you have been dispatching. They must have cost you a pretty sum, I should think, for telegrams are not sent from abroad for nothing. 
Une surprise charmante!" "Just so. 
When this De Griers was in Moscow he soon learnt to make himself understood." I explained to the old lady that Mlle. Blanche had never visited Russia. 
"Bonjour, madame," replied Mlle. Blanche with an elegant, ceremonious bow as, under cover of an unwonted modesty, she endeavoured to express, both in face and figure, her extreme surprise at such strange behaviour on the part of the Grandmother. 
You are simply telling lies. 
"Say something, for goodness' sake! 
Again the Grandmother was borne aloft and carried down the staircase amid a perfect bevy of followersthe General walking as though he had been hit over the head with a cudgel, and De Griers seeming to be plunged in thought. 
For instance, on one occasion she halted before a picture which, a poor copy of a wellknown original, had a mythological subject. 
The place is too luxurious for an old woman like myself. It is too large for any one person. 
The Baron was the aggressor by raising his stick at me." 
Upon this the landlord bowed and departed, though he could not have understood the Grandmother's compliment. 
"Pardon me, Madame," the General continued with a sneer, "but are duels really feasible?" 
"Very well. Is there anything else for me to see here?" 
Why, she is only a human being like the rest of us; and as she has been travelling for a week she might like to look about her. 
"Do I see eagles flying yonder?" 
Frequently the old lady would twist herself round to converse with these servants. 
Especially did her favour light upon a very young man who was plunging heavily, and had won (so it was whispered) as much as 40,000 francs, which were lying before him on the table in a heap of gold and banknotes. 
Yet never once did the player throw him a glance as he staked and staked, and raked in his winnings. 
On the left, among the players at the other half of the table, a young lady was playing, with, beside her, a dwarf. 
Do you know her? 
A bird of passage, evidently. 
Besides, I can see that she has her shoes polished. 
Upon this I set myself to explain the meaning of all the combinationsof "rouge et noir," of "pair et impair," of "manque et passe," with, lastly, the different values in the system of numbers. 
If the wheel stops at that figure, everything lying on the table becomes the absolute property of the bank. 
Also, whenever the wheel has begun to turn, the bank ceases to pay out anything." "Then I should receive nothing if I were staking?" 
"Because the number of chances against its occurrence is thirtysix." 
It is not YOUR money." 
"Potapitch is outside, and they would decline to admit him to these rooms. 
The croupiers were making up a heavy packet of coins, sealed in blue paper, and containing fifty ten gulden pieces, together with an unsealed packet containing another twenty. 
I handed the whole to the old lady in a moneyshovel. 
"We shall be too late! 
Sometimes zero does not turn up for two hundred rounds in succession. I assure you that you may lose all your capital." 
I myself was at heart a gambler. 
Wheel my chair away." 
Oh coy crescent do not frown for I am ready to sacrifice myself for you! 
In the creation of the heavens and earth, and the alternation of the night and day, and the ships which sail the seas to people's benefit, and the water which God sends down from the skyby which He brings the earth to life when it was dead and scatters about in it creatures of every kindand the varying direction of the winds, and the clouds subservient between heaven and earth, there are Signs for people who use their intellect." 
The necessary mechanism, or more accurately the miniature factory, by means of which plants are able to carry out photosynthesis, is found in their leaves. 
Even if the plant managed to produce food, it would be unable to transport this to other parts of the body, and would eventually die. 
All of a plant's systems have this feature of irreducible complexity. 
Let us think how the functioning of the most important and best known of the mechanisms in plants, photosynthesis, and the transport systems linked to it, came about. 
They have claimed that from one species of plant which came about by chance, an infinite variety of plants have emerged, again by chance, and that features such as smell, taste, and colour, particular to each species, again came about by chance. 
Whereas when just one plant cell is observed, a system so complex will be seen as could not have come about by minute changes over time. 
And the owner of this superior intelligence, God, the Lord of all the worlds, shows proofs of His flawless creation to human beings. 
Plants, which have a most important role in the world's ecological balance and, indeed, in the continuation of life, possess a relatively more effective reproductive system than other living creatures. 
The best known asexual reproduction method of plants is the modifying of stems and separating into different parts. 
In some plants, such as the begonia, when the leaves which fall from it are placed on wet sand, young plantlets soon grow around the leaf base. 
All the features of the mother plant, based on its inbuilt genetic information, are to be found, complete, down to the last detail in every cell of every little part that splits off from it. 
These are all parts of the system which make up the plant. 
Look againdo you see any gaps? Then look again and again. Your eyes will become dazzled and exhausted. 
Flowers show differences in features, such as shape, colour, the casing of reproductive cells, and petals. 
Their functions are to reach the female organs in flowers of the same species and to ensure the continuation of their species of plant. 
For this reason it is most important that the right pollen should go to the right plant. 
The answer to all these questions will be given when we examine the structure of pollen and the dispersal systems. 
The best example of this is to be seen in pine cones. 
There are specially designed channels on the cones to draw to themselves the currents which carry the pollen. 
Female cones are larger than male cones and grow singly. 
Because, in order to reach the inner part of the cone, it has to enter a special path which leads to the centre. 
Subsequently, the movements of the balloons in this experimental model were filmed using a special photographic technique. 
It is not possible for any living species to perpetuate itself without a reproductive system. 
Many details, such as the direction of the air current, the different thicknesses of cones, the shape of the leaves, etc., have been specially taken into account and reproduction plans built on the basis of this information. 
The complex structures in the cones, which have nearly the same working system as rockets, have been especially planned in the same way. 
And, of course, it is impossible that pollens could have the ability and knowledge to find their different ways on this journey. 
Each and every species has known what it has to do since it first appeared. 
There is no doubt that it is God who is worthy of praise here, who created all living creatures with all the abilities they possess. 
Everything in the heavens and on the earth belongs to Him. 
For example, plants' colour signals indicate to birds and other animals which fruits are ripe and ready for dispersal. 
The animal which is to carry out the particle spreading, generally falls into a trap laid by the plant, and in this way the plant achieves it aim. 
While the the bellflowers give off a nectar which is most attractive to bees, the red cephelanthera does not possess the characteristics to do this. 
While the leafcutter bees are fertilising the blue bellflowers, they feel the need to fertilise the red cephelanthera too. 
The answer to this question came as the result of research carried out with a device called a "spectrophotometer." 
Some species of plant actually announce their pollen reward to insects by changing the colour of their blossoms. 
The same insect will also leave behind pollen which stuck to it from another flower it visited, and will thus bring about fertilisation. 
It is not even aware of the important job it does. 
This species of orchid is even able to give off a suitable chemical signal to attract male bees, and produces an effective pheromone (a special chemical). 
For this reason their modes of fertilisation differ.9 
Under the influence of this smell, the male wasps land on the orchid leaves. This triggers the plant's springloaded 'elbow' joint causing the wasp to fall on its reproductive organ. 
The plant "calculates" that its aerodynamic structure is suited to pollen dispersal by wind, and every subsequent generation employs the same method. 
A plant has no knowledge of its own existence, nor of the miraculous functions it performs, because it is under the control of God, who planned its every feature, who created everything in the universe, and who continues to create at every moment. This truth is announced to us by God in the Qur'an: 
There are sea plants, too, which reproduce by this method. 
Here are some examples of these plants: 
Let us consider these studies in the context of the Vallisneria's position: Unlike the designers of the lifeboat, the Vallisneria did not have more than one chance. 
This design enables the Halodule to hit even more marks than the Vallisneria. 
They are carried along by the waves, then stick to female flowers' reproductive organs and thus enable the plant to multiply.19 
The pollen of the Thalassia and the Halodule being sent out embedded in strands increases the distance the search vehicles go. 
Whether by means of the wind, or whether by means of other carriers, male pollens which reach female flower organs have reached the end of their journey. 
The carpel has a swollen end, called the stigma, under which there is a stalk, called the style, and at the bottom an ovary, which contains the blueprint for the seeds. 
This sticky liquid has a very important function. As long as the pollen grains are unable to reach the ovary beneath the style, they will not be able to fertilise the seeds. This liquid ensures that by making them stick together the pollen does not go to waste. 
After landing on the stigma, each individual pollen, in other words, each male reproductive cell, develops a thin tube downwards, and enters the ovary through the style. 
After fertilisation, the egg is wrapped up in a coat, and the embryo enters upon a kind of rest period, and grows to become a seed with the food sources stored around it. 
For instance, if pollen from wheat flowers is carried to an apple tree, that tree will not produce apples. 
There is no doubt that the intelligence which controls the plant's every detail designed this mechanism in the flower in the most subtle way so as to guarantee the perpetuation of the species from generation to generation. 
For example, in the final stage of the development of some seeds a resistant waxy substance forms on the external surfaces, thanks to which the seeds become resistant to the effects of water and gas. 
The amount of nourishment is different between those seeds which have to last for a long time before sprouting (for example coconut seeds) and those which begin to sprout a short while after coming into contact with water (melon, water melon, etc. ). 
This is brought about by the release of the tension which forms when the seed is growing inside its coat. 
The seed coats of some plants split open after drying in the sun, and others open and disperse their contents when affected by such external factors as the wind or animals. 
Some time later the pressure exerted by this liquid builds up to such an extent that the outer skin of the cucumber cannot resist it and bursts off its stalk. 
If this system began to work prematurely, the cucumber's bursting off its stalk before the seeds were formed would serve no purpose. 
The pod splits suddenly into two halves as a result of the difference in pressure between the two sides, and in this way the tiny black seeds inside are dispersed in all directions. 
Sycamores often grow in relatively isolated locations, and there the wind can give the seeds considerable assistance. Spinning around themselves, helicopter seeds can travel great distances in even a slight breeze.23 
There are about 20 nuts inside each shell. 
Although it carries out this process in order to find and eat the nuts later, fortunately, the agouti does not have a perfect memory and the majority of the seeds are forgotten and left to germinate into a new tree about a year later.24 This harmony is not, of course, one which arose by chance. 
But this does not apply to plants. 
Did the plant devise this system by thinking about it for itself? 
A piece of wood which possesses such perfect mechanisms as to realise that unfavourable conditions will later damage its development after germinating, which knows what it has to do to arrest its development the moment it senses such unfavourable conditions, and to continue its development from where it left off when temperatures rise to the necessary level. 
In this way, the ants obtain something to eat, and that part of the seed which carries out the reproduction of the plant is left buried in the soil.28 It would be scientifically completely unrealistic to claim that ants do all this knowingly, or that the plant arranged its seed to have certain features that would appeal to a particular species of ant, or planned to live in the same environment as them. 
When all of the conditions are just right, germination begins. The seed takes in water from the soil and the embryo cells start to divide. Later, the seed coat opens. 
Germination begins under the earth, then the new little plant heads up towards the light and grows ever stronger. 
For example, a seedling growing in the cracks of a newly built road can actually open the cracks up still further. 
Two factors govern the growth of plants: light and gravity. 
How is it that every cells acts with the knowledge of which region it is to take its place in? 
A shoot which emerges from the soil may not always find itself in a suitable environment. It may, for instance, find itself under the shadow of a rock or a large plant. 
The sprouting plant directs its stem straight to the light which it badly needs. 
This is most important. 
There would be no point in roots emerging. 
If We wished We could have made it broken stubble. You would then be left devoid of crops, distraught. 
The existence of this sort of "pressure tank" system was discovered in trees some 200 years ago. 
All that scientists have been able to do on this subject is put forward a number of theories about certain mechanisms. Those which have been demonstrated in experiments are thought of as valid to some extent. 
If the level of the water in the soil were slightly higher than normal, the plant would continually take in water, because the external pressure was higher, and this would eventually damage it. 
If it were a little lower, on the other hand, the plant cell could never take in water from the outside because the external pressure would be low. 
This shows to us that plant roots contain a balancecontrol mechanism to enable them to regulate the level of pressure needed at a precise moment, neither more nor less. 
It has to establish which of all the elements it knows are lacking in all parts of the plant and identify them as needs. 
Let us ask another question. 
How can he tell them apart? 
Is it possible that such a process should have been carried out in the right way every time for millions of years by chance? 
Which substances go into which groups? What differences are there between them? What experiments or observations are required to understand what each one is? Can the fastest results be arrived at by chemical or physical methods in these experiments? 
Parts of them are essential for our health, and they are all present in the necessary quantities. 
For example, if we had no calcium in our bodies, our teeth and bones would lose their hardness. If there were no iron, oxygen could not reach our tissues, because we would have no haemoglobin. 
But these are needed in quite small quantities. 
Phosphorus deficiency causes reduced growth, browning or purpling in foliage in some plants, thin stems, reduced lateral bud breaks, loss of lower leaves and reduced flowering. 
17th century Belgian physicist, Jan Baptista van Helmont, observed the growth of a willow tree and took various measurements in one of his scientific experiments. 
Let us first look at leaves' external structures. 
This is the reason for plants' turning their leaves to the direction of the Sun, which can be easily observed in pot plants. 
If we look at a crosssection of a leaf, we will see a fourlayered structure. 
The outermost part of the epidermis is covered with a protective and waterproof waxy layer, called the cuticle. 
One of the interesting aspects of the stomata is that they are generally found on the underside of leaves. 
Thanks to this special feature, the plant is prevented from being harmed by water loss. 
Their concave structures permit the opening of the pores, which in turn allow the exchange of gases between the leaf and the atmosphere. 
Since all the mechanisms in leaves are interlinked, it makes no sense to say that one of them came about by coincidence. 
Chloroplasts are one thousandth of a millimetre in size, for which reason they can be seen only through a microscope. 
In a chloroplast there are various formations such as thylakoids, internal and external membranes, stromata, enzymes, ribosomes, RNA, and DNA to bring about photosynthesis. 
With the DNA and ribosomes they possess, chloroplasts both reproduce and produce certain proteins. (49) 
As a result, water is separated into oxygen, protons, and electrons. 
These events, which we have tried to summarise as a chain reaction, are only the first half of the photosynthesis process. 
For this to be obtained, the other processes are fully completed, thanks to a specially planned "special fuel production plan." 
During the photosynthesis reactions, enzymes and other structures with different features and tasks work in complete cooperation. 
The diverse formulae have been implemented for millions of years, with no confusion of all the variety of plants, no mistakes in the order of reactions, and no confusion in the quantities of basic materials used in photosynthesis. 
While all this is going on in the chemical factory, the features of the energy which will be used in the processes have been identified. 
George Greenstein, an astronomer who is also an evolutionist, reveals that this logic is faulty in this way: 
Because it is out of the question for plant cells to plan and think. 
So, in that case, is it a product of a unique human intelligence? 
The theory of evolution claims that all living things evolved by stages, and that there was a development from the simple to the complex. 
We can see the pointlessness of this claim by having another brief look at some of the stages in photosynthesis. 
This truth increases the importance of the flawless structure in leaves. 
How is it possible that plants are able to carry out photosynthesis in these microscopic factories, when human beings cannot do so in their huge ones? 
They attempt to conceal the "Truth of Creation," which is clearly to be seen in all living things by using the most complicated terms possible. 
Professor Demirsoy stresses the miraculous processes in photosynthesis, and makes the following admission in the face of the complexity of the system: 
The number of cells in that part of the stalk which joins onto the trunk increases, and they begin to produce special enzymes. 
Before the leaf is completely separated from the trunk, it no longer receives any water from the transport tubes, for which reason its grip on the place it is attached to grows progressively weaker. 
Who is the author of the design of these mechanisms? 
One of the most widely accepted theories to explain how liquids are sent from the soil to the leaves is the Theory of Cohesion. 
The cell walls of the xylem tubes are quite thick, because water will travel up these as it is sucked up under a certain pressure. 
Let us assume that they did so decide: in such a situation, could the structure in question have come about by waiting for coincidences over thousands or millions of years? This question must definitely be answered. 
When the tip of the leaflets of the plant are gently squeezed, within a few seconds they collapse alongside the leaf stalks, and even the stalks themselves eventually droop into a relaxed position. If whatever is troubling the leafy part of the plant persists, it makes a second movement downwards, which exposes the sharp thorns on the stems. 
THE IMAGINARY SCENARIO OF PLANT EVOLUTION With regard to the emergence of plants, evolutionists claim that the hundreds of thousands of varieties of plants all emerged from one single plant. 
2. Again, let us assume that all the impossible happened and that the cell which is claimed to have been the ancestor of the chloroplast was swallowed up by the parent cell. 
There are a number of influences that would make it impossible for algae to live after moving on shore. Let us take a brief look at the most important of them. 
The danger of drying out: For a plant which lives in water to be able to live on land, its surface has first of all to be protected from water loss. 
Feeding:Marine plants take the water and minerals they need directly from the water. For this reason, any algae which tried to live on land would have a food problem. 
Then to be able to reproduce on land, they would need to possess multicellular reproductive cells, like those of land plants, which are covered by a protective layer of cells. Lacking these, any algae which found themselves on land would be unable to protect their reproductive cells from danger. 
We can liken this situation to a human being leaving the Earth and going and trying to live on another planet, while he has a perfect environment to live in on Earth (an atmosphere, food, gravity, and many other conditions). 
Ideally suited as he is to the conditions of this world today, from the moment he leaves the Earth to go to another planet, he will be unable to survive. 
It is just as impossible for him to go elsewhere as it is for algae to leave the water and start to live on land. 
All of these lead us to just one conclusion. 
When we look at fossils from this period, we see that they possess many features possessed by plants of our own time. For example, stomata, cuticle, rhizome, and sporangia are just some of the structures found in these leaves.88 A land plant must be fully protected from the danger of drying up if it is to live on the land. 
For a plant to live and reproduce, it had to possess perfectly functioning systems, just like today. 
From this point of view, all the fossil plants that have been found and all those in the world today confirm that they have possessed the same flawlessly functioning structures from the moment they came to be right up to the present day. 
They possessed hydraulic systems strong enough to crack concrete, pumps able to transport the water absorbed from the ground meters high into the air, and chemical factories producing food for living creatures. 
In this book, Darwin denied that different living species on the earth were created separately by God. According to Darwin, all living beings had a common ancestor and they diversified over time through small changes. 
How a single cell could generate millions of complex living species and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions the theory cannot answer. 
According to the theory, inanimate matter must have produced a living cell as a result of coincidences. This, however, is a claim inconsistent with even the most unassailable rules of biology. "Life Comes from Life" 
Inconclusive Efforts in the 20th Century The first evolutionist who took up the subject of the origin of life in the 20th century was the renowned Russian biologist Alexander Oparin. With various theses he advanced in the 1930's, he tried to prove that the cell of a living being could originate by coincidence. 
These studies, however, were doomed to failure, and Oparin had to make the following confession: "Unfortunately, the origin of the cell remains a question which is actually the darkest point of the entire evolution theory."105 Evolutionist followers of Oparin tried to carry out experiments to solve the problem of the origin of life. 
However, the synthesis of these enzymes can only be realized by the information coded in DNA. 
Fossils show that living beings emerged fully developed and in a perfect state on the earth. That means that "the origin of species" is, contrary to Darwin's supposition, not evolution but creation. 
For instance, look at the book you read, your hands with which you hold it, then lift your head and look around you. 
So far, no visual or recording apparatus produced by man has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater fact lies beyond all this.

Ancient Alga Fossil Most Complex Yet, Science News, vol. 108, September 20 1975, p. 
His garret was under the roof of a high, fivestoried house and was more like a cupboard than a room. 
And each time he passed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. 
He was crushed by poverty, but the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. 
"I want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles," he thought, with an odd smile. 
The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out of town in summerall worked painfully upon the young man's already overwrought nerves. 
It was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time. 
Trifles, trifles are what matter! 
He had counted them once when he had been lost in dreams. 
He was positively going now for a "rehearsal" of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more and more violent. 
There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the two courtyards of the house. 
"Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago," the young man made haste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more polite. 
"And here... 
"What do you want?" the old woman said severely, coming into the room and, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in the face. 
"Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father's. 
The young man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going away; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere else he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming. 
Raskolnikov went out in complete confusion. 
This confusion became more and more intense. 
I have always respected education when in conjunction with genuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular counsellor in rank. 
His hands, particularly, were filthy. 
But what do you mean by hopelessly?" 
"Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you will get nothing by it. 
"Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! 
So be it! 
And yet, although I realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pityfor I repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man," he declared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again"but, my God, if she would but once.... 
"Such is my fate! 
I don't condemn her for it, I don't blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of the past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. 
But she did! 
I obtained it and I lost it again. 
And Katerina Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushed red, as they always are in that disease: 'Here you live with us,' says she, 'you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.' 
And his wife, too, has a cleft palate. 
Well, then, it's a man of God you don't know. 
Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. 'Semyon Zaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh!' 
For two hours they were sitting, whispering together. 
'To be sure,' says he, 'Semyon Zaharovitch, remembering your past services,' says he, 'and in spite of your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now and since moreover we've got on badly without you,' (do you hear, do you hear;) 'and so,' says he, 'I rely now on your word as a gentleman.' 
He will come in that day and He will ask: 'Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross, consumptive stepmother and for the little children of another? 
"It's not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now," he muttered in agitation"and that she will begin pulling my hair. 
Lead the way!" 
It was nearly eleven o'clock and although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it was quite dark at the top of the stairs. 
There was nothing in the room except two chairs and a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, before which stood an old deal kitchentable, unpainted and uncovered. 
At the same time her large dark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened face, were watching her mother with alarm. 
Marmeladov submissively and obediently held up both arms to facilitate the search. 
"Where's the money?" she cried"Mercy on us, can he have drunk it all? 
This does not hurt me, but is a positive consolation, honoured sir," he called out, shaken to and fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead. 
"He's drunk it! he's drunk it all," the poor woman screamed in despair"and his clothes are gone! 
"Oh, accursed life! 
And they're making the most of it! 
The furniture was in keeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; a painted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books; the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long untouched. 
It's capital soup, yesterday's. 
And I'm sick of it." 
"Yes, I want a fortune," he answered firmly, after a brief pause. 
Shall I get you the loaf or not?" 
"A letter? for me! from whom?" 
That was it: from his mother, from the province of R___. 
It was a long while since he had received a letter, but another feeling also suddenly stabbed his heart. 
In the first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sister has been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be separated in the future. 
I was in despair myself, but what could I do? 
There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. 
And a heavy shower of rain came on, too, and Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an open cart all the seventeen versts into town. 
For a whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came to such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account of the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about us. 
He is a welltodo man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government and has already made his fortune. 
And beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will do, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if there is anything you do not like in him at first sight. 
I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely than I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only remember the meaning. 
So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in every way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that your future is marked out and assured for you. 
When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about you, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing him close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own opinion when he makes your acquaintance. 
Do you know, my precious Rodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr Petrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps oldwomanish, fancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with them, after the wedding. 
She is not writing anything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much, so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for a few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting herself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. 
Love Dounia your sister, Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that she loves you beyond everything, more than herself. 
Hm... so it is finally settled; you have determined to marry a sensible business man, Avdotya Romanovna, one who has a fortune (has already made his fortune, that is so much more solid and impressive) a man who holds two government posts and who shares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, and who seems to be kind, as Dounia herself observes. That seems beats everything! 
And that very Dounia for that very 'seems' is marrying him! 
She is your bride.... 
To be sure it's a matter of business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares and expenses;food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco. 
And mother too, why should she be so lavish? 
Is there sense in it? And let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia's life is no worse than life with Mr. Luzhin. 
It shall not be, so long as I am alive, it shall not, it shall not! I won't accept it!" 
And what right have you? 
And yet all these questions were not new ones suddenly confronting him, they were old familiar aches. 
Anyway he must decide on something, or else... 
The difference was that a month ago, yesterday even, the thought was a mere dream: but now... now it appeared not a dream at all, it had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape, and he suddenly became aware of this himself.... 
This boulevard was never much frequented; and now, at two o'clock, in the stifling heat, it was quite deserted. 
You may as well know that too," he added, addressing the gentleman, "come along, I have something to show you." 
I saw him myself watching her and following her, but I prevented him, and he is just waiting for me to go away. 
Now he has walked away a little, and is standing still, pretending to make a cigarette.... 
"Ah, what a pity!" he said, shaking his head"why, she is quite a child! 
The girl opened her weary and sleepylooking eyes, gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her hand. 
"Did you meet her far from here?" he asked him. 
She only just reached the seat and sank down on it." 
The gentleman heard him, and seemed about to fly into a rage again, but thought better of it, and confined himself to a contemptuous look. He then walked slowly another ten paces away and again halted. 
The dandy followed her, but along another avenue, keeping his eye on her. 
"Hey, here!" he shouted after the policeman. 
Have I any right to help? 
How did I dare to give him twenty copecks? 
He worked with great intensity without sparing himself, and he was respected for this, but no one liked him. 
"Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by means of Razumihin alone?" he asked himself in perplexity. 
I shall go to him... on the next day after It, when It will be over and everything will begin afresh...." 
When with a start he lifted his head again and looked around, he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he was going. 
But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid irritability. 
It was a long while since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once, though he only drank a wineglassful. 
And now he dreamt that he was walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he was holding his father's hand and looking with dread at the tavern. 
But at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the crowd. 
"Take us all with a beast like that!" 
"Why, Mikolka, are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart?" 
She has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years!" 
Six men got in and there was still room for more. 
Two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to help Mikolka. 
The laughter in the cart and in the crowd was redoubled, but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed the mare, as though he supposed she really could gallop. 
And he thrashed and thrashed at the mare, beside himself with fury. "Father, father," he cried, "father, what are they doing? Father, they are beating the poor horse!" 
To think of a wretched little beast like that trying to kick! 
Wringing his hands and screaming, he rushed up to the greyheaded old man with the grey beard, who was shaking his head in disapproval. 
"It's my property," shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft down with a swinging blow. 
She sank back on her haunches, but lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force, tugged first on one side and then on the other, trying to move the cart. 
The blow fell; the mare staggered, sank back, tried to pull, but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on the ground like a log. 
Yesterday, yesterday, when I went to make that... experiment, yesterday I realised completely that I could never bear to do it.... 
Anyway I couldn't bring myself to it! I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it! 
Freedom, freedom! 
At the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out with tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, &c. 
The moment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange sensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothing astonishing about this meeting. 
"Tomorrow?" said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable to make up her mind. 
And she is not your own sister eithernothing but a stepsister and what a hand she keeps over you!" 
"But this time don't say a word to Alyona Ivanovna," her husband interrupted; "that's my advice, but come round to us without asking. 
He passed softly, unnoticed, trying not to miss a word. His first amazement was followed by a thrill of horror, like a shiver running down his spine. 
He was only a few steps from his lodging. 
Certainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, he could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan than that which had just presented itself. 
She spoke as a rule little and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid. 
She has such a goodnatured face and eyes. 
One death, and a hundred lives in exchangeit's simple arithmetic! 
He could never recollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time. 
He got up with an effort. 
"Are you ill or not?" asked Nastasya and again received no answer. 
"Will you eat it or not?" 
He ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite as it were mechanically. 
The needle and thread he had got ready long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. 
Now he had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang quietly under his arm on the inside. 
This pledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and thickness of a silver cigarette case. 
But a whole mass of unsettled points and uncertainties remained. 
But these were doubtful points. Supposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya had come back and was on the spot. 
But that seemed utterly unattainable. 
At firstlong before indeedhe had been much occupied with one question; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily detected, and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces? 
"One has but to keep all one's will power and reason to deal with them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has familiarised oneself with the minutest details of the business...." But this preparation had never been begun. 
One trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had even left the staircase. When he reached the landlady's kitchen, the door of which was open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, in Nastasya's absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whether the door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out when he went in for the axe. 
Seeing him, she left off hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him all the time he was passing. 
Somewhere near though, in the yard, for the door is wide open." 
When he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he had sometimes thought that he would be very much afraid. 
He moved a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have the appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly and without impatience, Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood out in his mind vividly, distinctly, forever; he could not make out how he had had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and he was almost unconscious of his body.... 
Then Raskolnikov lost his head and nearly made a great mistake. 
Seeing that she was standing in the doorway not allowing him to pass, he advanced straight upon her. She stepped back in alarm, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and stared with open eyes at him. 
He felt that he was losing his head, that he was almost frightened, so frightened that if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half minute, he thought he would have run away from her. 
The old woman recovered herself, and her visitor's resolute tone evidently restored her confidence. 
"What is it?" she asked once more, scanning Raskolnikov intently, and weighing the pledge in her hand. 
How he has wrapped it up!" Trying to untie the string and turning to the window, to the light (all her windows were shut, in spite of the stifling heat), she left him altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him. 
He pulled the axe quite out, swung it with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without effort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head. 
It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images. 
It was not so much that his hands were shaking, but that he kept making mistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one and would not fit, still he tried to put it in. 
He left the chest of drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that old women usually keep boxes under their beds. 
Raskolnikov completely lost his head, snatched up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry. 
And if at that moment he had been capable of seeing and reasoning more correctly, if he had been able to realise all the difficulties of his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and the absurdity of it, if he could have understood how many obstacles and, perhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to commit, to get out of that place and to make his way home, it is very possible that he would have flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, and not from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he had done. 
But a sort of blankness, even dreaminess had begun by degrees to take possession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot what was of importance, and caught at trifles. 
"How is it they all make such a noise!" flashed through his mind. 
At last all was still, not a soul stirring. 
For some seconds he listened quite seriously. 
He was tempted to hold the fastening, but he might be aware of it. 
"That shows it's not locked, but fastened with the hook! 
That proves that one of them is at home. If they were all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with the key and not with the hook from inside. 
"What are they about in there!" And he began furiously shaking the door. 
Once more he softly touched the bell which gave one tinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him, began touching the doorhandle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once more that it was only fastened by the hook. 
"But what the devil is he about?..." Time was passing, one minute, and anotherno one came. 
He was just going back to the flat. 
The shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all was still. 
The floor had only just been painted, in the middle of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes. 
If any one had come into his room then, he would have jumped up at once and screamed. 
OneSO HE lay a very long while. 
"Ah! the drunken men are coming out of the taverns," he thought, "it's past two o'clock," and at once he leaped up, as though some one had pulled him from the sofa. 
The paper had come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters. 
The conviction, that all his faculties, even memory, and the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began to be an insufferable torture. 
Burn them? 
"Maybe he's not at home," said a man's voice. 
The porter turned his head for a moment. 
At once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags. 
Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began reading; he was a long while reading, before he understood. 
His head swam and ached with fever. 
He did not want to ask questions of any one. 
No one paid attention to him. 
He went up to one of them. 
He was a particularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye. 
Among them were two ladies. 
The other, a very stout, buxom woman with a purplishred, blotchy face, excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a saucer, was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something. 
Raskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk. 
The latter glanced at it, said: "Wait a minute," and went on attending to the lady in mourning. 
What money?" thought Raskolnikov, "but... then... it's certainly not that." 
"The notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago," Raskolnikov answered loudly over his shoulder. To his own surprise he, too, grew suddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it. 
The head clerk looked at him with a smile. 
You must either pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give a written declaration when you can pay it, and at the same time an undertaking not to leave the capital without payment, and nor to sell or conceal your property. 
"And what if she is your landlady?" 
It was an instant of full, direct, purely instinctive joy. 
"You shameful hussy!" he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice. (The lady in mourning had left the office.) 
He listened with pleasure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh... all his nerves were on edge. 
The assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk slightly shook his head. "... 
Luise Ivanovna made haste to curtsy almost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she fluttered out of the office. 
I am a poor student, sick and shattered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty. 
I perfectly agree with you. But allow me to explain..." Raskolnikov put in again, still addressing Nikodim Fomitch, but trying his best to address Ilya Petrovitch also, though the latter persistently appeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously oblivious of him. 
But a year ago, the girl died of typhus. 
What am I to say to that?" 
He looked a little ashamed. 
"I will dictate to you." 
If he had cared to think a little, he would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like that a minute before, forcing his feelings upon them. 
Oh, what had he to do now with his own baseness, with all these petty vanities, officers, German women, debts, police offices? 
When he recovered consciousness, he found himself sitting in a chair, supported by some one on the right side, while some one else was standing on the left, holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water, and Nikodim Fomitch standing before him, looking intently at him. 
"Did you go out yesterday?" 
It was strange. 
He put them all in the different pockets of his overcoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, trying to conceal them as much as possible. 
So he had decided in the night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to get up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all. 
And what if the boxes were to float instead of sinking? 
There were not so many people there, he would be less observed, and it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further off. 
On the right hand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a fourstoried house stretched far into the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for twenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left. 
Here would be the place to throw it, he thought. 
Looking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed against the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn stone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds. 
Then he seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was in the same position again, though it stood a very little higher. 
Nothing could be noticed. 
Other ideas crept into his mind. 
And what lies I told today! 
I shall get well and I shall not worry.... 
"Why, he lives here, in that house," he thought, "why, I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord! 
"Is it you?" he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; then after a brief pause, he whistled. "As hard up as all that! Why, brother, you've cut me out!" he added, looking at Raskolnikov's rags. 
His spleen rose within him. 
Nothing at all... no one's services... no one's sympathy. 
Now he is setting up for being advanced, not that he has an inkling of anything, but, of course, I encourage him. Here are two signatures of the German textin my opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses the question, 'Is woman a human being?' 
Though who can tell, maybe it's sometimes for the worse. 
He heard laughter, of course. 
"Take it, my good man, in Christ's name." 
It was a piece of twenty copecks. 
He stood still, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was especially familiar to him. 
It left him strangely cold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless. He wondered every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting himself, put off finding the explanation of it. 
He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his heart. 
Undressing, and quivering like an overdriven horse, he lay down on the sofa, drew his greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion.... 
Such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, grinding, tears, blows and curses he had never heard. 
He could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy. 
"You've eaten nothing since yesterday, I warrant. You've been trudging about all day, and you're shaking with fever." 
Then he would be alone in the room; they had all gone away afraid of him, and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him; they threatened him, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked at him. 
But of thatof that he had no recollection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten something he ought to remember. 
"He can scrawl his name. 
"Don't want the money! 
You are a man of judgment and we will take him in hand, that is, more simply, take his hand and he will sign it. Here." 
"No, no. Why should we trouble you? 
"Some of yesterday's," answered Nastasya, who was still standing there. 
The table was set as it had not been for a long time. 
"I must tell you, Rodya, I dine like this here every day now," he mumbled with his mouth full of beef, "and it's all Pashenka, your dear little landlady, who sees to that; she loves to do anything for me. 
He poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat on the sofa again. 
As before, he put his left arm round the sick man's head, raised him up and gave him tea in spoonfuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily and earnestly, as though this process was the principal and most effective means towards his friend's recovery. 
And she's been cherishing that design a long time, but was sorry to lose the I. O.U. for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay." 
But the worst of it is that at that point Mr. Tchebarov turns up, a business man. 
How could I have found out so much except from him? 
And another thing that was of special interest to you was your own sock. 
Zametov hunted all about your room for your socks, and with his own scented, ringbedecked fingers he gave you the rag. 
We tried to find out what sort of fringe, but we could not make it out. 
I looked at my sock then, too, but now... now I have been ill. 
Why did Razumihin bring him?" he muttered, helplessly sitting on the sofa again. 
And take the I. O.U.... it would be of use there.... 
Ah, and here is beer left, half a bottle, cold!" 
And I've been out on my own business, too. 
He began untying the bundle, which evidently interested him. 
Do you see this cap?" he said, taking out of the bundle a fairly good, though cheap, and ordinary cap. 
"Why, nowadays you would cost more than thateighty copecks! 
And it's bought on condition that when's it's worn out, they will give you another next year. Yes, on my word! 
Pricea rouble and a half. A bargain?" 
"But perhaps they won't fit," observed Nastasya. 
"Come, brother, don't tell me I've been trudging around for nothing," Razumihin insisted. 
Why, your own, what the messenger brought from Vahrushin, your mother sent it. 
In manner he was slow and, as it were, nonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; he made efforts to conceal his selfimportance, but it was apparent at every instant. 
"I am well, I am perfectly well!" Raskolnikov declared positively and irritably. 
"I would not disturb him tomorrow at all, but I don't know... a little, maybe... but we'll see." 
Oh, you progressive dullards! You don't understand. 
The matter is absolutely selfevident. 
"Why, he was accused of the murder," Razumihin went on hotly. 
What threw them out at first? 
The door was locked, and when they came back with the porter it was open. 
So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were the murderersthat was their logic!" 
And, by the way, I've met that man Koch. 
"Yes, he is a swindler. 
He makes a profession of it. 
Do you know what makes me angry? 
Do you know the details of the case?" 
"I am waiting to hear about the painter." 
When I asked him where he got them, he said that he picked them up in the street. 
'I've known this peasant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he comes from the same province and district of Zaraisk, we are both Ryazan men. 
And the next day I heard that some one had murdered Alyona Ivanovna and her sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with an axe. 
First of all I asked, "Is Nikolay here?" 
Well, so they squeezed and squeezed him and he confessed: 'I did not find it in the street, but in the flat where I was painting with Dmitri.' 
They haven't a shadow of doubt." 
No, they won't accept it, they certainly won't, because they found the jewelcase and the man tried to hang himself, 'which he could not have done if he hadn't felt guilty.' 
"That's been proved," said Razumihin with apparent reluctance, frowning. 
Koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so the murderer popped out and ran down, too, for he had no other way of escape. 
Reflecting, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs, that he would get nothing in this "cabin" by attempting to overawe them, the gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, though with some severity, emphasising every syllable of his question, addressed Zossimov: "Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or formerly a student?" 
Raskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, gazing persistently, though 'without understanding, at the stranger. 
The minute was so chosen that it was impossible to refuse, and the visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying and stumbling. Reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspiciously at Razumihin. 
Luzhin shrugged his shoulders. 
He made a violent effort to understand what it all meant. 
I am expecting your mamma and sister any minute." 
Raskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his face showed some excitement. 
"You see, it's ten years since I visited Petersburg. 
Ideas, if you like, are fermenting," he said to Pyotr Petrovitch, "and desire for good exists, though it's in a childish form, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands. 
If little has been done, the time has been but short; of means I will not speak. 
"It came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my neighbour and we both were left half naked. As a Russian proverb has it, 'catch several hares and you won't catch one.' 
"I trust our acquaintance," he said, addressing Raskolnikov, "may, upon your recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware, become closer.... 
"Yes. What then?" 
Suppose him to have been inexperienced, and it's clear that it was only a chance that saved himand chance may do anything. 
Pyotr Petrovitch put in, addressing Zossimov. He was standing, hat and gloves in hand, but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more intellectual phrases. He was evidently anxious to make a favourable impression and his vanity overcame his prudence. 
"How are we to explain it?" Razumihin caught him up. "It might be explained by our inveterate unpracticality." 
I don't remember the exact words, but the upshot was that he wants money for nothing, without waiting or working! We've grown used to having everything readymade, to walking on crutches, to having our food chewed for us. 
"But why do you worry about it?" Raskolnikov interposed suddenly. 
"In accordance with my theory?" 
"Why, carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now, and it follows that people may be killed..." 
"Economic ideas are not an incitement to murder, and one has but to suppose..." 
"I tell you what," cried Raskolnikov, raising himself on his pillow and fixing his piercing, glittering eyes upon him, "I tell you what." 
"Let me tell you, sir," he began deliberately, doing his utmost to restrain himself but breathing hard, "at the first moment I saw you you were illdisposed to me, but I remained here on purpose to find out more. 
"How could youhow could you!" Razumihin said, shaking his head in perplexity. 
All he knew, all he felt was that everything must be changed "one way or another," he repeated with desperate and immovable selfconfidence and determination. 
From old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the Hay Market. 
"All sorts of people keep booths here," answered the young man, glancing superciliously at Raskolnikov. 
Raskolnikov crossed the square. 
A crowd of women were thronging round the door; some were sitting on the steps, others on the pavement, others were standing talking. 
He listened intently, gloomily and dreamily, bending down at the entrance and peeping inquisitively in from the pavement."Oh, my handsome soldier Don't beat me for nothing,"trilled the thin voice of the singer. 
She smiled, much pleased at the compliment. 
Life, whatever it may be!... 
"Will you have vodka?" asked the waiter. 
You looked for my sock.... 
"Yes, curious." 
"How do you meanprick up my ears?" 
"You are either mad, or..." began Zametov, and he broke off, as though stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind. 
It was a regular society. They used to forge tickets!" 
They are children, simpletons, not criminals! 
Well, let us suppose that these simpletons succeed and each makes a million, and what follows for the rest of their lives? 
He counted the first four thousand, but did not count the fifth thousandhe was in such a hurry to get the money into his pocket and run away. 
And after I began counting the third, 'no, excuse me,' I would say, 'I fancy I made a mistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand, I am not sure.' 
His fatigue increased rapidly. Any shock, any irritating sensation stimulated and revived his energies at once, but his strength failed as quickly when the stimulus was removed. 
"Listen, Razumihin," Raskolnikov began quietly, apparently calm"can't you see that I don't want your benevolence? 
Razumihin stood a moment, thought and let his hand drop. 
You don't know anything about it.... 
So remember, Potchinkov's house on the third storey...." 
"I shall not come, Razumihin." 
"I bet you will," Razumihin shouted after him. 
Stay, hey, is Zametov in there?" 
"Talked to him?" 
He struck his finger on his forehead. 
She soon recovered consciousness, raised her head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing, stupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands. She said nothing. 
Raskolnikov looked on with a strange sensation of indifference and apathy. 
And why isn't Zametov at the police office? 
"Well, it's a way out of it," he thought, walking slowly and listlessly along the canal bank. 
But is it a way out? 
Shall I tell them or not? 
How tired I am! If I could find somewhere to sit or lie down soon! 
He stopped at each landing and looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing the framework of the window had been taken out. 
"There's nothing you can't find in Petersburg," the younger cried enthusiastically, "except father and mother, there's everything!" 
Come to the police station, I'll tell you." 
"Is the assistant there?" 
'There has been a murder here,' says he, 'and I've come to take it.' 
"Take him straight to the police station," the man in the long coat jerked in abruptly. 
"How funk it? 
He is a rogue and no mistake. 
"Strange man!" observed the workman. 
In the middle of the crowd stood a carriage.... 
"That's just how it was," a voice in the crowd confirmed. 
"Three times it was, we all heard it," shouted a third. 
It was evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who was awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements. 
The lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man's face. 
Make haste for a doctor! I will pay, see." 
Little Lida screamed, rushed to Polenka and clutched at her, trembling all over. 
"You might let him die in peace, at least," she shouted at the crowd, "is it a spectacle for you to gape at? 
The lodgers, one after another, squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling of satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden accident, even in those nearest and dearest to the victim, from which no living man is exempt, even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and compassion. 
"We must take off his clothes. 
"A priest," he articulated huskily. 
Katerina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head against the window frame and exclaimed in despair: "Oh, cursed life!" 
"What do you think of him?" he asked. 
He is at the last gasp.... 
He is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes." 
"If you like.... But I warn you it will be perfectly useless." 
At that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the passage parted, and the priest, a little, grey old man, appeared in the doorway bearing the sacrament. 
Sonia stopped short in the doorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of everything. She forgot her fourthhand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here with its ridiculous long train, and her immense crinoline that filled up the whole doorway, and her lightcoloured shoes, and the parasol she brought with her, though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hat with its flaring flamecoloured feather. 
She looked down and took a step forward into the room, still keeping close to the door. 
He drank everything away, the drunkard! 
Now she flew at him almost in a frenzy. 
That's how I spend my nights!... 
And the sick man was silent, but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the doorway and he saw Sonia. 
He looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter, as though not recognising her. 
"Ah, is that you?" he asked him. 
Don't worry the poor woman too much, she is in consumption as it is. 
He laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of rapture. 
And he always used to bring her presents. But he taught us to read and me grammar and scripture, too," she added with dignity. 
The Kingdom of Heaven to herand now enough, madam, leave me in peace! 
I knew it would be over when I went out. 
Strength, strength is what one wants, you can get nothing without it, and strength must be won by strengththat's what they don't know," he added proudly and selfconfidently and he walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge. 
Raskolnikov stopped in the entry, where two of the landlady's servants were busy behind a screen with two samovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie and savouries, brought up from the landlady's kitchen. 
Wait a minute, I'll fetch Zossimov." 
Zossimov told me to talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me, and afterwards I am to tell him about it, for he's got a notion in his head that you are... mad or close on it. 
"It's nothing, nothing!" he cried to the mother and sister"it's only a faint, a mere trifle! 
You are marrying Luzhin for my sake. 
Don't you see..." the mother interposed in dismay. 
Tomorrow all this nonsense will be over... today he certainly did drive him away. 
Let me act like a scoundrel, but you mustn't... one is enough... and though I am a scoundrel, I wouldn't own such a sister. 
Despot!" roared Razumihin; but Raskolnikov did not and perhaps could not answer. 
And he will slip off again if you irritate him, at this time of night, and will do himself some mischief...." 
Razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down the stairs. 
I am a man because I err! 
"Oh, mercy, I do not know," cried poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna. 
How dare he! how dare he put you in such lodgings! 
Do you know the sort of people they take in here? 
For I speak sincerely and not because... hm, hm! 
No, he is a fool, a fool. 
Though I've been calling them all sorts of names just now, I do respect them all... though I don't respect Zametov, I like him, for he is a puppy, and that bullock Zossimov, because he is an honest man and knows his work. 
Avdotya Romanovna was remarkably good looking; she was tall, strikingly wellproportioned, strong and selfreliantthe latter quality was apparent in every gesture, though it did not in the least detract from the grace and softness of her movements. 
All this gave him extraordinary inward satisfaction. 
Talk any rot you like to her, as long as you sit by her and talk. 
I swear you won't regret it. 
But she won't care a straw whether it's you or I, so long as somebody sits beside her, sighing.... 
You'll come to it in the end! 
But there's no need, it's all right. Don't you worry yourself, yet if you like, you might just look in once, too. 
But there can't be...." 
In wine is truth, and the truth had all come out, "that is, all the uncleanness of his coarse and envious heart!" 
"And... the worst of it was he was so coarse, so dirty, he had the manners of a pothouse; and... and even admitting that he knew he had some of the essentials of a gentleman... what was there in that to be proud of? 
And in this case his rags, the insolent police officer, the fever and this suspicion! 
You and me?" 
Ask them yourself and perhaps you'll find out...." 
He entered looking as black as night, bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it. 
Razumihin vigorously attacked the lodgings, but, remembering Luzhin, stopped in embarrassment and was greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna's questions, which showered in a continual stream upon him. 
"Naturally," answered Razumihin. 
He thinks very highly of himself and perhaps he is right. 
Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening attentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her arms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question, without stopping her walk. 
Razumihin soon detected signs of extreme poverty in their belongings. 
Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed like a queen, he felt that he would not be afraid of her, but perhaps just because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery of her surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began to be afraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, which was very trying for a man who already felt diffident. 
What Pyotr Petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and I have supposed may be mistaken, but you can't imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how moody and, so to say, capricious he is. 
"He has never spoken a word of that affair to me," Razumihin answered cautiously. "But I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself, though she is by no means a gossip. 
"I am sure she was a good girl," Avdotya Romanovna observed briefly. 
"You see, Dmitri Prokofitch," she began. 
I didn't want even to show him the letter, but to prevent him from coming by some stratagem with your help... because he is so irritable.... 
He did say something, as we were going home yesterday evening, about a dead man and a girl, but I didn't understand a word.... 
"Ah, you don't know? 
He had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place as before, on the sofa. 
"Yes, I see myself now that I am almost well," said Raskolnikov, giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made Pulcheria Alexandrovna radiant at once. 
"In another three or four days, if he goes on like this, he will be just as before, that is, as he was a month ago, or two... or perhaps even three. This has been coming on for a long while.... eh? 
You are an intelligent man, and must have observed yourself, of course. 
I will make haste and return to the university: and then everything will go smoothly...." 
Dounia and I never go to bed before two at home." 
"As for you, mother, I don't dare to speak," he went on, as though repeating a lesson learned by heart. 
Vasya, the messenger boy in Afanasy Ivanitch's shop, is better dressed! 
Fancy, we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace you and that womanah, here she is! 
Of course, we exaggerated things. 
"What are you saying, Rodya?" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. She, too, was surprised. 
I've only just dressed." 
But you remember everything!" Razumihin interrupted. 
He laughed, "That's right, isn't it, Dounia?" 
Well, that's praiseworthy, and it's better for you... and if you reach a line you won't overstep, you will be unhappy... and if you overstep it, maybe you will be still unhappier.... 
"Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so much," flashed through his mind. 
"What did she die of?" 
Would you believe it, that awful man seems to have been the cause of her death. 
"Why, were they on such bad terms?" he asked, addressing his sister. 
"And directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be harnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner. 
His face worked, as though in convulsion. 
"But what are you all so dull for?" he shouted, suddenly and quite unexpectedly. 
"Thank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning again," said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself. 
Don't go. 
And indeed everything happening here seems somehow far away." 
If you marry Luzhin, I cease at once to look on you as a sister." 
And the imperialist war is a war for the division and redivision of this kind of booty. 
First of all we examine the theory of Marx and Engels of the state, and dwell in particular detail on those aspects of this theory which are ignored or have been distorted by t he opportunists. 
In these circumstances, in view of the unprecedently widespread distortion of Marxism, our prime task is to reestablish what Marx really taught on the subject of the state. this will necessitate a number of long quotations from the works of Marx and Engels themselves. 
The state is a product and a manifestation of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms. 
"Theoretically", it is not denied that the state is an organ of class rule, or that class antagonisms are irreconcilable. 
But what is overlooked or glossed over is this: if the state is the product of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms, if it is a power standing above society and "alienating itself more and more from it", it is clear that the liberation of the oppressed class is impossible not only without a violent revolution, but also without the destruction of the apparatus of state power which was created by the ruling class and which is the embodiment of this "alienation". 
Andas we shall show in detail further onit is this conclusion which Kautsky has "forgotten" and distorted. 
The question of the privileged position of the officials as organs of state power is raised here. 
Direct or indirect bribery? 
The pettybourgeois democrats, such as our SocialistRevolutionaries and Mensheviks, and also their twin brothers, all the socialchauvinists and opportunists of Western Europe, expect just this "more" from universal suffrage. 
Society thus far, operating amid class antagonisms, needed the state, that is, an organization of the particular exploiting class, for the maintenance of its external conditions of production, and, therefore, especially, for the purpose of forcibly keeping the exploited class in the conditions of oppression determined by the given mode of production (slavery, serfdom or bondage, wagelabor). 
The state was the official representative of society as a whole, its concentration in a visible corporation. But it was this only insofar as it was the state of that class which itself represented, for its own time, society as a whole: in ancient times, the state of slaveowning citizens; in the Middle Ages, of the feudal nobility; in our own time, of the bourgeoisie. 
This gives the measure of the value of the phrase 'a free people's state', both as to its justifiable use for a long time from an agitational point of view, and as to its ultimate scientific insufficiency; and also of the socalled anarchists' demand that the state be abolished overnight." 
Such an "interpretation", however, is the crudest distortion of Marxism, advantageous only to the bourgeoisie. In point of theory, it is based on disregard for the most important circumstances and considerations indicated in, say, Engels' "summary" argument we have just quoted in full. 
We are in favor of a democratic republic as the best form of state for the proletariat under capitalism. But we have no right to forget that wage slavery is the lot of the people even in the most democratic bourgeois republic. 
The panegyric Engels sang in its honor, and which fully corresponds to Marx's repeated statements (see the concluding passages of _The_Poverty_of_Philosophy_ and the _Communist_Manifesto_, with their proud and open proclamation of the inevitability of a violent revolution; see what Marx wrote nearly 30 years later, in criticizing the Gotha Programme of 1875, when he mercilessly castigated the opportunist character of that programme)this panegyric is by no means a mere "impulse", a mere declamation or a polemical sally. 
The state is a special organization of force: it is an organization of violence for the suppression of some class. 
The working people need the state only to suppress the resistance of the exploiters, and only the proletariat can direct this suppression, can carry it out. For the proletariat is the only class that is consistently revolutionary, the only class that can unite all the working and exploited people in the struggle against the bourgeoisie, in completely removing it. 
The pettybourgeois democrats, those sham socialists who replaced the class struggle by dreams of class harmony, even pictured the socialist transformation in a dreamy fashionnot as the overthrow of the rule of the exploiting class, but as the peaceful submission of the minority to the majority which has become aware of its aims. 
The theory of class struggle, applied by Marx to the question of the state and the socialist revolution, leads as a matter of course to the recognition of the political rule of the proletariat, of its dictatorship, i. e., of undivided power directly backed by the armed force of the people. 
The culmination of this rule is the proletarian dictatorship, the political rule of the proletariat. 
The legitimate monarchy and the July monarchy "added nothing but a greater division of labor".... 
Finally, in its struggle against the revolution, the parliamentary republic found itself compelled to strengthen, along with repressive measures, the resources and centralization of governmental power. All revolutions perfected this machine instead of smashing it. 
Every worker's experience illustrates this connection in an extremely graphic and impressive manner. 
The Kautskyite opportunism now prevailing in official SocialDemocracy considers the view that the state is a parasitic organism to be the peculiar and exclusive attribute of anarchism. 
Experience had not yet provided material for dealing with this question, which history placed on the agenda later on, in 1871. 
THE PRESENTATION OF THE QUESTION BY MARX IN 1852 In 1907, Mehring, in the magazine _Neue_Zeit_ (Vol.XXV, 2, p.164), published extracts from Marx's letter to Weydemeyer dated March 5, 1852. 
But this is wrong. 
In reality, this period inevitably is a period of an unprecedently violent class struggle in unprecedentedly acute forms, and, consequently, during this period the state must inevitably be a state that is democratic in a new way (for the proletariat and the propertyless in general) and dictatorial in a new way (against the bourgeoisie). 
Marx endeavored to analyze this experiment, to draw tactical lessons from it and reexamine his theory in the light of it. 
Marx's idea is that the working class must break up, smash the "readymade state machinery", and not confine itself merely to laying hold of it. 
It is interesting to note, in particular, two points in the abovequoted argument of Marx. 
Marx therefore excluded Britain, where a revolution, even a people's revolution, then seemed possible, and indeed was possible, _without_ the precondition of destroying "readymade state machinery". 
If we take the revolutions of the 20th century as examples we shall, of course, have to admit that the Portuguese and the Turkish revolutions are both bourgeois revolutions. 
The answer given in the _Communist_Manifesto_ was that this machine was to be replaced by "the proletariat organized as the ruling class", by the winning of the battle of democracy". 
With the development of class antagonisms between capital and labor, state power assumed more and more the character of a public force organized for the suppression of the working class, of a machine of class rule. 
Having once got rid of the standing army and the police, the instruments of physical force of the old government, the Commune proceeded at once to break the instrument of spiritual suppression, the power of the priests.... 
It is still necessary to suppress the bourgeoisie and crush their resistance. 
ABOLITION OF PARLIAMENTARISM The Commune," Marx wrote, "was to be a working, not a parliamentary, body, executive and legislative at the same time.... 
The heroes of rotten philistinism, such as the skobelevs and tseretelis, the Chernovs and Avksentyevs, have even succeeded in polluting the Soviets after the fashion of the most disgusting bourgeois parliamentarism, in converting them into mere talking shops. 
Dyelo_Naroda_, the organ of the ruling SocialistRevolutionary Party, recently admitted in a leading articlewith the matchless frankness of people of "good society", in which "all" are engaged in political prostitutionthat even in the ministeries headed by the "socialists" save the mark!), the whole bureaucratic apparatus is in fact unchanged, is working in the old way and quite "freely" sabotaging revolutionary measures! 
It is noteworthy, however, that in the ministerial company of the Cadets, the Chernovs, Rusanovs, Zenzinovs, and other editors of _Dyelo_Naroda_ have so completely lost all sense of shame as to brazenly assert, as if it were a mere bagetelle, that in their" ministeries everything is unchanged!! 
The subordination, however, must be to the armed vanguard of all the exploited and working people, i. e., to the proletariat. 
This is very true. 
Once we have overthrown the capitalists, crushed the resistance of these exploiters with the iron hand of the armed workers, and smashed the bureaucratic machinery of the modern state, we shall have a splendidlyequipped mechanism, freed from the "parasite", a mechanism which can very well be set going by the united workers themselves, who will hire technicians, foremen and accountants, and pay them all, as indeed all "state" officials in general, workmen's wages. 
The few but important functions which would still remain for a central government were not to to be suppressed, as had been deliberately misstated, but were to be transferred to communal, i. e., strictly responsible, officials. 
The only thing that does occur to the opportunist is what he sees around him, in an environment of pettybourgeois philistinism and "reformists" stagnation, namely, only "municipalities"! 
Bernstein has been refuted by many, especially by Plekhanov in Russian literature and by Kautsky in European literature, but neither of them has said anything about this distortion of Marx by Bernstein. 
By this one act it would have initiated the regeneration of France.... 
The utopians busied themselves with "discovering" political forms under which the socialist transformation of society was to take place. 
And when the mass revolutionary movement of the proletariat burst forth, Marx, in spite of its failure, in spite of its short life and patent weakness, began to study the forms it had discovered. 
In the same way, the abolition of property in land is not the abolition of ground rent but its transfer, if in a modified form, to society. 
Had the autonomists," he wrote, "contented themselves with saying that the social organization of the future would allow authority only within the bounds which the conditions of production make inevitable, one could have come to terms with them. But they are blind to all facts that make authority necessary and they passionately fight the word. 
But the antiauthoritarians demand that the political state be abolished at one stroke, even before the social relations that gave both to it have been destroyed. 
LETTER TO BEBEL One of the most, if not the most, remarkable observation on the state in the works of Marx and Engels is contained in the following passage in Engels' letter to Bebel dated March 1828, 1875. 
Consequently, when he says we" in the last sentence, Engels undoubtedly, in his own as well as in Marx's name, suggests to the leader of the German workers' party that the word "state" be struck out of the programme and replaced by the word community". 
But he refused to merely accept this obvious consideration which satisfied everybody". 
He continued: "Nevertheless, somehow or other, the thing has to be attacked. How necessary this is is shown precisely at the present time by opportunism, which is gaining ground einreissende] in a large section of the SocialDemocrat press. 
Engels particularly stressed the fundamental fact that the German SocialDemocrats were prompted by fear of a renewal of the AntiSocialist Law, and explicitly described it as opportunism; he declared that precisely because there was no republic and no freedom in Germany, the dreams of a "peaceful" path were perfectly absurd. 
Engels was careful not to tie his hands. 
For such a republic, without in the least abolishing the rule of capital, and, therefore, the oppression of the masses nd the class struggle, inevitably leads to such an extension, development, unfolding, and intensification of this struggle that, as soon as it becomes possible to meet the fundamental interests of the oppressed masses, this possibility is realized inevitably and solely through the dictatorship of the proletariat, through the leadership of those masses by the proletariat. 
In Germany, the union state is the transition to the completely unified state, and the "revolution from above" of 1866 and 1870 must not be reversed but supplemented by a "movement from below". 
Approaching the matter from the standpoint of the proletariat and the proletarian revolution, Engels, like Marx, upheld democratic centralism, the republicone and indivisible. 
Although mercilessly criticizing the reactionary nature of small states, and the screening of this by the national question in certain concrete cases, Engels, like Marx, never betrayed the slightest desire to brush aside the national questiona desire of which the Dutch and Polish Marxists, who proceed from their perfectly justified opposition to the narrow philistine nationalism of "their" little states, are often guilty. 
Of course, there is not the slightest hint here of Engels abandoning the criticism of the shortcomings of a federal republic or renouncing the most determined advocacy of, and struggle for, a unified and centralized democratic republic. 
I have already had occassion to point outin _Pravda_ (No.68, May 28, which was suppressed by the government of Kerensky and other socialist" Ministershow on this point (of course, not on this point alone by any mens) our pseudosocialist representatives of pseudorevolutionary pseudodemocracy have made glaring departures from democracy. 
This is wrong. 
Insufficient attention has been and is being paid in our Party propaganda and agitation to this fact, as, indeed, to the whole question of the federal and the centralized republic and local selfgovernment. 
THE 1891 PREFACE TO MARX'S _THE_CIVIL_WAR_IN_FRANCE_ In his preface to the third edition of _The_Civil_War_in_France_ (this preface is dated March 18, 1891, and was originally published in Neue_Zeit_), Engels, in addition to some interesting incidental remarks on questions concerning the attitude towards the state, gave a remarkably vivid summary of the lessons of the Commune. 
It is precisely this essence that is most often evaded by both professors influenced by bourgeois ideology, and by pettybourgeois democrats. 
In 1891 he saw only the very feeble beginnings of opportunism in his party, and, therefore, he expressed himself with extreme caution: As almost only workers, or recognized representatives of the workers, sat in the Commune, its decisions bore a decidedly proletarian character. 
And, in the second place, it paid all officials, high or low, only the wages received by other workers. 
Taken separately, no kind of democracy will bring socialism. But in actual life democracy will never be "taken separately"; it will be "taken together" with other things, it will exert its influence on economic life as well, will stimulate its transformation; and in its turn it will be influenced by economic development, and so on. 
And from this follows a superstitious reverence for the state and everything connected with it, which takes root the more readily since people are accustomed from childhood to imagine that the affairs and interests common to the whole of society could not be looked after other than as they have been looked after in the past, that is, through the state and its lucratively positioned officials. 
This question is bound up with that of overcoming democracy, with which we shall deal now. 
For Marx and myself," continued Engels, "it was therefore absolutely impossible to use such a loose term to characterize our special point of view. 
Marx and I, he said, had a splendid, scientifically exact name for the party, but there was no real party, i. e., no mass proletarian party. 
Perhaps some wit would console us Bolsheviks in the manner of Engels: we have a real party, it is developing splendidly; even such a meaningless and ugly term as "Bolshevik" will "pass muster", although it expresses nothing whatever but the purely accidental fact that at the BrusselsLondon Congress of 1903 we were in the majority. 
Perhaps I would propose a "compromise" to my comrades, namely, to call ourselves the Communist Party, but to retain the word "Bolshevik" in brackets. 
But the question of the name of the Party is incomparably less important than the question of the attitude of the revolutionary proletariat to the state. 
Now the question is put somewhat differently: the transition from capitalist societywhich is developing towards communismto communist society is impossible without a "political transition period", and the state in this period can only be the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat. 
These restrictions, exceptions, exclusions, obstacles for the poor seem slight, especially in the eyes of one who has never known want himself and has never been inclose contact with the oppressed classes in their mass life (and nine out of 10, if not 99 out of 100, bourgeois publicists and politicians come under this category); but in their sum total these restrictions exclude and squeeze out the poor from politics, from active participation in democracy. 
Marx grasped this essence of capitalist democracy splendidly when, in analyzing the experience of the Commune, he said that the oppressed are allowed once every few years to decide which particular representatives of the oppressing class shall represent and repress them in parliament! 
Only habit can, and undoubtedly will, have such an effect; for we see around us on millions of occassions how readily people become accustomed to observing the necessary rules of social intercourse when there is no exploitation, when there is nothing that arouses indignation, evokes protest and revolt, and creates the need for suppression. 
And, secondly, we know that the fundamental social cause of excesses, which consist in the violation of the rules of social intercourse, is the exploitation of the people, their want and their poverty. 
Instead of Lassalle's hazy, obscure, general phrase ("the full product of his labor to the worker"), Marx makes a sober estimate of exactly how socialist society will have to manage its affairs. 
Continuing, Marx says: But these defects are inevitable in the first phase of communist society as it is when it has just emerged, after prolonged birth pangs, from capitalist society. 
But this is not yet communism, and it does not yet abolish "bourgeois law", which gives unequal individuals, in return for unequal (really unequal) amounts of labor, equal amounts of products. 
When there is freedom, there will be no state. 
The state will be able to wither away completely when society adopts the rule: "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs", i. e., when people have become so accustomed to observing the fundamental rules of social intercourse and when their labor has become so productive that they will voluntarily work according to their ability. 
There will then be no need for society, in distributing the products, to regulate the quantity to be received by each; each will take freely "according to his needs". 
Politically, the distinction between the first, or lower, and the higher phase of communism will in time, probably, be tremendous. But it would be ridiculous to recognize this distinction now, under capitalism, and only individual anarchists, perhaps, could invest it with primary importance (if there still are people among the anarchists who have learned nothing from the "Plekhanov" conversion of the Kropotkins, of Grave, Corneliseen, and other "stars" of anarchism into socialchauvinists or "anarchotrenchists", as Ghe, one of the few anarchists who have still preserved a sense of humor and a conscience, has put it). 
Democracy is a form of the state, it represents, on the one hand, the organized, systematic use of force against persons; but, on the other hand, it signifies the formal recognition of equality of citizens, the equal right of all to determine the structure of, and to administer, the state. 
When the majority of the people begin independently and everywhere to keep such accounts and exercise such control over the capitalists (now converted into employees) and over the intellectual gentry who preserve their capitalist habits, this control will really become universal, general, and popular; and there will be no getting away from it, there will be "nowhere to go". 
But this "factory" discipline, which the proletariat, after defeating the capitalists, after overthrowing the exploiters, will extend to the whole of society, is by no means our ideal, or our ultimate goal. It is only a necessary step for thoroughly cleansing society of all the infamies and abominations of capitalist exploitation, and for further progress. 
Let us take Kautsky's first important work against opportunism, Bernstein_and_the_SocialDemocratic_Programme_. 
As we have seen, Marx meant that the workingclass must smash, break, shatter (_sprengung_, explosionthe expression used by Engels) the whole state machine. 
In this pamphlet, the author chose as his special theme the question of "the proletarian revolution" and the proletarian regime". 
The most varied form of enterprisesbureaucratic [??], trade unionist, cooperative, private... can exist side by side in socialist society," Kautsky writes. "... There are, for example, enterprises which cannot do without a bureaucratic [??] organization, such as the railways. 
Still, I am going back on what Marx said as early as 1852, since the question of the tasks of the proletarian revolution in relation to the state is being raised (1912). 
KAUTSKY'S CONTROVERSY WITH PANNEKOEK In opposing Kautsky, Pannekoek came out as one of the representatives of the "Left radical" trend which included Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Radek, and others. 
The anarchists even deny that the revolutionary proletariat should use the state power, they reject its revolutionary dictatorship. The former demand that the proletariat be trained for revolution by utilizing the present state. 
Centralism is possible with both the old and the new state machine. 
By skipping to the question of "opposition", Kautksy substitutes the opportunist for the revolutionary point of view. 
In reality, the trade unions did not develop "in absolute freedom" but in absolute capitalist slavery, under which, it goes without saying, a number of concessions to the prevailing evil, violence, falsehood, exclusion of the poor from the affairs of "higher" administration, cannot be done without". 
"We must not even think of destroying the old state machine; how can we do without ministries and officials>" argues the opportunist, who is completely saturated with philistinism and who, at bottom, not only does not believe in revolution, in the creative power of revolution, but lives in mortal dread of it (like our Mensheviks and SocialistRevolutionaries). 
All these gentry, who play a tremendous, very often a predominant role in the parliamentary work and the press of their parties, repudiate outright the dictatorship of the proletariat and pursue a policy of undisguised opportunism. 
The distortion and hushing up of the question of the relation of the proletarian revolution to the state could not but play an immense role at a time when states, which possess a military apparatus expanded as a consequence of imperialist rivalry, have become military monsters which are exterminating millions of people in order to settle the issue as to whether Britain or Germanythis or that finance capitalis to rule the world. chapter VII THE EXPERIENCE OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTIONS OF 1905 AND 1917 The subject indicated in the title of this chapter is so vast that volumes could be written about it. 
I had already drawn up the plan for the next, the seventh chapter, "The Experience of the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and 1917". 
All the same, Mr. Fleurant, it is not enough to be civil, you must also be reasonable, and not plunder sick people. 
"Item, on the 26th, a carminative clyster to cure the flatulence of Mr. Argan, thirty sous." 
Ah! you jade, you wretch! 
Alas! judging by the manner in which he speaks, is it possible that he is not telling the truth? TOI. 
So, from what I see, daughter, there is no need of my asking you if you are willing to marry. 
The excellent creature has her reasons. ARG. She would not consent to this marriage; but I carried the day, and my word is given. TOI. (_to_ ARGAN). 
How! have you seen him then? 
But I have need of them. Besides, the match is more advantageous than you think. Mr. Diafoirus has only this son for his heir; and, moreover, Mr. Purgon, who has neither wife nor child, gives all he has in favour of this marriage; and Mr. Purgon is a man worth eight thousand francs a year. 
TOI. What a lot of people he must have killed to have become so rich! ARG. 
Don't speak like that? 
People will say all they like, but I tell you that I will have her make my promise good. 
You will not shut her up in a convent. 
And who will hinder me? 
You will never have the heart to do it. 
Ah! come near, my wife. 
What ails you, my poor, dear husband? 
What is the matter, my little darling child? 
She has put me in a rage, my dove. 
She is the cause of all my bile. 
We are obliged to put up at times with their bad qualities on account of their good ones. 
TOI. (_in a soft tone_). 
The only settlement that man and wife can make on each other is by mutual donation while they are alive, and even then there must be no children from either that marriage or from any previous marriage at the decease of the first who dies. 
My dear wifey! BEL. Life would be nothing to me. 
You see, Toinette, to what violence it is subjected. 
He looks very bad, and it is only impertinent folks who say that he is better; he never was so ill in his life. 
He walks, sleeps, eats, and drinks, like other folks, but that does not hinder him from being very ill. 
No, make her come here. 
He cannot give her a good lesson if they are not left alone. 
And assure you.... ARG. 
The first gave me birth; but you have chosen me. 
It is not to my wife, but to my daughter, that you are speaking. 
Where is she? ARG. She will soon come. 
With the permission of this gentleman, I invite you to come one of these days to amuse yourself by assisting at the dissection of a woman upon whose body I am to give lectures. 
There are some who give the pleasure of seeing a play to their ladylove; but a dissection is much more gallant. 
It is really nothing but a small extempore opera, and what you will hear is only rhythmical prose or a kind of irregular verse, such as passion and necessity make two people utter. 
Alas! says he to himself, can any one be capable of insulting such charms? 
Phyllis, too sharp a pain you bid me bear; Break this stern silence, tell me what to fear; Disclose your thoughts, and bid them open lie To tell me if I live or die. 
Ah! ah! and where are the words that you have just sung? 
Come, my daughter, shake hands with this gentleman, and pledge him your troth. 
Pretences are not necessary in our age; and when a marriage pleases us, we know very well how to go to it without being dragged by force. 
In what does not regard the possession of her, _concedo_; but in what regards it, _nego_. TOI. (to ANGÉLIQUE). 
Gentlemen, I beg your pardon for all this. 
We all have our own end in marrying. 
Ah! the brazenfaced girl! (_Alone_.) 
LOU. (_throwing herself on her knees_). 
Ah! villainous rod! 
My dear little Louison! 
LOU. Then sister came. ARG. 
And then? 
LOU. Then he kept on kissing her hands. ARG. 
Here is my little finger, which says something though. (_Putting his finger up to his ear_.) 
Well, well, we will talk of business byandby. 
Waste not your years in bootless strife, Till age upon your bodies creep. But now, when shines the kindly light, Give up your soul to love's delight. 
It is she who does all the harm, and everybody is against her. 
No, brother; let us leave that alone. She is a woman with the best intentions in the world for the good of your family, and is free from all interested motives. She expresses for you the most extraordinary tenderness, and shows towards your children an inconceivable goodness. 
Your Mr. Purgon has no wish to deceive; he is a thorough doctor from head to foot, a man who believes in his rules more than in all the demonstrations of mathematics, and who would think it a crime to question them. 
He sees nothing obscure in physic, nothing doubtful, nothing difficult, and through an impetuous prepossession, an obstinate confidence, a coarse common sense and reason, orders right and left purgatives and bleedings, and hesitates at nothing. 
When a doctor speaks to us of assisting, succouring nature, of removing what is injurious to it, of giving it what it is defective in, of restoring it, and giving back to it the full exercise of its functions, when he speaks of purifying the blood, of refreshing the bowels and the brain, of correcting the spleen, of rebuilding the lungs, of renovating the liver, of fortifying the heart, of reestablishing and keeping up the natural heat, and of possessing secrets wherewith to lengthen life of many yearshe repeats to you the romance of physic. 
Your Molière is a fine impertinent fellow with his comedies! 
He has his reasons for not wishing to have anything to do with them; he is certain that only strong and robust constitutions can bear their remedies in addition to the illness, and he has only just enough strength for his sickness. 
It is easy to speak against medicine when one is in perfect health. 
And which was to work a marvellous effect on the intestines. 
I must now tell you that I give you up to your bad constitution, to the imtemperament of your intestines, to the corruption of your blood, to the acrimony of your bile, and to the feculence of your humours. 
I feel already that the faculty is avenging itself. 
I must acknowledge that you are greatly infatuated, and that you look at things with strange eyes. 
The lungs. 
Do you eat your food with appetite? 
ARG. He orders me soup. TOI. 
Why? 
You have also a right eye that I would have plucked out if I were in your place. 
Believe me; have it plucked out as soon as possible; you will see all the clearer with the left eye. 
Just ask her all the caresses she lavishes for me. TOI. Yes, indeed! 
And all the uneasiness my sickness causes her. 
Ah heavens! 
Alas! yes; the poor soul is gone. 
He has just breathed his last in my arms. 
Toinette, you must help me to carry out my design; and you may depend upon it that I will make it worth your while if you serve me. 
Since, by good luck, nobody is aware of his death, let us put him into his bed, and keep the secret until I have done what I want. 
There are some papers and some money I must possess myself of. It is not right that I should have passed the best years of my life with him without any kind of advantage. 
So, my wife, it is thus you love me? 
It is not a bad thing to try; and since you have begun, you will be able by this means to know the sentiments of your family towards you. 
TOI. Your father is dead. ANG. 
ARG. (_kissing_ ANGÉLIQUE). Ah! my daughter! 
There is no disease bold enough to dare to attack the person of a doctor. 
Yes; you have only to hold forth; when you have a cap and gown, any stuff becomes learned, and all rubbish good sense. 
What is it yon intend to do, and what do you mean by this body of physicians? TOI. 
Morpheus, the line was traced. 
Follow the white rabbit. 
I know. 
It's her fault. 
My computer, it... 
What do you think, Dujour? 
I know a lot about you. 
You have a problem with authority, Mr. Anderson. 
The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson. 
Right now? 
In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson......program writer for a respectable software company. 
We know that you've been contacted by a certain......individual. 
If they knew what I know......you would probably be dead. 
What is happening to me? 
Stop the car. 
You know exactly where it ends. 
And I know that's not where you want to be. 
Lift up your shirt. 
It's on the move. 
Clear! 
You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees......because he's expecting to wake up. 
Do you want to know......what it is? 
Follow me. 
This can't be. 
It's cold. 
Tank, we'll need a signal soon. 
We've done it, Trinity. 
This is the core......where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the Matrix. 
If you're talking about what you can feel......what you can smell, taste and see......then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain. 
After he died......the Oracle prophesied his return......and that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix......end the war......bring freedom to our people. 
How about......combat training? 
His neurokinetics are way above normal. 
You're faster than this. 
The Matrix is a system, Neo. 
Because of that......they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be. 
A killing machine designed for one thing. 
Sorry. 
Do you always look at it encoded? 
You know......I know what you're thinking. 
What a mind job. 
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan? 
Nothing. 
Like an actor. 
Take chicken, for example. 
To deny our own impulses......is to deny the very thing that makes us human. 
Everyone, please observe......the fasten seat belt and no smoking signs are on. 
So is this the same oracle that made......the prophecy? 
Do not try and bend the spoon. 
Instead, only try to realize the truth. 
Not too bright, though. 
You just know it......through and through. 
But you already know what I'm going to tell you. 
Are you sure you want to hear this? 
He believes it so blindly......that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours. 
What is that? 
A black cat went past us......then another just like it. 
Get out! 
We're trapped. 
They'll be able to track it. 
We have no choice. 
Got it! 
They're on the eighth floor. 
Is Morpheus alive? 
I'm tired of this war......tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship......of being cold, of eating the same goddamn goop every day. 
God, I wish I could be there......when they break you. 
If Morpheus was right......there's no way I can pull this plug. 
Did you know that the first Matrix......was designed to be a perfect human world where none suffered......where everyone would be happy. 
So the perfect world was a dream......that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. 
They're breaking into his mind. It's like hacking a computer. 
When it does, he'll tell them anything they want to know. 
We'll miss you always. 
She told me this would happen. 
She told me that I would have to make a choice. 
Morpheus believed something, and he was ready to give his life for it. 
Morpheus means more to me than he does to you. 
Every mammal on this planet......instinctively develops an equilibrium with the surrounding environment. 
Human beings are a disease. 
They're coming for you. 
If there is such a thing. 
Please remove any metallic items you're carrying. 
What is he doing? 
You can't be......because I love you. 
Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you. 
Robert, has it occurred to you that every television in France is probably getting ready to broadcast our pictures? 
Is this man a good enough friend?" Sophie asked. 
Robert," Sophie asked, "you're certain we can trust this man?" 
"More than my grandfather?" 
Sophie turned with an incredulous look. 
"Teabing is quite a character. 
He waited there, awkwardly prone, while a telephone began ringing over the small speaker. 
This is Robert Langdon," Langdon called out, sprawled across Sophie's lap. 
Then I'm sure he will be pleased to receive you in the morning." 
Your second question. 
"I think the British take milk." Milk," Langdon said. 
What do you need me to do, sir?" 
Vernet was silent for several seconds. 
Rather than driving to the front door, Langdon pulled into a parking area nestled in the evergreens. 
We probably shouldn't leave it out here, but if Leigh sees it, he'll certainly want to know what it is." 
He looked to be about fifty, with refined features and an austere expression that left little doubt he was unamused by their presence here. 
May I take your coat?" 
Thank you, I'm fine." 
Then, shaking out his jacket, he put it back on, smoothed the lapels, and smiled at Sophie as he sat down directly over the stashed treasure. 
Beneath the Egyptian goddess, inside the fireplace, two stone gargoyles served as andirons, their mouths gaping to reveal their menacing hollow throats. 
And that's where they get the silly name gargoyles.' " Sophie had never again been afraid. 
The fond memory caused Sophie a pang of sadness as the harsh reality of the murder gripped her again. 
An honor." Teabing moved into the light. Thank you for having us," Sophie said, now seeing the man wore metal leg braces and used crutches. 
My only carnal pleasures these days seem to be culinary." 
You arrive on my doorstep unannounced in the middle of the night speaking of the Grail. 
So this is indeed about the Grail. 
You say you come with information? 
Teabing wagged his finger. 
"I was hoping you would be kind enough to explain to Ms. Neveu the true nature of the Holy Grail." 
I fear that is a question I may never answer." 
Sophie read the words. 
As the prophesied Messiah, Jesus toppled kings, inspired millions, and founded new philosophies. 
Understandably, His life was recorded by thousands of followers across the land." Teabing paused to sip his tea and then placed the cup back on the mantel. 
The Bible, as we know it today, was collated by the pagan Roman emperor Constantine the Great." 
"Don't get a symbologist started on Christian icons. 
"Stay with me. 
Sophie had heard of it only insofar as its being the birthplace of the Nicene Creed. 
Sophie glanced at Langdon, and he gave her a soft nod of concurrence. 
Why would they?" Teabing countered. 
Jesus was indeed a great and powerful man. 
Teabing paused, eyeing Sophie. 
And, of course, the Coptic Scrolls in 1945 at Nag Hammadi. 
The scrolls highlight glaring historical discrepancies and fabrications, clearly confirming that the modern Bible was compiled and edited by men who possessed a political agenda—to promote the divinity of the man Jesus Christ and use His influence to solidify their own power base." 
Teabing reached for the book and flipped toward the center. 
"One cup," she said. 
Teabing sighed. 
The Holy Grail is not a thing. 
"Sophie, are you familiar with the modern icons for male and female?" 
"This icon is formally known as the blade, and it represents aggression and manhood. 
Langdon looked directly at her now. 
But the Grail's description as a chalice is actually an allegory to protect the true nature of the Holy Grail. 
Langdon smiled. 
It was man, not God, who created the concept of 'original sin,' whereby Eve tasted of the apple and caused the downfall of the human race. 
Sophie shook her head. 
Sophie looked overwhelmed. 
They claimed Langdon and Neveu had arrived earlier and were turned away from the bank because they did not have proper account identification. 
Does Captain Fache know?" 
Collet took down the address and jumped in his car. 
I will not leave this house without the keystone, he vowed. 
Teabing's "study" was like no study Sophie had ever seen. 
The individual had flowing red hair, delicate folded hands, and the hint of a bosom. 
Therefore, any gospels that described earthly aspects of Jesus' life had to be omitted from the Bible. 
"More specifically, her marriage to Jesus Christ." 
Even before Teabing traced the contour for her, Sophie saw it—the indisputable V shape at the focal point of the painting. 
It was the same symbol Langdon had drawn earlier for the Grail, the chalice, and the female womb. 
"Conspiracy theorists will tell you it stands for Matrimonio or Mary Magdalene. 
"Moreover, Jesus as a married man makes infinitely more sense than our standard biblical view of Jesus as a bachelor." 
Teabing flipped through the book and pointed out several other passages that, to Sophie's surprise, clearly suggested Magdalene and Jesus had a romantic relationship. 
Sir Leigh Teabing was still talking. 
The woman they are speaking of," Teabing explained, "is Mary Magdalene. 
As a result, Peter expresses his discontent over playing second fiddle to a woman. 
And Peter had a problem with that," Langdon said, pointing to The Last Supper. "That's Peter there. 
In the painting, Peter was leaning menacingly toward Mary Magdalene and slicing his bladelike hand across her neck. 
"Is that hand wielding a dagger?" 
Sophie could now see the title of the family tree. 
By marrying into the powerful House of Benjamin, Jesus fused two royal bloodlines, creating a potent political union with the potential of making a legitimate claim to the throne and restoring the line of kings as it was under Solomon." 
Mary Magdalene carried the royal bloodline of Jesus Christ? 
The royal bloodline of Jesus Christ is the source of the most enduring legend of all time—the Holy Grail. 
Her story is everywhere once you open your eyes." 
And the Sangreal documents?" Sophie said. 
You had an urgent phone message about half an hour ago." Yes?" 
The receptionist shrugged it off. 
Aringarosa had a chartered turbo prop awaiting him here for the short flight to France. 
After a long wait, another man came on, his tone gruff and concerned. 
The Holy Grail is Mary Magdalene... the mother of the royal bloodline of Jesus Christ. 
Sophie tilted her head and scanned the list of titles: THE TEMPLAR REVELATION: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ THE WOMAN WITH THE ALABASTER JAR: Mary Magdalene and the Holy Grail THE GODDESS IN THE GOSPELS Reclaiming the Sacred Feminine Here is perhaps the bestknown tome," Teabing said, pulling a tattered hardcover from the stack and handing it to her. 
He looked back at Sophie. 
"And that Mary Magdalene was the womb that carried His royal lineage. 
The Sangreal documents include tens of thousands of pages of information. 
"Why wouldn't Jesus have kept a chronicle of His ministry? 
The documents that have been the object of countless Grail quests throughout history." 
Yes, but the brotherhood had another, more important duty as well—to protect the bloodline itself. 
Many of the Vatican's Grail quests here were in fact stealth missions to erase members of the royal bloodline. 
Stabbed in the eye while sleeping?" 
Assassinated by the Vatican in collusion with Pepin d'Heristal. Late seventh century. 
Teabing rolled his eyes and looked at Langdon and Sophie. 
Rémy, you realize your steak au poivre is the only reason you still work for me." 
Sophie wasn't sure whether to feel relieved or disappointed. 
Only two direct lines of Merovingians remain. 
They are not coming back. 
Everyone has. 
When the Church outlawed speaking of the shunned Mary Magdalene, her story and importance had to be passed on through more discreet channels... channels that supported metaphor and symbolism." 
Langdon held up his Mickey Mouse watch and told her that Walt Disney had made it his quiet life's work to pass on the Grail story to future generations. 
Nor did one need a background in symbolism to understand that Snow White—a princess who fell from grace after partaking of a poisoned apple—was a clear allusion to the downfall of Eve in the Garden of Eden. 
Or that Sleeping Beauty's Princess Aurora—codenamed "Rose" and hidden deep in the forest to protect her from the clutches of the evil witch—was the Grail story for children. 
The clicking of Teabing's crutches approached in the hallway, his pace unusually brisk. 
The manservant had appeared now, standing behind Teabing in the study doorway, his arms crossed. 
"We have information about the clef de voûte. 
And the glass doors were quickly closed. Now, as he huddled in the shadows, Silas peered through the glass. 
Grand Master?" Teabing choked, eyeing Sophie. 
But Grand Master, you say? It's hard to fathom." 
Mr. Saunière was dying when he passed on the information," Langdon said. 
He didn't need options," Teabing argued. 
Look at me, I have been researching them for decades, and I can't even name one Priory member. 
"It sounds like a wellplanned décapiter. 
Certainly treasure hunters have killed for less." 
But what about the rest of the world? 
Those who look at Church scandals and ask, who are these men who claim to speak the truth about Christ and yet lie to cover up the sexual abuse of children by their own priests?" 
The Priory keeps the Sangreal documents hidden. 
Either scenario explains how the Church might be motivated to launch a preemptive attack against the Priory." 
Teabing took the key and studied it. 
"We visited the bank." 
We have a duty to protect it. What if there are other keys? 
"Why didn't someone tell me we had a lead on Langdon?" 
"The estate belongs to a British national named Teabing. 
I have him staked out. 
Collet was fairly certain something else was going on here. 
He handed Collet a pair of night vision binoculars. "The grove of trees near the top of the driveway." 
He thought of the armored truck driver he had stopped at the roadblock. 
His impatience to leave. 
Incredulous, Collet realized that someone in the bank had actually lied to DCPJ about Langdon and Sophie's whereabouts and then helped them escape. 
Hundreds of miles to the south, a chartered Beechcraft Baron 58 raced northward over the Tyrrhenian Sea. 
Closing his eyes, Aringarosa said a prayer that Bezu Fache would have the means to fix it. 
For years he had traveled to cathedrals and churches all over France, paying for special access, examining hundreds of archways beneath rose windows, searching for an encrypted keystone. 
He could hear the ancient words... the foundation of the Grail legend: Vous ne trouvez pas le SaintGraal, c'est le SaintGraal qui vous trouve. 
Langdon held the wooden box up to the light and examined the inlaid symbol of the Rose. 
Secret. 
Opening the box, he examined the inside of the lid. 
It took almost no effort. 
Sophie Neveu, despite working in law enforcement, had never found herself at gunpoint until tonight. 
Teabing slipped his right hand through one of his crutches and grasped the keystone in his left. 
Silas stepped quickly forward to take the stone, and as he did, the man on crutches lost his balance. 
But the keystone was moving away from him now. 
Before he could raise the gun and fire again, the woman's foot caught him square beneath the jaw. 
Langdon drifted out again. 
"Christianity is my field of study, Robert, and there are certain sects who wear their hearts on their sleeves." 
Even before they entered, Collet could hear the fading sounds of a car engine. 
 Collet wheeled, anger brimming. 
The agent pointed down the length of the stalls. 
All he could make out was the faint shadow of a forest in the distance. 
This wooded valley was probably crisscrossed by dozens of unmapped fire roads and hunting trails, but Collet was confident his quarry would never make the woods. 
These fancy sports cars can't handle terrain." Um, sir?" 
Rémy coasted to a crawl and guided the Range Rover through an opening in the hedge. 
Well, Rémy," Teabing chimed happily. 
Langdon knew Teabing was right. 
Are you sure we should have brought him?" Langdon asked. Bloody well positive!" 
My plane. 
Furthermore, the Grail is believed to be in Great Britain. 
Gazing absently out the window, Langdon watched the woods passing by, ghostly pale in the yellow blush of the fog lights. 
Unable to inhale through the strip of tape over his mouth, he could only breathe through his nostrils, which were slowly clogging up due to the dusty rear cargo area into which he had been crammed. 
I think he's choking," the French driver said, sounding concerned. 
Sophie looked wary. 
The manuscript I gave you. 
Have you—" Robert, I'm sorry, I know I said I'd send the edits out to you this week, but I'm swamped. 
Next Monday. 
What do you think? 
"Hold on, aren't you supposed to be in Paris this week?" 
I've got to run, but this explains a lot Thanks." 
Asking Jacques Saunière to endorse a manuscript on goddess worship was as obvious as asking Tiger Woods to endorse a book on golf. 
He had. 
"I talked about the supposed keystone as an example of the lengths to which the Priory would go to protect the Sangreal documents." 
Think about it, Robert. 
"Almost ready, sir," he called in a British accent. 
Until this moment, she had believed her game of cat and mouse with Fache would be somehow justifiable to the Ministry of Defense. 
At almost the speed of sound. 
He sounded apprehensive, like a father about to give the birdsandthebees lecture to his children. 
And yet, as someone who has spent his life in search of the Grail, I feel it is my duty to warn you that you are about to step onto a path from which there is no return, regardless of the dangers involved." 
This torch cannot fall into the wrong hands." 
If not the possessor of the keystone, then who?" 
The brotherhood was shattered tonight. 
A time when the world is ready to handle the truth." 
For our keeping his bank's name out of the news and also for helping him recover some stolen property. 
What?" Collet blurted. 
Vernet didn't elaborate, but he sounds like he's willing to do anything to get it back." 
Maybe they forced Vernet to open Saunière's account and facilitate an escape in the armored truck. 
As feasible as it was, Collet was having trouble believing Sophie Neveu could be involved in anything like that. 
Try to do something right for a change." 
Eager for his chance to see the text, he quivered with excitement, leaning in, trying to see around Langdon, who was still hunched over the box. I don't know," Langdon whispered intently. 
Most primary Semitics include nekkudot. 
Langdon was still hovering over the script. "A Sephardic transliteration, perhaps...?" 
Teabing and Langdon turned in unison, staring at her. 
Historians still debated whether Da Vinci wrote this way simply to amuse himself or to keep people from peering over his shoulder and stealing his ideas, but the point was moot. 
The roots of iambic pentameter were deeply pagan. 
This poem," Teabing gushed, "references not only the Grail, but the Knights Templar and the scattered family of Mary Magdalene! 
Sophie thought. 
Let me ponder this while I get us some nibblies and check on Rémy and our guest." 
Ingeniously hidden... but present nonetheless. 
I swear, sir, there is no way for me to know that. 
"If they're going to Biggin Hill, how long until they land?" 
Teabing was still in the back of the plane, and Langdon decided to take advantage of the moment alone with Sophie to tell her something that had been on his mind. 
Were both men and women present?" 
Marriage as in union, Sophie." 
Intercourse was the revered union of the two halves of the human spirit—male and female—through which the male could find spiritual wholeness and communion with God. 
It's a deeply sacrosanct ceremony." 
Sophie was silent, but Langdon sensed she was starting to understand her grandfather better. 
"Our ancient heritage and our very physiologies tell us sex is natural—a cherished route to spiritual fulfillment—and yet modern religion decries it as shameful, teaching us to fear our sexual desire as the hand of the devil." 
From what he'd heard about Harvard parties, these kids were having more than enough sex. 
In the shadows of her hiding place on the staircase, she watched as the strangers swayed and chanted by flickering orange candles. 
The women's beautiful gossamer gowns billowed as they raised in their right hands golden orbs and called out in unison, "I was with you in the beginning, in the dawn of all that is holy, I bore you from the womb before the start of day." 
What are they looking at? 
What is going on? 
What have I gotten Silas into? 
Aringarosa walked back to his black briefcase, opened it, and removed one of the bearer bonds. 
"I could not possibly part with this." 
Aringarosa slunk out of the cockpit and sat back down. 
"Our friend the monk isn't talking yet," he chimed, "but give him time." 
He bit into a cracker and eyed the poem. 
The cola was warm. 
Sophie leaned in to hear. 
Correct. 
They fabricated all kinds of charges. 
Langdon quickly explained to Sophie that Baphomet was a pagan fertility god associated with the creative force of reproduction. 
We only have room for five." 
Teabing grinned broadly. 
A B G D H V Z Ch T Y K Th Sh R Q Tz P O S N M L Teabing eyed her handiwork and chuckled. 
The decryption process was simple. Sheshach, in Hebrew, was spelled: ShShK. 
B is Sh... 
What's wrong?" Sophie demanded. 
She heard the sound of her voice, and could not believe what she had just said. 
Carefully," Teabing urged. 
This is the Priory keystone. 
"Pull out the scroll." 
Sophie unrolled the scroll and revealed what was wrapped inside. 
Made of black onyx. 
It looked identical to the first, except half the size and black. 
Written in ornate penmanship was another fourline verse. 
The verse was cryptic, but Langdon needed to read only as far as the first line to realize that Teabing's plan to come to Britain was going to pay off. 
Multiple sets matching those in the rest of the house." 
This Brit's a strange one," the examiner said. 
The photo showed the main entrance of a Gothic cathedral—the traditional, recessed archway, narrowing through multiple, ribbed layers to a small doorway. 
"May I help you?" 
There was a long pause on the line. 
The revelation made him gasp. 
Seat belts, please," Teabing's pilot announced as the Hawker 731 descended into a gloomy morning drizzle. "We'll be landing in five minutes." 
A British customs official will greet us at my hangar and ask to board the plane. 
Rather than permitting him to come on, I'll tell him I'm traveling with a French celebrity who prefers that nobody knows she is in England—press considerations, you know—and I'll offer the official this generous tip as gratitude for his discretion." 
Sophie looked wary. 
He scowled toward the monk in the rear of the plane. 
Sir?" the pilot called back. 
Teabing had been flying to Biggin Hill for over a decade, and this was a first. 
"Did they mention what the problem is?" 
The pumping station was a good half mile from his hangar. 
Leave you all out of it." 
Miss Neveu assisted in your escape from the Louvre, and we have a man tied up in the back of the plane. 
"Give me a minute," he said, hobbling toward the cockpit. 
What are you doing?" Langdon asked. 
The instant this happened, a runway attendant would place safety wedges under the tires so the plane could no longer move. 
He nodded toward the Jaguar stretch limousine in the far corner of the hangar. 
Representatives from the French police will be landing shortly." 
"No you won't, Inspector. 
We received a bad tip." 
Teabing's eyes were menacing even across the hangar. 
Sophie and Langdon both shook their heads. 
It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb. 
There was a knight buried in London. 
Moreover, once they located the tomb, it sounded as if they would be searching for something that was absent. 
"Very well, I will walk you through it. 
'In London lies a knight a Pope interred.' 
A knight whose funeral was presided over by a Pope?" 
"Oh, that's rich. 
Always the optimist, Robert. 
This knight obviously did something that incurred the Holy wrath of the Church. 
"Many of them were burned at the stake and tossed unceremoniously into the Tiber River. 
A tomb in London. 
The Templars ignored the traditional Christian cruciform layout and built a perfectly circular church in honor of the sun." 
Sophie eyed Teabing. 
If the missing orb revealed the password, they would be able to open the second cryptex. 
I'm not sure where that is. 
He left them, clambering awkwardly toward the open divider to talk to Rémy. 
We are invisible. 
Sophie was silent for several seconds. 
Your grandfather didn't even know me." Even so, I can't help but think you've done everything he would have wanted. 
You helped me find the keystone, explained the Sangreal, told me about the ritual in the basement." 
Those who truly understand their faiths understand the stories are metaphorical." 
"Religious allegory has become a part of the fabric of reality. 
Langdon's Mickey Mouse wristwatch read almost seventhirty when he emerged from the Jaguar limousine onto Inner Temple Lane with Sophie and Teabing. 
The architecture was coarse and simple, more reminiscent of Rome's rugged Castel Sant'Angelo than the refined Pantheon. 
It's early on a Saturday," Teabing said, hobbling toward the entrance, "so I'm assuming we won't have services to deal with." 
To the left of the door, looking entirely out of place, hung a bulletin board covered with concert schedules and religious service announcements. 
Inside the church, an altar boy was almost finished vacuuming the communion kneelers when he heard a knocking on the sanctuary door. 
Sir Christopher Wren was the Temple Church's most famous benefactor. 
The visitor's eyes sharpened now, and he leaned forward whispering as if to save everyone some embarrassment. 
I'm certain nobody has ever performed the first scene of Act Three with more dedication." 
I was brilliant, I tell you." 
"Bleak," he whispered. 
Teabing chuckled. 
He and his successors actually held the Parliamentary chair of Primus Baro Angiae." 
His eye traced the curvature of the chamber's pale stone perimeter, taking in the carvings of gargoyles, demons, monsters, and pained human faces, all staring inward. 
Ten stone knights. 
In a rubbishstrewn alley very close to Temple Church, Rémy Legaludec pulled the Jaguar limousine to a stop behind a row of industrial waste bins. 
I have been praying all night for liberation. 
Silas felt the biting warmth spreading across his back and shoulders and could picture his own blood, spilling out over his flesh. 
A blurry image was leaning over him, offering a glass of liquid. 
With the police arriving at Château Villette, and then at Biggin Hill airport, this was the first possible moment. 
But the Teacher speaks highly of you. 
There is much I have to tell you," Rémy said, handing Silas the loaded Heckler Koch pistol. 
"But first, you and I have a job to do." 
Fache walked up to the plane and rapped loudly on the fuselage. 
Open the safe," Fache demanded. The pilot looked terrified. 
"I know some men in maintenance here. 
Fache strode to the back of the plane and poured himself a hard drink. 
I will find Silas and the others as soon as possible. 
Tell him to come to Biggin Hill Executive Airport in Kent. 
The oddity seemed to have no relevance to the missing orb. 
Sophie turned her attention to the only other obvious difference—their hand positions. 
It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb. 
"There's something missing over here." 
Arriving beside her both men gazed down in confusion at the tenth tomb. 
Why isn't this knight shown?" Langdon asked. Fascinating," Teabing said, stroking his chin. 
This coffin," Sophie said, "looks like it was carved at the same time and by the same sculptor as the other nine tombs. 
"You look familiar." 
Langdon spoke his lines with Teabingesque believability. 
The altar boy's expression turned even more skeptical. 
Of course they are tombs," Teabing declared. 
"What are you talking about?" 
Stone tributes to real men. 
I can't imagine he knows what he is talking about. 
Not an effigy." 
Could the poem be wrong?" Teabing asked. 
He wheeled back toward the knights. 
Entering the annex, the altar boy was surprised to find it deserted. "Father Knowles?" 
You've proven you're willing to kill for it." 
Soon he would be free—another unrecognizable, beautiful face soaking up the sun on the beach. 
So have no fear. 
"Old man, I've been waiting a long time to do this." 
Why do you want the Grail?" Langdon demanded. 
We've known each other for ten—" Rémy aimed at the ceiling and fired the Medusa. 
"I don't think so. 
Vernet's credit card records showed a penchant for art books, expensive wine, and classical CD's—mostly Brahms—which he apparently enjoyed on an exceptionally highend stereo system he had purchased several years ago. 
Skipped out on a hospital bill once for an emergency tracheotomy." 
A senior PTS agent appeared at the top of the ladder, looking down. 
As he neared the top, Collet almost lost his footing on a thin rung. 
"Only one set of prints up here. 
We'll have an ID shortly." 
"Someone clearly knows what he's doing. A lot of this gear is as sophisticated as our own equipment. 
As long as the microphone was positioned such that it received a few hours of sunlight per day, the photo cells would keep recharging the system. 
Collet's gaze moved now to a shelf on which were stacked several hundred audio cassettes, all labeled with dates and numbers. 
Whoever was pursuing the Grail had recruited someone on the inside. 
Instant answers to any religious historical question. 
He wondered what the database would have to say about "a knight a Pope interred." 
Snow Hill Division," the dispatcher said. 
Sophie knew to be concise. Name please?" 
How much easier to identify could a suspect be? 
Finally a man came on the line. 
He knows I'm in London? 
What else does Fache know? 
As promised, the name of your bank has not appeared in the media. 
They murdered people tonight. 
Have you sent anyone in to sweep for the bug?" 
His hands felt damp on the keystone as he waited for Rémy to finish tying and gagging Teabing in back with the rope they had found in the trunk. 
Rémy glanced at Silas. 
Yes, sir." The Teacher heaved a sigh, as if what he now had to do was profoundly regrettable. 
Rémy still marveled at the Teacher's powers of persuasion. 
"I didn't know you were coming." 
"I'm afraid we've come unannounced. A friend of mine speaks very highly of you. 
Can you be a little more specific?" 
A knight. 
Gettum paused, feeling she was not getting the whole story. 
Because the massive collection was now in the form of bits and bytes rather than physical pages, the data was infinitely more accessible. Settling into one of the workstations, Gettum eyed the slip of paper and began typing. 
Gettum typed in a few words: LONDON, KNIGHT, POPE As she clicked the SEARCH button, she could feel the hum of the massive mainframe downstairs scanning data at a rate of 500 MB/sec. 
We'll get more hits than we want, but it's a good place to start." 
The Collected Portraits of Sir Joshua Reynolds. London University Press. 
"Obviously not what you're looking for." 
Again she shook her head. 
Langdon glanced at Sophie Neveu, looking uncertain. 
She had heard the whisperings of Robert Langdon's experience in Rome last year. 
Search for: KNIGHT, LONDON, POPE, TOMB Within 100 word proximity of: GRAIL, ROSE, SANGREAL, CHALICE How long will this take?" Sophie asked. 
The rain was cleansing. 
He wondered, though, about Teabing, whom Rémy had left bound in the back of the limousine. The Briton certainly had to be feeling the pain by now. 
Now, as Silas approached the Opus Dei building, the rain began to fall harder, soaking his heavy robe, stinging the wounds of the day before. 
The end is near." 
"I've probably had enough," he managed, weakly. Taking the flask, the Teacher said, "Rémy, as you are aware, you are the only one who knows my face. 
"And your identity shall go with me to the grave." The Teacher was silent a long moment. 
"But considering your circumstances, this is the best I can do." 
Rémy's eyesight blurred, and he gasped for breath. 
I trusted you with everything! 
Even so, that the others had not figured it out was not surprising. 
The Teacher vaguely recalled photos of the famous tomb and, in particular, its most distinguishing feature. 
He thought it would be safest." 
Langdon's eyes had not left the computer screen since the search began. 
Langdon eyed the screen. 
No," Langdon said, feeling a sudden intrigue. 
"But he was a wellknown Freemason." 
Along with Mozart, Beethoven, Shakespeare, Gershwin, Houdini, and Disney. 
Please don't tell me it's your Sir Rudy Giuliani. 
Sir Isaac Newton's burial, attended by kings and nobles, was presided over by Alexander Pope, friend and colleague, who gave a stirring eulogy before sprinkling dirt on the tomb. 
Sophie stood up, looking stunned. Jacques Saunière, the master of doubleentendres, had proven once again that he was a frighteningly clever man. 
And yet he felt a sudden and unexpected wariness. 
Standing, wearing only his undergarments, Silas walked to the window. 
Was I followed? 
Long ago Silas had learned to trust his intuition. 
On the car's roof was a police siren. 
When he reached the foyer, more officers were surging through the front door. 
Silas could hear men running down the hall shouting. 
More than three thousand people are entombed or enshrined within Westminster Abbey. 
Stepping across the threshold into Westminster Abbey, Langdon felt the outside world evaporate with a sudden hush. 
On sunny days, the abbey floor was a prismatic patchwork of light. 
"If anyone is in here, they can't be armed." 
We need to recover the cryptex, Sophie had insisted. 
Keeping architectural tradition, the abbey was laid out in the shape of a giant crucifix. 
"Let's find a docent." 
Newton's tomb consisted of a massive blackmarble sarcophagus on which reclined the sculpted form of Sir Isaac Newton, wearing classical costume, and leaning proudly against a stack of his own books—Divinity, Chronology, Opticks, and Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. 
Was there a missing planet? 
"You should stay hidden just in case someone—" Sophie had already stepped from the shadows and was headed across the open floor. is watching," Langdon sighed, hurrying to join her. 
The End of Days, Langdon thought. 
This eloquence was definitely lacking in the concept of planetary orbs and the zodiac. 
Langdon had forgotten just how large this room was. 
He was portly and was propped on a pair of aluminum crutches. 
We thought you were in trouble. 
Teabing's voice was relentless. 
It is obvious they pressured him to keep the truth quiet." 
"How could you know that?" 
The important thing for you to grasp right now is this." 
She opened her mouth to speak but was unable. 
Langdon shook his head. 
"You want proof the Priory was influenced? 
She wondered if there had been Priory members in the shadows throughout her entire life, looking after her. 
Shall the Church be permitted to influence indefinitely with murder and extortion? 
And now we are poised to carry out Saunière's legacy and right a terrible wrong." 
He never had a chance to explain the truth because you rejected him, tying his hands, making him wait. 
There had to be some other explanation. 
"A token of trust, Robert." 
Leigh is giving the keystone back to us? 
When I saw you enter the abbey, I understood. 
You were here for a reason. 
The dials were still in random order, and the cryptex remained locked. 
You are an historian, Robert. 
No, you will vindicate them. 
Destiny has led us to this moment." 
You would not tell me?" 
This is noble?" Langdon demanded, eyeing the gun. 
But with the police on your heels, I had a sneaking suspicion you might arrive on my doorstep." 
If only Rémy had not revealed himself, Teabing thought ruefully, recalling his own mock kidnapping. 
With the soundproof divider raised, Teabing was able to phone Silas in the front seat, use the fake French accent of the Teacher, and direct Silas to go straight to Opus Dei. 
He opened his eyes, trying to see, but the rain on his face blurred his vision. 
The great albino was struggling down a misty sidewalk, shouting for a hospital, his voice a heartrending wail of agony. 
No, Silas," Aringarosa replied. 
Too fearful. 
Speak openly." 
Aringarosa glanced at the two cardinals, who seemed to be measuring him with selfrighteous anticipation. 
Aringarosa was certain he had heard incorrectly. "I beg your pardon?" Plainly stated, six months from today, Opus Dei will no longer be considered a prelature of the Vatican. 
His Holiness agrees and we are already drawing up the legal papers." 
When Opus Dei is the only remaining voice of reason!" 
People have lost respect. 
The rules are not workable in today's society." Well, they seem to be working for Opus Dei!" 
"Out of respect for your organization's relationship with the previous Pope, His Holiness will be giving Opus Dei six months to voluntarily break away from the Vatican. 
"The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away." 
He had hoped only a handful of Vatican power brokers knew of Opus Dei's impending annulment. 
The doctor who helped Silas heave the delirious bishop onto a gurney looked gloomy as he felt Aringarosa's pulse. 
"My child..." 
"Father, if it takes my lifetime, I will find the one who deceived us, and I will kill him." 
Turning his back to the others, he walked toward the towering windows, searching for any inspiration in their stainedglass mosaics. 
Like a taunting silhouette emerging from the fog, the branches of Britain's oldest apple tree burgeoned with fivepetaled blossoms, all glistening like Venus. 
It was no coincidence that Teabing launched his plan into action on the same night Langdon was scheduled to meet Jacques Saunière. 
Arranging the fatal meeting between Saunière and Silas had been almost too easy. 
Saunière's response was startled but wary. 
Yes, a car accident," Silas said, baiting the hook. 
Although the idea troubled him, he knew he would not hesitate if it came to that. 
"The tomb..." he said suddenly, facing them with a faint glimmer of hope in his eyes. 
"I know where to look on Newton's tomb. 
I'm not going anywhere," Sophie declared, her eyes narrowing with rage. 
I'm trying to help you!" 
He trusted you, Robert. 
"Shoot me if you have to. 
I know you better than that." Do you, Leigh?" 
It took me several seconds, but I can see now that you are lying. 
Robert, this man is not worthy of the Grail. 
He knew not from where the epiphany came. 
Yes, Robert," Teabing whispered, aiming the gun at him. 
He knows! 
His life's dream was right in front of him. 
It's not too late!" 
You should have come in when I asked." 
His dirty work had been carried out unknowingly by a fanatical monk and a desperate bishop. 
The information coming from Collet out of Château Villette suggested that Teabing's cunning ran so deep that Fache himself might even learn from it. 
To successfully hide bugs in some of Paris's most powerful offices, the British historian had turned to the Greeks. 
Bring him to dinner, Teabing had suggested. 
The sunlight felt welcome and warm on his face. 
Last night, however, Aringarosa had received a call from Bezu Fache, questioning the bishop about his apparent connection to a nun who had been murdered in SaintSulpice. 
The Teacher laid bare for all to see. 
Aringarosa had been far too eager to be suspicious. 
"I believe this belongs to you." 
Aringarosa felt tears welling as he accepted the ring and slipped it back on his finger. 
A little faith." CHAPTER 104 Rosslyn Chapel—often called the Cathedral of Codes—stands seven miles south of Edinburgh, Scotland, on the site of an ancient Mithraic temple. 
Rosslyn's rugged spires were casting long evening shadows as Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu pulled their rental car into the grassy parking area at the foot of the bluff on which the chapel stood. 
To him, Rosslyn Chapel seemed far too obvious a location. 
Archaeologists petitioned to begin blasting through the bedrock to reach the mysterious chamber, but the Rosslyn Trust expressly forbade any excavation of the sacred site. 
She was holding the rosewood box, which Captain Fache had returned to them. 
Langdon had to admit, there existed an intriguing symmetry in the idea of the Templars building a modern Grail repository that echoed the Grail's original hiding place. 
ROSLIN This ancient spelling, Langdon explained to Sophie, derived from the Rose Line meridian on which the chapel sat; or, as Grail academics preferred to believe, from the "Line of Rose"—the ancestral lineage of Mary Magdalene. 
The docent had seen Langdon and Sophie enter, and although it was closing time, offered a pleasant smile and motioned for them to feel free to look around. 
Sophie, however, stood riveted in the entryway, a puzzled look on her face. 
Do you remember earlier that I mentioned Rosslyn itself is a copy of Solomon's Temple? 
The code," Sophie blurted, in sudden revelation. 
The docent's voice trailed off. 
She was a little girl... a year or so after her family's death. 
It was late evening, and the chapel was closed. 
How about if you wait in the car?" 
He nodded. 
"And my grandmother." 
"I've lived here my whole life. 
He was only halfway there when he stopped short. 
My grandmother raised me. 
My grandfather made it for her. 
He made all kinds of things." 
"You said your grandmother raised you. 
Feeling herself drawn closer, Sophie stepped onto the porch stairs. 
The woman was clutching a framed photograph of a man and touching her fingertips to his face with loving sadness. 
The woman threw her arms around Sophie, the tears flowing faster. 
He turned. 
"I thought I'd give your family some time together." 
Marie came over and stood beside him. 
My husband obviously trusted you, Mr. Langdon, so I do as well. 
Hearing of the accident, Jacques and I had no way to know what had really happened... or if this was truly an accident." 
Then your brother and I went underground with the Priory. Jacques, being a man of prominence, did not have the luxury of disappearing. 
It only made sense that Sophie, being the eldest, would stay in Paris to be taught and raised by Jacques, close to the heart and protection of the Priory." 
Langdon fell silent, feeling the weight of her message upon him. 
This is not the moment. 
I didn't see any symbols of the blade and chalice up there." 
Langdon sensed she was toying with him, but he played along, quickly describing the symbols. 
Before Langdon could answer, Marie Chauvel had stepped off the porch and was heading toward the chapel. 
The blade and chalice." 
Jacques's charge when he became Grand Master was to restore her honor by returning her to France and building her a resting place fit for a queen." 
"We are standing over an underground vault marked by the blade and chalice, underneath a ceiling of stars, surrounded by the art of Master Masons. 
The blade and chalice guarding o'er Her gates. Adorned in masters' loving art, She lies. She rests at last beneath the starry skies. When she finished, she was still for several seconds, until a knowing smile crossed her lips. 
"Mr. Langdon, I will make a confession to you. 
She smiled. 
She kissed Sophie's forehead. 
"Not exactly the ending I expected." That makes two of us, he thought. 
It's a lot to take in." 
She smiled quietly. 
That's where I'm going to start. 
Langdon remained silent. 
Langdon felt an unexpected sadness to realize he would be returning to Paris without her. 
He cringed at how it had sounded. 
Langdon's body felt warm and deeply contented. 
He had slept the better part of the last two days. 
Walking east on Rue des Petits Champs, Langdon felt a growing excitement. 
With a final surge of energy, Langdon burst from the passageway into the familiar courtyard and came to a stop. 
This hallowed ground was now marked by one of the city's most unusual monuments. 
The day's last visitors were trickling out of the museum. 
He could feel the air grow cooler. 
The only structure in this colossal complex that had been built on a small scale. 
Illuminated in the soft lights of the deserted entresol, the two pyramids pointed at one another, their bodies perfectly aligned, their tips almost touching. 
Under all circumstances and unconditionally, they derive great pleasure from being in the company of other Muslims. 
The true source of love in the believers’ hearts is their profound love of Allah. 
That is the good news that Allah gives to His servants who believe and do right actions. 
Allah is the Source of Each Person’s Beauty 
For example, people can breathe with ease, for, out of His mercy, He created the correct proportion of atmospheric gases needed for people to breathe. 
In fact, the peacock’s designs and colors of its tail, one of the world’s most beautiful spectacles, is enough to remind people to thank Allah and is just one of the blessings that shows His power and ability to create. 
Allah presents all of these beautiful creatures as a blessing to humanity. 
The top of each petal resembles a very expensive material that is almost as soft as velvet. 
Despite being planted and raised in muddy black soil, its lively colors are never dirtied or distorted. 
Allah informs us that all of His creations contain many proofs on which people should reflect: 
And He created livestock. There is warmth and various uses for you in them, and some you eat. 
For this reason, we must continually thank Him for these blessings and feel a great love for Him. 
Whatever a baby needs was created billions of years ago. 
Therefore, if a person were to look at his body, a great deal of evidence could be found to lead him to acquire a profound and great love of Allah. 
Those who reflect on these details see that they are constantly dependent upon Allah, Who has created them and enabled them to live. Without His consent, they could not even breathe. Thus, they can understand that Allah is their closest friend and guardian. 
Our Lord, the possessor of infinite mercy and compassion, has called people to the easiest and most beautiful path through His books and messengers. 
Allah does not impose on any self any more than it can bear. 
Our Lord, do not place on us a load like the one You placed on those before us. 
They sought only Allah’s good pleasure, even at the risk of death, and spent their lives calling people to the true path. 
One of the best examples of Allah’s help and support can be seen in the life of Prophet Musa (as), who fled from his city, turned to Allah, and made the following supplication: “My Lord, I am truly in need of any good You have in store for me” (Surat alQasas, 24). 
Following the revelation of Prophet Musa’s (as) prophethood, Allah appointed his brother, Prophet Harun (as), to support and help him in his mission to Pharaoh. 
In reality, Allah brings all issues to an end and provides for a person’s blessings in the best possible way. 
For people who seek Allah’s help and who view our Lord as their true guardian, only true friend, and helper, Allah guarantees that His help will reach them from many different paths. 
Allah reminds us that He is each person’s true guardian and source of help in the following verse: 
At every point of our life, we depend upon Allah to offer us His mercy, bestow some of His kindness and blessings, and protect and ensure our safety. 
While making a supplication, we can ask for anything that we want, provided that we adhere to Allah’s will and observe the limits that He has set for humanity. 
Throughout our lives, each of us has perhaps experienced and witnessed many people acting unjustly. 
All people have received their portion of justice, and will continue to do so in the future. 
On the Day We summon every people with their records, those who are given their book in their right hand will read their book and will not be wronged by even the smallest speck. 
Subsequently, in all situations he knows that Allah’s justice is manifest in that incident and thus welcomes with absolute love and happiness any incident that our Lord creates. 
Anas (ra) narrates that: “Allah’s Messenger (saas) said: ‘Whoever has the following three qualities will have the sweetness of faith: The one who loves Allah and His Messenger (saas) more than anything else; the one who loves a person purely and solely for Allah’s sake; and the one who hates to return to unbelief after Allah has saved him, as he would hate to be thrown into the Fire.”(Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim) 
Allah reveals the believers’ love for the prophets and informs us that they always put the prophets ahead of themselves: 
And left the later people saying of them: “Peace be upon Musa and Harun.” 
And praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds. 
Those who are loved by Allah are also loved by believers; those who befriend Allah also befriend the believers; those who earn His good pleasure also earn that of the believers; and whoever loves Allah should also love His servants. 
Allah loves those who fight in His way in ranks like wellbuilt walls. 
You were on the very brink of a pit of the Fire, and He rescued you from it. 
The Prophet (saas)said: “Give present to one another, and you will then have love for one another.” 
They use whatever they possess in their struggle to realize this goal. 
The believers, on the other hand, know that no person or any part of creation has any innate strength or beauty, for it is Allah Who created all of them from nothing. 
Allah does not guide people who are deviators.” 
We see this in the case of Prophet Yahya (as), of whom the Qur’an says: 
The ebullient love felt toward Allah will bring forth a natural affection and love in their souls for anything His eternal beauty, masterpiece, wisdom and power are manifest. 
Only such people experience “true” love in the spiritual sense. 
The basis for this love is having faith and respect for Allah and internalizing the Qur’an’s morals, both of which will cause them to love others for the sake of Allah with a strong and deep love. 
Some people channel their love and devotion toward other people who are, in essence, weak, instead of channeling it toward Allah. 
Or, they think about this person all night and thus cannot sleep. 
In other words, they transform the objects of their attention into little deities. 
An evildoer will wish he could ransom himself from the punishment of that Day by means of his sons, his wife, his brother, or his family who sheltered him, or everyone else on Earth, if that only meant that he could save himself. 
The Day a man will flee from his brother, his mother, his father, and his wife and children. On that Day, every man among them will have concerns enough of his own. 
Many people fear living alone, being unable to support themselves, or of having no one to look after them when they are sick. 
Similarly, those whom you formerly claimed to love become people that you have to tolerate if they have experienced some misfortune or some physical problem. For example, you might no longer love a person if he or she somehow becomes disfigured by an accident or an illness. 
As a result, their love for each other only grows stronger. 
People who do not live according to the Qur’an’s morals cannot love or be loved in the true sense of the word. 
However, if selfsacrificing is required and there is no real gain in sight for that person, most people will seek to avoid such obligations. 
The Qur’an informs us of the beautiful morals of the believers in the following verse: 
The people who are safeguarded from the avarice of their own selves are successful. 
This demonstrates their superior morals and indicates the fact they have chosen Allah as their guardian and are trustworthy people. 
Their selfsacrificing actions were based on their strong and sincere love for Allah and all other believers. 
One of them decides to eat the food and use the bed without asking you for permission, while the other person, despite being hungry, offers his food to you and insists that you sleep in the bed. In this situation, you would feel quite cold toward the selfish person, but quite warm and loving toward the one who placed his needs below yours. 
Believers, who are very patient and forgiving, will not become angry and end their friendships just because of some minor mistakes and misgivings. 
Allah reveals that believers should be forgiving: 
Allah reveals in the Qur’an that one has to be able to forgive in order to develop true love: 
Thus, love and haughtiness are mutually exclusive. 
On the other hand, modest people are always loved, for they value the person in front of them and, because of their adherence to Qur’anic values, other people will feel at ease with them. 
For this reason, modest people are usually loved very much. 
Some unbelievers feel very comfortable when telling lies. 
For believers, there are no such things as white lies. 
They consider that they have the right to sulk, complain, or act badly. 
Allah tells all believers to be patient with others, for it is one of their most beautiful character traits: 
The believers, who have never left each other, as a result of their love for Allah and their fear, respect, and closeness to Him, have endured all of these dangers and have not yielded to them. 
Merciful people do not wish for the people living around them to lead miserable lives no matter how important their own lives are, how well they are doing, for those people are just the same, even more important, than their own needs. 
A person’s real life, the eternal life of the Hereafter, only begins after death, for this world is no more than a temporary residence in which all people are tried. 
They invite one another to what is good and beautiful, and withdraw from what He has proclaimed to be unlawful. 
However, those who love other people sincerely forget their own desires and put those of their beloved’s first. 
He will gain great satisfaction if his beloved is in the right, instead of himself, and would rather do the work himself instead of seeing his beloved become tired. 
The geochemist Jeffrey Bada, from the San Diego Scripps Institute accepts this fact in an article published in Earth magazine in 1998: 
And so, at first glance, one might have to conclude that life could never, in fact, have originated by chemical means.6 
If such animals ever really existed, there should be millions and even billions of them in number and variety. 
If my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking most closely all of the species of the same group together must assuredly have existed... 
To Whom Does the Consciousness that Sees and Hears within the Brain Belong? 
Many people who see its true face are wondering with amazement how they could ever have been taken in by it. They said, "Glory be to You! 
Harun Yahya's books appeal to all kinds of readers, regardless of their age, race, or nationality, for they focus on one objective: to broaden the reader’s perspective by encouraging him or her to think about a number of critical issues, such as the existence of Allah and His unity, and to live by the values He prescribed for them. 
Very good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man and the just State, and the nature of justice in each of them, we should not be telling a falsehood? 
Then virtue is the health and beauty and wellbeing of the soul, and vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same? 
Well, and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect State? To be sure. And is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the possibility of a city being ordered in the manner described? Surely not, he replied. 
Yes. Then you would infer that opinion is intermediate? No question. 
Exactly. And what is the organ with which we see the visible things? The sight, he said. 
But do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason will have the knowledge which we require of them? 
When braggarts, selfsatisfied and in love with themselves, step early into the fame which belongs rightly to their future achievements, they are men of genius only in the eyes of fools. 
If talent is to be measured by youthful shyness, by that indefinable modesty which men born to glory lose in the practice of their art, as a pretty woman loses hers among the artifices of coquetry, then this unknown young man might claim to be possessed of genuine merit. 
Worn down with poverty and discouragement, and dismayed at this moment by his own presumption, the young neophyte might not have dared to enter the presence of the master to whom we owe our admirable portrait of Henry IV., if chance had not thrown an unexpected assistance in his way. 
Imagine a bald head, the brow full and prominent and falling with deep projection over a little flattened nose turned up at the end like the noses of Rabelais and Socrates; a laughing, wrinkled mouth; a short chin boldly chiselled and garnished with a gray beard cut into a point; seagreen eyes, faded perhaps by age, but whose pupils, contrasting with the pearlwhite balls on which they floated, cast at times magnetic glances of anger or enthusiasm. 
I feel no air between this arm and the background of the picture; space and depth are wanting. All is in good perspective; the atmospheric gradations are carefully observed, and yet in spite of your conscientious labor I cannot believe that this beautiful body has the warm breath of life. 
No, no, my friend, blood does not run beneath that ivory skin; the purple tide of life does not swell those veins, nor stir those fibres which interlace like network below the translucent amber of the brow and breast. 
"Ah! that is the question," said the little old man. 
Many a painter has triumphed through instinct without knowing this theory of art as a theory. 
I have just come to Paris, that fountain of art and science." 
Alas! the heights of knowledge, like the depths of ignorance, lead to unbelief. 
"See, he is talking to his own soul," said Porbus in a low voice. 
"Oh! the old dragon has guarded the entrance. 
Ah, Gillette, we shall be rich, happy! 
"A secret!" she cried; "then I must know it." 
To me thou art more precious than fortune and honors. 
"It came there, and yet I love thee," he said, with a sort of contrition. 
"No, no! it must be a secret between us." 
"Wait," exclaimed Porbus. "I have come in time to spare you the costs and fatigues of such a journey." 
Poesy and women give themselves bare, like truth, to lovers only. 
I would kill you,you, my friend,if you did not worship her on your knees; and think you I would submit my idol to the cold eyes and stupid criticisms of fools? 
"Whoever sees it will find a woman lying on a velvet bed, beneath curtains; perfumes are exhaling from a golden tripod by her side: he will be tempted to take the tassels of the cord that holds back the curtain; he will think he sees the bosom of Catherine Lescaut,a model called the Beautiful Nutgirl; he will see it rise and fall with the movement of her breathing. 
I am but a child. 
His attitude, and above all the gesture with which he laid his hand upon the weapon, comforted the poor girl, who half forgave him for thus sacrificing her to his art and to his hopes of a glorious future. 
At first the painter of the Egyptian Mary uttered a few exclamations: "Ah, she unclothes herself!""He tells her to stand in the light!""He compares them!" but he grew silent as he watched the mournful face of the young man; for though old painters have none of such petty scruples in presence of their art, yet they admire them in others, when they are fresh and pleasing. 
Never shall painter, brushes, colors, canvas, light, produce the rival of Catherine Lescaut, the Beautiful Nutgirl." 
Why, she breathes! 
"Nothing. Can you?" 
Some of these shadows have cost me endless toil. 
See, there on her cheek, below the eyes, a faint halfshadow; if you observed it in Nature you might think it could hardly be rendered. 
And with the end of his brush he pointed to a spot of clear light color. 
Frenhofer looked at his picture for a space of a moment, and staggered.

"Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've chosen! 
Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniturerattling noise? 
"Gregor, Gregor", he called, "what's wrong?" 
The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive. 
And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better to stay in bed than lose consciousness. 
At the same time, though, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. 
At times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him. 
And so he set himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all at the same time. 
"They're not opening the door", Gregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. 
But then of course, the maid's firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it. 
And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed. 
Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. 
That's just prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better it. 
One side of his body lifted itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it, soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. 
If she didn't do it herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it, although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the couch, throw himself at his sister's feet and beg her for something good to eat. However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise. 
When explaining things, his father repeated himself several times, partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these matters himself and partly because Gregor's mother did not understand everything first time. 
He could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father's debt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself from that job would have come much closer, but now it was certainly better the way his father had done things. 
This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one or two years, no more. 
It made him realise that she still found his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that protruded from under the couch. 
It was more than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence she had recently acquired, that made her insist; she had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the furniture, as far as anyone could see, was of no use to him at all. 
And so he ran up to his father, stopped when his father stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved, even slightly. In this way they went round the room several times without anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression of a chase as everything went so slowly. 
Sometimes he would think of taking over the family's affairs, just like before, the next time the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss and the chief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts, the salesmen and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow,all of them appeared to him, mixed together with strangers and others he had forgotten, but instead of helping him and his family they were all of them inaccessible, and he was glad when they disappeared. 
They asked Gregor's father for explanations, raised their arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room only very slowly. 
On the way they opened the door to the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this. "Dead?", asked Mrs. Samsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked for herself and could have known it even without checking. "That's what I said", replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor's body another shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor. 
She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregor's room. They did so, and stood around Gregor's corpse with their hands in the pockets of their wellworn coats.

The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S. Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations. 
And not just works of art: even a few bricks resting on top of one another make one think that they must have been brought to rest just so by someone within a certain plan. 
Therefore, everywhere where there is an order – either small or big – a founder and protector of this order must also exist. 
The claim of the theory of evolution, the unique method of denying the existence of Allah, is no different than this. 
The Almighty Creator is One Whom everything finds existence, yet Whose existence is without any beginning or end. 
The world overflows with many living beings, from unicellular organisms to plants, from insects to sea animals, and from birds to human beings. 
The questions of how the universe originated, where it leads to, and how the laws maintaining its order and balance work have always been topics of interest. 
Laying the groundwork for the materialist philosophy, this view denied the existence of a Creator while it maintained that the universe is a constant, stable, and unchanging collection of matter. 
Materialism is a system of thought that holds matter to be an absolute being and denies the existence of anything but matter. 
If it were, then it would have to be created instantaneously by God and brought into existence from nothing. 
It is a sign of Allah’s creation alone that everything formed perfectly all at once and in a single moment, when the created things had no previous examples and not even time and space existed in which to create them. 
However, he had laid his discovery to rest simply not to conflict with the widely recognised static universe model of his time. 
Subsequently, it became definite by Hubble’s observations that the universe expands. 
In truth, ‘a point with no volume’ means ‘nothingness’. 
Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of creation), before We clove them asunder? We made from water every living thing. 
If the universe had no beginning and if it had existed since eternity, its hydrogen constituent should have been completely consumed and converted to helium. 
The quote from Sir Fred Hoyle, who accepted his mistake after many years of opposition to the Big Bang Theory, expresses this situation very well: 
The laws of physics that emerged together with the Big Bang did not change at all over a period of 15 billion years. 
The atom, the buildingblock of matter, came into being after the Big Bang. 
These revolve both around themselves and each other unerringly at certain speeds. 
Ambiguous, useless, abnormal and purposeless things never occur. 
Everything from the smallest unit to the biggest component is organised and has manifold purposes. 
This Creator is Allah, the Lord of the heavens, the earth and all that is in between. 
Let there be in this city skyscrapers, twisting roads, railway stations, airports, shopping malls, subways and also rivers, lakes, forests and a beach. 
Take every detail into account. 
Certainly, there is a great power that creates such an order and harmony. 
Say: He it is Who brought you into being and made for you the ears and the eyes and the hearts: little is it that you give thanks. 
On the one side are viruses and bacteria that aim to intrude into your body and take it under control and on the other are the immunity cells that protect the body against these enemies. 
Later, the striker teams cut in (killer T cells). 
These discharge the poisonous material they carry on themselves at the most vital spot of the enemy. 
Therefore, it is impossible for a person without an immunity system to survive in a primitive environment. 
Thus the stomach is prevented from destroying itself. 
However, as stated clearly, the system in the stomach could in no way have been formed step by step. 
This living being, unable to acquire this ability, would not be able to digest the food it ate and would starve to death with an undigested mass of food in its stomach. 
Initially a mystery, the reasons underlying this insistent meeting came as a great surprise when finally revealed. 
In moments of danger, the insect squirts hydrogen peroxide and hydroquinone stored in its body towards the enemy to protect itself. 
The mixture is stored in a separate compartment called the storage chamber. 
The moment the insect senses danger, it squeezes the muscles surrounding the storage chamber while simultaneously relaxing the sphincter muscle, and the chemical in the storage chamber is transferred to the explosion chamber. A large quantity of heat is released and a vaporisation occurs. 
However, a termite nest proves to be of a marvellous design incomprehensible to the human mind: inside there are intersecting tunnels, corridors, ventilation systems, special fungus production yards and safety exits. 
What the woodpecker does is in a way similar to a human being driving a nail into the wall with his head. If a man ventured to do something like that, he would probably undergo a brain shock followed by a brain haemorrhage. 
Another interesting feature of woodpeckers is that their tongues are thin enough to penetrate even ants' nests in the trees. 
Has the butterfly happened to see the pattern on its wings and decided that this pattern was frightening and that it could use it in a moment of danger? 
Nevertheless, water lilies are still present today in all their perfection. The unbelievable life struggle of water lilies continues well after they reach light and oxygen on the water surface, where they curl the brims of their huge leaves upward to prevent them from sinking. 
The theory of evolution argued that the universe was not created by a creator but came into being by chance. As a result, it was asserted that religion was in conflict with science. 
But why? Is it because science says so? Actually it does not. On the contrary, science proves the truth of creation. 
This is because science supports religion, saves the individual from ignorance, and causes him to think more consciously; it opens wide one's world of thought and helps one grasp the signs of Allah selfevident in the universe. Prominent German physicist Max Planck said, "Anybody who has been seriously engaged in scientific work of any kind realizes that over the entrance to the gates of the temple of science are written the words: Ye must have faith. 
Many scientists who have left their mark on the world of science have confirmed, and still confirm this great reality. The more people learn about the universe, the higher does their admiration for its flawless order become. Every newlydiscovered detail supports creation in an unquestionable way. 
The great majority of modern physicists accept the fact of creation as we set foot in the 21st century. 
Besides, it is already known that almost all the founders of diverse scientific branches believed in Allah and His divine books. 
In the time of Isaac Newton, the great physicist, scientists believed that the movements of the heavenly bodies and planets could be explained by different laws. 
Michael Faraday (one of the greatest physicists of all times) 
At this point, let us refer to the relevant Qur'anic verses. In one verse, the following is stated about the creation of the universe: And it is We who have constructed the heaven with might, and verily, it is We who are steadily expanding it. 
Now, let us once again look at the verse which refers to a state in which the heavens and the earth are in a state of "ratk". Then, these two are meant to have been cloven asunder in the sense of the verb of "fatk". 
Indeed, clouds drift along before the moon, the blue vault of heaven turns around the pole star, the moon itself waxes and wanes over a longer period of time, and the moon and the planets move through a plane defined by the stars. 
Space may be imagined as an enormous cavity: an infinitely vast cavity, a cavity containing stars, planets and bodies in motion. However, space is not a cavity left to itself. 
The ultraviolet rays, which are only partially let in by the atmosphere are very important for the photosynthesis of plants and for the survival of all living beings. This radiation, which is very strongly emitted from the sun to the earth, is filtered through the ozone layer of the atmosphere and only a limited required portion of it reaches the earth. 
The Qur'an yielded information about the relativity of time! Three related verses are; Yet they ask you to hasten on the Punishment! But Allah will not fail in His Promise. 
These plates are enormously big and carry all the continents. When two plates collide, one usually slides under the other and the debris in between is raised up. 
The reason for this is the special form they take. 
Cones, hanging flowers, and some others make canals that open towards air currents. Spermproducing pollens arrive at reproductive regions thanks to these canals. 
The Mixture in the Semen The fluid called semen does not consist of sperms alone. On the contrary, it is made up of a mixture of different fluids. 
Verily We created Man from a drop of mingled sperm, in order to try him: So We gave him (the gifts), of hearing and sight. 
This shows that the Qur'an is the word of a Will that knows the creation of man down to its slightest detail. 
Because a female only has X chromosomes, her reproductive cells (ova) will contain only those. 
In the name of your Sustainer, who has created man from a clot. Read – for your Sustainer is the Most Bounteous. 
Was he not a drop of sperm emitted (in lowly form)? Then he became a clot; then Allah made and fashioned him in due proportion. 
The Qur'an has more to disclose about the zygote. Perfectly clinging to the uterus, the zygote starts to develop. 
Did We not create you from a base fluid which We placed in a safe place, firmly fixed? 
Though put forward as a supposedly scientific theory during the mid19th century, the theory, despite all the best efforts of its advocates, has not so far been verified by any scientific finding or experiment. 
Although little known before the end of the century, Mendel's discovery gained great importance in the early 1900s with the birth of the science of genetics. Some time later, the structures of genes and chromosomes were discovered. 
These developments ought to have resulted in Darwin's theory being banished to the dustbin of history. 
Why, if species have descended from other species by fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? 
In some ways, it has become almost unmanageably rich and discovery is outpacing integration… The fossil record nevertheless continues to be composed mainly of gaps.3 
The vast mosaic of living organisms, made up of such great numbers of complex creatures, emerged so suddenly that this miraculous event is referred to as the "Cambrian Explosion" in scientific literature. 
Some of them are robust, while others are small and slight. 
Evolutionists arranged various ape and human fossils in an order from the smallest to the biggest in order to form a "human evolution" scheme. 
Seeking to exaggerate these differences, evolutionists represent these people not as a "race" of modern man but as a different "species". 
To accept the latter is not appropriate to the goals of science. We therefore have to look into the first hypothesis.11 After these lines, Demirsoy admits that this probability, which he accepted just because it was "more appropriate to the goals of science", is unrealistic: 
In the Britannica Science Encyclopaedia, an ardent defender of evolution, the authors indicate that the amino acids of all living organisms on earth and the building blocks of complex polymers such as proteins have the same lefthanded asymmetry. 
While the improbability of the formation of a protein molecule made up of five hundred amino acids reaches such an extent, we can further proceed to push the limits of the mind to higher levels of improbability. 
Miller knew that methane, ammonia, water vapour and hydrogen would not react with each other under natural conditions. 
Miller boiled this gas mixture at 100 0C for a week, and, in addition, he introduced an electric current into the chamber. 
This experiment aroused great excitement among evolutionists and they promoted it as an outstanding success. 
Encouraged by the thought that this experiment definitely verified their theory, evolutionists immediately produced new scenarios. Miller had supposedly proved that amino acids could form by themselves. 
Some of these accidentally formed proteins placed themselves in cell membranelike structures, which "somehow" came into existence and formed a primitive cell. 
However, Miller's experiment was nothing but makebelieve, and has since been proven invalid in many respects. 
If he had used oxygen in the experiment, methane would have decomposed into carbon dioxide and water, and ammonia would have decomposed into nitrogen and water. 
This situation shows that there exist prejudices that cause these people to commit themselves to materialism, and its natural outcome, atheism. 
Of course there cannot be a single definition of such organised powers. 
Having its roots in the Western world, from which it subsequently spread elsewhere, this secret organisation, has always been the source of all antireligionist thought and activity in every country it has infiltrated. 
The history of Europe is remarkably clearcut on this point. 
The organisation of freemasonry and its offshoots have played an important role in the systematic propaganda being executed against religious beliefs over the last couple of centuries. 
Those balances demonstrate as a matter of unquestionable fact that the universe was CREATED. That being so, can it be said that this universe was created in vain? 
No advantage have you over us; so taste you of the penalty for all that you did! "(Surat alAraf, 3839) As is evident, it does not really make much difference whether one is a member of those who are foremost in disbelief or of those who lag behind. As a result, both groups suffer a great loss and deserve an everlasting penalty for the sins they have committed in the world. 
They say: "Ah! Woe unto us! Who has raised us up from our beds of repose?"... (A voice will say:) "This is what (Allah) Most Gracious had promised. 
The moment these people, with the stamp of ignominy on their faces, and heads fallen, emerge from their graves and assemble, the earth shines with light and the book of each one is brought by and by to be given to him. 
On this day of meeting, when enormous throngs of people hitherto unseen come together, the conditions of the believers and of the unbelievers are certainly different. 
In the Qur'an, this is related as follows: Then he that will be given his record in his right hand will say: "Ah here! read you my record! 
And they say: "The fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days:" Say: "Have you taken a promise from Allah, for He never breaks His promise? 
If they do not repent and be guided to Allah, Who created them, they will suffer the greatest penalties possible. 
The same situation applies to all our other senses. Sound, touch, taste and smell are all transmitted to the brain as electrical signals and are perceived in the relevant centres in the brain. 
The inner ear translates the vibrations into electrical signals, which it sends into the brain. 
Everything that we smell, be it pleasant or unpleasant, is nothing but the brain's perception of the interactions of volatile molecules after they have been transformed into electrical signals. 
Everything we see, touch, hear, and perceive as "matter", "the world" or "the universe" is only electrical signals occurring in our brain. 
If the sight nerves travelling to the brain were to be severed suddenly, the image of the fruit would suddenly disappear. 
Put simply, the fruit is nothing but the brain's interpretation of electrical signals. 
The smells that you perceive are like that too; none of them reaches you from a great distance. 
They are as they are just because we perceive them to be so. The "external world" depends entirely on the perceiver. Even the slightest defect in the retina of the eye causes colour blindness. 
First, let us transmit all the data related to a setting (including body image) to this instrument by transforming them into electrical signals. 
We often experience this feeling in our dreams, in which we experience events, see people, objects and settings that seem completely real. However, they are all nothing but mere perceptions. 
As we mentioned at the beginning, some people have no genuine understanding of Allah and so they imagine Him as a being present somewhere in the heavens and not really intervening in worldly affairs. 
Since material beings are each a perception, they cannot see Allah; but Allah sees the matter He created in all its forms. In the Qur'an, this is stated thus: "No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision." 
This fact is mentioned in the Qur'an: Fair in the eyes of people is the love of things they covet: Women and sons; heapedup hoards of gold and silver; horses branded (for blood and excellence); and (wealth of) cattle and welltilled land. 
On that day "sharp is one's sight" (Surah Qaf, 22) and we will see everything much more clearly. 
When we wake up from a dream, there is no logical reason not to think that we have entered a longer dream called "real life". 
According to Politzer, philosophers who think that matter is only a perception also run away when they see a bus about to run them over and this is the proof of the physical existence of matter.34 
They quote examples from the superficial reasoning of Marx, Engels, or Lenin and make emotional declarations. 
When asked in their dreams, they will think that what they experience in their dreams also consists of "absolute matter", just as they assume the things they see when they are awake are "absolute matter". 
As we see, it is not possible for man to transcend his senses and break free of them. 
The reactions of some materialists to the subject discussed here show that their blind adherence to materialism has caused some kind of harm to their logic. 
Conceding that all perceptions are formed in the brain, but assuming that one can step "out" of this and have the perceptions confirmed by the real external world, reveals that the intellectual capacity of the person is limited and that his reasoning is distorted. 
But those who defy Allah are themselves involved in a plot! 
Allah has deceived them with such a mirage, and beguiled them into perceiving this whole collection of images as real. 
Then see what was the end of their plot! 
(Surah Maryam, 95) This, on another level, is what the verses indicate: those who take matter as their god have come from Allah and returned to Him. They have submitted their wills to Allah whether they want or not. 
In the outside, it seems as if it is seen with the head's eye. 
Everything related so far demonstrates that "threedimensional space" does not exist in reality that it is a prejudice completely founded on perceptions and that one leads one's whole life in "spacelessness". 
If his memory did not exist, then he would not think of the existence of such a preceding period and he would only experience the single "moment" in which he lives. THE SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION OF TIMELESSNESS 
I can, indeed, associate numbers with the events, in such a way that a greater number is associated with the later event than with an earlier one.43 
A few days later, the answer we would give to the question about the amount of time we spent in the room would be based both on the information we had collected by looking at the clock from time to time and on the computation we had made by referring to how many times the sun rose and set. 
However, if the person who put us in that room said that we spent only two days in the room and that the sun we had seen from the window was produced artificially by a simulation machine and that the clock in the room was regulated specially to work faster, then the calculation we had done would have no meaning. This example confirms that the information we have about the rate of passage of time is based on relative references. The relativity of time is a scientific fact also proven by scientific methodology. 
Einstein's Theory of General Relativity maintains that the speed of time changes depending on the speed of the object and its position in the gravitational field. As speed increases, time is shortened and compressed: it slows down as if coming to the point of "stopping". 
Some verses indicate that people perceive time differently and that sometimes people can perceive a very short period as a very lengthy one. 
It is also important to draw attention to the shallowness of the distorted understanding of destiny prevalent in our society. This distorted belief of fate is a superstition that Allah has determined a "destiny" for every man but that these destinies can sometimes be changed by people. 
And Hell is placed in full view for (all) to see. (Surat anNazi'at, 36) 
To comprehend this secret is the greatest gain in the world. With this secret, another very important reality mentioned in the Qur'an is unveiled: that "Allah is nearer to man than his jugular vein" (Surah Qaf, 16). As everybody knows, the jugular vein is inside the body. 
What we have done throughout the book is to try to comprehend a subject that is an issue of the utmost importance for every person. 
When he saw the moon rising in splendour, he said: "This is my Lord." But when the moon set, he said: "Unless my Lord guides me, I shall surely be among those who go astray." 
You had no part in this process. You opened your eyes one day and found yourself amidst countless blessings. 
As I entered the Koishaur Valley the sun was disappearing behind the snowclad ridge of the mountains. In order to accomplish the ascent of Mount Koishaur by nightfall, my driver, an Ossete, urged on the horses indefatigably, singing zealously the while at the top of his voice. 
He was wearing a shaggy Circassian cap and an officer's overcoat without epaulettes, and he seemed to be about fifty years of age. The swarthiness of his complexion showed that his face had long been acquainted with Transcaucasian suns, and the premature greyness of his moustache was out of keeping with his firm gait and robust appearance. 
He smiled a second time. 
Why, the devil alone can make out what it is they do shout. 
But what can you make of them? 
The rogues have been spoiled! 
The staffcaptain answered not a word, but pointed with his finger to a lofty mountain which rose directly opposite us. 
"There's no crossing the mountains in such a blizzard. 
"Yes, I was quartered there for about ten years along with my company in a fortress, near Kamennyi Brod.[1] Do you know the place?" [1] Rocky Ford. 
Brave fellows, though!" ... 
"Really?" 
"Just so. 
You might easily spend a whole year without seeing a soul; but just go and have a drop and you're a lost man!" On hearing this I almost lost hope. 
"His name was Grigori Aleksandrovich Pechorin. 
Why, to give you an instance, one time he would stay out hunting the whole day, in the rain and cold; the others would all be frozen through and tired out, but he wouldn't mind either cold or fatigue. Then, another time, he would be sitting in his own room, and, if there was a breath of wind, he would declare that he had caught cold; if the shutters rattled against the window he would start and turn pale: yet I myself have seen him attack a boar singlehanded. Often enough you couldn't drag a word out of him for hours together; but then, on the other hand, sometimes, when he started telling stories, you would split your sides with laughing. 
"Yes, about a year. 
He had one bad quality; he was terribly greedy for money. 
At times we used to take it into our heads to tease him, and then his eyes would become bloodshot and his hand would fly to his dagger immediately. 
"On one occasion, the old prince himself came to invite us to the wedding of his eldest daughter; and, as we were guestfriends with him, it was impossible to decline, Tartar though he was. 
"I had a much better opinion of the Circassian women,' remarked Grigori Aleksandrovich. 
A poor, old greybeard strums on a threestringed instrumentI forget what they call it, but anyhow, it is something in the nature of our balalaika.[1] The girls and young children set themselves in two ranks, one opposite the other, and clap their hands and sing. 
"What was it she sangdo you remember?" 
'What is her name?' "Her name is Bela,' I answered. 
Pechorin, however, was not the only one who was admiring the pretty princess; another pair of eyes, fixed and fiery, were gazing at her from the corner of the room. 
'Surely it can't be my horse!' 
I squatted down beside the fence and proceeded to play the eavesdropper, trying not to let slip a single word. 
It would have been better for me to have abandoned him at the outskirts of the forest and concealed myself in it afoot, but it was a pity to part with himand the Prophet rewarded me. 
"Listen, Kazbich,' said Azamat, trying to ingratiate himself with him. 
How she dances! 
"Kazbich remained silent for a long, long time. At length, instead of answering, he struck up in an undertone the ancient song: "Many a beauty among us dwells From whose eyes' dark depths the starlight wells, 'Tis an envied lot and sweet, to hold Their love; but brighter is freedom bold. 
Four wives are yours if you pay the gold; But a mettlesome steed is of price untold; The whirlwind itself on the steppe is less fleet; He knows no treacheryno deceit."[2] [2] I beg my readers' pardon for having versified Kazbich's song, which, of course, as I heard it, was in prose; but habit is second nature. 
What had happened was this: Azamat had rushed in, with his tunic torn, saying that Kazbich was going to murder him. 
Once let them get drunk on buza, and there's certain to be bloodshed.' "We mounted and galloped home." 
As his usual custom was, he went to see Grigori Aleksandrovich, who always used to give him sweetmeats to eat. 
Every time that Azamat came it was the same story. 
I hope the transaction will be a profitable one for you.' 
"Won't you? 
"You agree?' 
I said as much to Pechorin afterwards, but he only answered that a wild Circassian girl ought to consider herself fortunate in having such a charming husband as himselfbecause, according to their ideas, he really was her husbandand that Kazbich was a scoundrel, and ought to be punished. 
I asked the staffcaptain. "One minute! One minute! 
Suddenly I saw Kazbich start, change countenance, and dart to the window; but unfortunately the window looked on to the back courtyard. 
My horse!' he cried, all of a tremble. "As a matter of fact I heard the clattering of hoofs. 
At the name of Azamat, Kazbich's eyes flashed, and he set off to the village where Azamat's father lived." [1] "No! 
I observed all that in a moment... 
"Ensign!' I said, as sternly as I could. 
If you only knew how I am being tortured with anxiety.' 
"Show her to me, though,' I said. 
"Did he really succeed in making her grow accustomed to him, or did she pine away in captivity from homesickness?" 
If so, I will let you go home at once.' 
They sparkled just like two glowing coals. 
Tell me, you will be more cheerful?' 
They have their own principles, they are brought up differently.' 
"Yes, I confess," he said after a while, tugging at his moustache, "I felt hurt that not one woman had ever loved me like that." 
I was involuntarily struck by the aptitude which the Russian displays for accommodating himself to the customs of the people in whose midst he happens to be living. 
Get on!" he shouted to the drivers. 
And he was right. We might just as easily have failed to arrive at all; but arrive we did, for all that. And if people would only reason a little more they would be convinced that life is not worth taking such a deal of trouble about. 
In the first place, this is not a novel, but a collection of travellingnotes, and, consequently, I cannot make the staffcaptain tell the story sooner than he actually proceeded to tell it. 
The drivers, shouting and cursing, belaboured the horses, which snorted, resisted obstinately, and refused to budge on any account, notwithstanding the eloquence of the whips. 
A story with such an unusual beginning must also have an unusual ending." 
"It is all very well for you to be glad, but, indeed, it makes me sad when I think of it. 
Always making fun of me, the little rogue! ... 
Grigori Aleksandrovich, as I think I have already mentioned, was passionately fond of hunting; he was always craving to be off into the forest after boars or wild goatsbut now it would be as much as he would do to go beyond the fortress rampart. 
"I tried to talk her over. 
"And with a burst of laughter, she seized her tambourine, began to sing, dance, and gambol around me. But that did not last long either; she fell upon the bed again and buried her face in her hands. 
"This was in September, and indeed it was a wonderful day, bright and not too hot. The mountains could be seen as clearly as though they were but a hand'sbreadth away. 
"Ah, the robber! 
"Hey, friend!' cried the sentry, waving his hand. 
Just as the powder flashed in the pan Kazbich jogged his horse, which gave a bound to one side. 
"He has gone away to die, your honour,' he answered. 
I know he was desperately fond of her a year agohe told me so himselfand, if he had had any hope of getting together a proper bridegroom's gift, he would certainly have sought her in marriage.' 
I hoped that under the bullets of the Chechenes boredom could not exista vain hope! 
In a month I grew so accustomed to the buzzing of the bullets and to the proximity of death that, to tell the truth, I paid more attention to the gnatsand I became more bored than ever, because I had lost what was almost my last hope. 
I replied that there were a good many people who used the same sort of language, that, probably, there might even be some who spoke in all sincerity; that disillusionment, moreover, like all other vogues, having had its beginning in the higher strata of society, had descended to the lower, where it was being worn threadbare, and that, now, those who were really and truly bored strove to conceal their misfortune as if it were a vice. 
Involuntarily I recalled to mind a certain lady, living in Moscow, who used to maintain that Byron was nothing more nor less than a drunkard. 
"I say, oughtn't we to be going back?' 
So, after a short rest, we set off homeward... 
"Oh, these young men! Always taking fire at the wrong moment! The shot rang out and the bullet broke one of the horse's hind legs. It gave a few fiery leaps forward, stumbled, and fell to its knees. 
We jumped off our horses and rushed to Bela. 
She was unconscious. 
"True!' I said, and we put our horses to a full gallop. 
"I shall die,' she said. 
The thought occurred to me to baptize her before her death. 
Still, this one thing grieves me, I must confess: she died without even once calling me to mind. Yet I loved her, I should think, like a father! ... 
"Early next morning we buried her behind the fortress, by the river, beside the spot where she had sat for the last time. Around her little grave white acacia shrubs and eldertrees have now grown up. 
Hereuponprobably to drown sad memorieshe launched forth into a lengthy dissertation on the unpleasantness of learning news a year late. 
On the way I involuntarily let the conversation turn on Bela and Pechorin. 
I offered to share my own room with him, and he accepted my hospitality without standing upon ceremony; he even clapped me on the shoulder and puckered up his mouth by way of a smilea queer fellow, that! ... 
"Thank heavens!" said Maksim Maksimych, who had come up to the window at that moment. 
"What a wonderful carriage!" he added; "probably it belongs to some official who is going to Tiflis for a judicial inquiry. 
No, my friend, you're not serious! They are not for the like of you; why, they would shake even an English carriage to bits! 
We went out into the corridor, at the end of which there was an open door leading into a side room. The manservant and a driver were dragging portmanteaux into the room. 
"Pechorin" "What did you say? 
"He'll be sure to come running up directly!" said Maksim Maksimych, with an air of triumph. "I will go outside the gate and wait for him! 
It was obvious that the old man was mortified by Pechorin's neglect, the more so because a short time previously he had been telling me of their friendship, and up to an hour ago had been convinced that Pechorin would come running up immediately on hearing his name. 
He threw his pipe on the table, began to walk up and down the room, and to rattle about at the stove. At last he lay down, but for a long time he kept coughing, spitting, and tossing about. 
I found him sitting on the little bench at the gate. 
His gait was careless and indolent, but I noticed that he did not swing his armsa sure sign of a certain secretiveness of character. 
To complete the portrait, I will add that he had a slightly turnedup nose, teeth of dazzling whiteness, and brown eyesI must say a few words more about his eyes. 
He was about to throw himself on Pechorin's neck, but the latter, rather coldly, though with a smile of welcome, stretched out his hand to him. For a moment the staffcaptain was petrified, but then eagerly seized Pechorin's hand in both his own. 
Have you retired? ... What? ... 
"Tell me," he continued, turning to me, "what do you think of it? 
It is true that for a long time we lived under one roof ... but aren't there plenty of people with whom I have lived?" ... 
The news afforded me great delight; it gave me the right to print these notes; and I have taken advantage of the opportunity of putting my name at the head of another person's productions. 
The driver stopped the tired troika[1] at the gate of the only stonebuilt house that stood at the entrance to the town. 
The headborough conducted us round the town. 
The shore descended precipitously to the sea, almost from its very walls, and down below, with incessant murmur, plashed the darkblue waves. 
I had with me, in the capacity of soldierservant, a Cossack of the frontier army. 
That is not the water plashing, you can't deceive meit is his long oars." 
He waved his hand, and all three set to work to drag something out of the boat. The cargo was so large that, to this day, I cannot understand how it was that the boat did not sink. 
I turned to the blind boy who was sitting in front of the stove, putting twigs into the fire. 
"Tell me, where were you roaming with the bundle last night, eh?" 
What are you touching him for? 
I raised my eyes. On the roof of my cabin was standing a young girl in a striped dress and with her hair hanging loosea regular waternymph. 
The sea I will hail With obeisance deep: "Thou base one, hark! 
The old woman grew angry, and the girl laughed loudly. 
"Whence the wind blows comes happiness." 
"He who baptized me knows." 
I had no suspicion then how momentous they were, but afterwards I had occasion to rue them. 
I am no lover of sentimental trips on the sea; but this was not the time to draw back. 
It was now rather dark; once or twice her head appeared for an instant amidst the sea foam, and I saw no more of her. I found the half of an old oar at the bottom of the boat, and somehow or other, after lengthy efforts, I made fast to the harbour. 
She was wringing the seafoam from her long hair. Her wet garment outlined her supple figure and her high bosom. 
Thank heaven an opportunity of getting away presented itself in the morning, and I left Taman. 
Upon the small square adjoining it a little house with a red roof over the bath is erected, and somewhat further on there is a gallery in which the people walk when it rains. 
Frequently they have many good qualities, but they have not a grain of poetry in their composition. 
I have seen him in action. He waves his sabre, shouts, and hurls himself forward with his eyes shut. 
I reciprocate Grushnitski's dislike. I feel that some time or other we shall come into collision upon a narrow road, and that one of us will fare badly. 
I am convinced that on the eve of his departure from his paternal village he said with an air of gloom to some pretty neighbour that he was going away, not so much for the simple purpose of serving in the army as of seeking death, because ... and hereupon, I am sure, he covered his eyes with his hand and continued thus, "No, youor thoumust not know! 
We met like a couple of old friends. 
They play whist, they dress badly and speak French dreadfully! 
They have been here only three days." 
For half an hour or so I walked about the avenues of the vines, the limestone cliffs and the bushes hanging between them. 
If there had been an attendant there he would have done the same thingand quicker too, in the hope of receiving a tip. 
He was poor, and dreamed of millions, but he would not take a single step out of his way for the sake of money. 
One of his legs was shorter than the other, as was the case with Byron. In comparison with his body, his head seemed enormous. His hair was cropped close, and the unevennesses of his cranium, thus laid bare, would have struck a phrenologist by reason of the strange intertexture of contradictory propensities. 
Of two friends, one is always the slave of the other, although frequently neither acknowledges the fact to himself. 
He sat down in an easy chair, placed his cane in a corner, yawned, and announced that it was getting hot out of doors. 
Here are you and I, both sensible men! We know beforehand that it is possible to dispute ad infinitum about everythingand so we do not dispute. Each of us knows almost all the other's secret thoughts: to us a single word is a whole history; we see the grain of every one of our feelings through a threefold husk. 
It appears that your history created a great stir there... 
"I never reveal my secrets myself, but I am exceedingly fond of their being guessed, because in that way I can always disavow them upon occasion. 
What sort of people are they?" 
"In the first place, Princess Ligovski is a woman of fortyfive," answered Werner. 
Princess Ligovski is taking the cure for her rheumatism, and the daughter, for goodness knows what. I have ordered each of them to drink two tumblers a day of sulphurous water, and to bathe twice a week in the diluted bath. 
"But I rely on you: you will not betray me. 
The pleasantest house at the waters! 
Russian ladies, for the most part, cherish only Platonic love, without mingling any thought of matrimony with it; and Platonic love is exceedingly embarrassing. 
Today I rose late. I went to the well. I found nobody there. 
"I knew that you were here," she said. 
"What then? 
He is young, handsome and, I suppose, richwhich is the chief thingand you are afraid?" ... I glanced at her and was alarmed. 
The road meanders between bushes and descends into little ravines, through which flow noisy brooks beneath the shade of tall grasses. 
[1] The Snake, the Iron and the Bald Mountains. 
At length they approached the slope; Grushnitski took hold of the bridle of the Princess's horse, and then I heard the conclusion of their conversation: "And you wish to remain all your life in the Caucasus?" said Princess Mary. 
"What is Russia to me?" answered her cavalier. "A country in which thousands of people, because they are richer than I, will look upon me with contempt, whilst herehere this thick cloak has not prevented my acquaintance with you" ... 
He continued: "Here, my life will flow along noisily, unobserved, and rapidly, under the bullets of the savages, and if Heaven were every year to send me a single bright glance from a woman's eyeslike that which" At that moment they came up to where I was. 
"But, do you know that you have made her terribly angry today? 
"We shall see" ... 
THE saloon of the restaurant was converted into the assembly room of a Nobles' Club. 
Spurs began to jingle, and skirts to rise and whirl. 
Her fresh breath touched my face; at times a lock of hair, becoming separated from its companions in the eddy of the waltz, glided over my burning cheek... I made three turns of the ballroom (she waltzes surprisingly well). 
A certain aidedecamp apparently saw the whole scene, but he concealed himself behind the crowd in order not to be mixed up in the affair. 
You think, perhaps, that I am drunk! 
I can dance all the easier, I assure you" ... 
I went up to the drunken gentleman, caught him none too gently by the arm, and, looking him fixedly in the face, requested him to retire. "Because," I added, "the Princess promised long ago to dance the mazurka with me." "Well, then, there's nothing to be done! 
The Princess went up to her mother and told her the whole story. The latter sought me out among the crowd and thanked me. 
Do you not think so?" 
She bent her head and blushed slightly. 
"You are a strange man!" she said, with a forced laugh, lifting her velvet eyes upon me. 
And yet you did not wish to make the acquaintance of Princess Mary otherwise than by saving her from certain death." 
He pressed my hand warmly, and said in a tragic voice: "I thank you, Pechorin... You understand me?" 
"What? But yesterday! 
I know you are experienced in these matters, you know women better than I... 
She entered the Ligovskis' drawingroom soon after us. 
Princess Ligovski presented me to her, as a relation of her own. 
Grushnitski and I left the house together. In the street he took my arm, and, after a long silence, said: "Well?" 
I OFTEN ask myself why I am so obstinately endeavouring to win the love of a young girl whom I do not wish to deceive, and whom I will never marry. 
I myself am no longer capable of committing follies under the influence of passion; with me, ambition has been repressed by circumstances, but it has emerged in another form, because ambition is nothing more nor less than a thirst for power, and my chief pleasure is to make everything that surrounds me subject to my will. To arouse the feeling of love, devotion and awe towards oneselfis not that the first sign, and the greatest triumph, of power? 
But what matter? ... 
"I do not congratulate you," he said to Grushnitski. 
Good gracious, Pechorin, what ideas you do have! ... 
And a wellbred woman, even if she is in love, will never say so" ... 
My choler rose. 
My colourless youth flowed by in conflict with myself and the world; fearing ridicule, I buried my best feelings in the depths of my heart, and there they died. 
To many, epitaphs in general seem ridiculous, but to me they do not; especially when I remember what reposes beneath them. I will not, however, ask you to share my opinion. 
I know the whole proceeding by heart alreadythat is what is so tiresome! CHAPTER IX 12th June. 
Do you not know, then? 
She seemed surprised and delighted. 
"You will be agreeably surprised tomorrow," I said to her. 
"That is a secret... 
As a result of that hard workthe collar of his uniform being very tight and uncomfortablehe grew red in the face. 
You know that such a thing is impossible! 
Whoever has seen you once will bear your divine image with him for ever." 
"But why give me hopes?" 
"Why did you hope? 
Grushnitski chose no one but the Princess, other cavaliers chose her every minute: obviously a conspiracy against meall the better! 
Surely I have not fallen in love with her in real earnest? ... 
And, in very fact, everything here breathes of solitude; everything has an air of secrecythe thick shadows of the linden avenues, bending over the torrent which falls, noisy and foaming, from flag to flag and cleaves itself a way between the mountains now becoming clad with verdurethe mistfilled, silent ravines, with their ramifications straggling away in all directionsthe freshness of the aromatic air, laden with the fragrance of the tall southern grasses and the white acaciathe neverceasing, sweetlyslumberous babble of the cool brooks, which, meeting at the end of the valley, flow along in friendly emulation, and finally fling themselves into the Podkumok. 
Many carriages have already driven bybut still there is no sign of that particular one. 
I am so stupidly constituted that such a thing might be expected of me. 
There is nothing more paradoxical than the female mind; it is difficult to convince a woman of anything; they have to be led into convincing themselves. 
For example, the usual way: "This man loves me; but I am married: therefore I must not love him." 
It is a wellknown fact that, in crossing rapid streamlets, you should never look at the water, because, if you do, your head begins to whirl directly. 
"Is that what you wish?" she continued, turning rapidly towards me.... 
There was something feverish in her movements; not once did she look in my direction. 
"Grushnitski is angry with him for having captured Princess Mary from him," somebody said. 
It would be amusing" ... 
Wait a bit; here is where the joke comes in... 
Or, is it your own position? ... 
However passionately I love a woman, if she only gives me to feel that I have to marry herthen farewell, love! 
What do I hope for from the future? ... 
Everyone intends to go and see the marvellous conjurer; even Princess Ligovski has taken a ticket for herself, in spite of her daughter being ill. 
I await you; come without fail." 
An invisible hand seized me by the shoulder. 
Within a minute I was in my own room, undressed and in bed. 
For the second time destiny provided me with the opportunity of overhearing a conversation which was to decide his fate. 
"I will tell you the whole truth," answered Grushnitski: "only please do not betray me. 
After that what can you believe? 
Bethink you well: if you maintain your present attitude, you will lose the right to the name of gentleman and will risk your life." 
The captain of dragoons, who was sitting beside him, nudged him with his elbow. Grushnitski started, and answered rapidly, without raising his eyes: "My dear sir, what I say, I mean, and I am prepared to repeat... 
'On no account will I agree,' Grushnitski was saying: 'he has insulted me publicly; it was quite a different thing before' ... 
I have thought it all out. 
They suddenly fell silent. 
"Doctor, I shall expect you tomorrow at four o'clock. The horses will be ready ... 
I am like a guest at a ball, who yawns but does not go home to bed, simply because his carriage has not come for him. 
I am like one who, spent with hunger, falls asleep in exhaustion and sees before him sumptuous viands and sparkling wines; he devours with rapture the aerial gifts of the imagination, and his pains seem somewhat assuaged. 
After all this, is life worth the trouble? 
I was not able to write for long: a secret uneasiness took possession of me. 
My nerves became composed. 
On my return, I found the doctor at my rooms. 
I burst out laughing when I saw that little figure under the enormous shaggy cap. Werner has a by no means warlike countenance, and on that occasion it was even longer than usual. 
The captain winked to Grushnitski, and the latter, thinking that I was losing courage, assumed a haughty air, although, until that moment, his cheeks had been covered with a dull pallor. 
For the first time since our arrival he lifted his eyes on me; but in his glance there was a certain disquietude which evinced an inward struggle. 
"Declare your conditions," he said, "and anything I can do for you, be assured" ... 
The doctor came up to me. 
"Gentlemen, this is becoming tedious," I said to them loudly: "if we are to fight, let us fight; you had time yesterday to talk as much as you wanted to." 
"Well, then, this is my idea. 
Do you see that narrow ledge on the top of the perpendicular cliff on the right? 
Whichever of us is wounded will be certain to fall down and be dashed to pieces; the doctor will extract the bullet, and, then, it will be possible very easily to account for that sudden death by saying it was the result of a fall. 
Let us cast lots to decide who shall fire first. 
Had the duel been fought upon the usual conditions, he could have aimed at my leg, wounded me slightly, and in such wise gratified his vengeance without overburdening his conscience. 
But now he was obliged to fire in the air, or to make himself an assassin, or, finally, to abandon his base plan and to expose himself to equal danger with me. 
Let us be off, then, gentlemen!" 
"I am surprised at you," said the doctor, pressing my hand vigorously. 
Suddenly small stones rolled noisily right under our feet. 
Who would not have concluded such an agreement with his conscience? 
One consideration alone might prevent him doing sothe thought that I would demand a second duel. 
His knees shook. 
"I cannot," he said in a hollow voice. 
"And you do not recant your slander? 
On seeing that, the captain spat and stamped his foot. "You are a fool, then, my friend," he said: "a common fool! ... 
Throwing down the bridle and letting my head fall on my breast, I rode for a long time, and at length found myself in a spot with which I was wholly unfamiliar. 
I opened the first; its contents were as follows: "Everything has been arranged as well as could be; the mutilated body has been brought in; and the bullet extracted from the breast. 
I have understood all that from the first... But you were unhappy, and I have sacrificed myself, hoping that, some time, you would appreciate my sacrifice, that some time you would understand my deep tenderness, unfettered by any conditions. 
But my love has been grafted with my soul; it has grown dark, but has not been extinguished. 
God knows what strange, what mad plans swarmed in my head... 
To see her? 
Why? 
That new suffering created within me a fortunate diversionto speak in military style. 
That little old manwhat's his name?has told her everything. 
He stopped on the threshold; he would gladly have pressed my hand ... and, had I shown the slightest desire to embrace him, he would have thrown himself upon my neck; but I remained cold as a rockand he left the room. 
They are all the same: they know beforehand all the bad points of an act, they help, they advise, they even encourage it, seeing the impossibility of any other expedientand then they wash their hands of the whole affair and turn away with indignation from him who has had the courage to take the whole burden of responsibility upon himself. 
"Princess," I said, "you know that I have been making fun of you? ... 
The situation was growing intolerable. Another minuteand I should have fallen at her feet. 
"So you see, yourself," I said in as firm a voice as I could command, and with a forced smile, "you see, yourself, that I cannot marry you. 
I thanked her, bowed respectfully, and left the room. 
A few versts from Essentuki I recognized near the roadway the body of my spirited horse. 
It has not yet learned that in a decent book, as in decent society, open invective can have no place; that our presentday civilisation has invented a keener weapon, none the less deadly for being almost invisible, which, under the cloak of flattery, strikes with sure and irresistible effect. 
But Russia, it appears, has been constituted in such a way that absurdities of this kind will never be eradicated. 
He has simply found it entertaining to depict a man, such as he considers to be typical of the present day and such as he has often met in real lifetoo often, indeed, unfortunately both for the author himself and for you. 
He lay quite still and silent while the pain in his scar subsided and disappointment washed over him. 
Glittering pink and silver winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of Gryffindor Tower. 
Resigned to the worst, he set off for Snape's office after dinner. 
'I didn't know,' he said, leering at Harry, who knew his face was burning. 
'Well, Draco, what is it?' asked Snape. 
The silvery lights shivered on the wall… Harry took two steps towards the desk, thinking hard. 
Harry looked around carefully. 
Snapetheteenager had a stringy, pallid look about him, like a plant kept in the dark. 
With another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the thumbsup. 
Thank you… thank you,' panted Professor Flitwick. 
He put his hand in his pocket and took out a struggling Golden Snitch. 
'I'm bored,' said Sirius. 
Lupin and Wormtail remained sitting: Lupin was still staring down at his book, though his eyes were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between his eyebrows; Wormtail was looking from Sirius and James to Snape with a look of avid anticipation on his face. 
'Wash out your mouth,' said James coldly. 
James's free hand immediately jumped to his hair. 
She had thick, dark red hair that fell to her shoulders, and startlingly green almondshaped eyesHarry's eyes. 
Behind him, the Impediment Jinx was wearing off. 
James sighed deeply, then turned to Snape and muttered the countercurse. 
'Apologise to Evans!' James roared at Snape, his wand pointed threateningly at him. 
'Evans!' James shouted after her. 
A hand had closed tight over his upper arm, closed with a pincerlike grip. 
Wincing, Harry looked round to see who had hold of him, and saw, with a thrill of horror, a fully grown, adultsized Snape standing right beside him, white with rage. 
'Ididn't' Snape threw Harry from him with all his might. 
'No,' said Harry, getting to his feet as far from Snape as he could. 
'So you've stopped having funny dreams?' said Hermione sceptically. 
'Well, I don't think Snape should stop until you're absolutely sure you can control them!' said Hermione indignantly. 
The smile faded from Ron's face. 
'We've got about as much chance of winning the Quidditch Cup this year as Dad's got of becoming Minister for Magic.' 
'What's wrong, Harry?' 
Yes, he had once overheard Professor McGonagall saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school, but she had described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins, and Harry could not imagine Fred and George dangling someone upsidedown for the fun of it… not unless they really loathed them… perhaps Malfoy, or somebody who really deserved it… Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had suffered at James's hands: but hadn't Lily asked, 'What's he done to you?' 
And hadn't James replied, 'It's more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean.' 
Ginny Weasley, looking very windswept, had joined him at the library table where he had been sitting alone. 
She sighed heavily. 
'Yeah, I'm fine,' said Harry gruffly. 
'I…' He glanced around to make quite sure nobody was listening. 
Harry looked at her. 
'Yeah…' said Harry, trying to sound casual, 'yeah, I thought I'd like' 'Don't be so ridiculous,' said Hermione, straightening up and looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes. 
He had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could come up with no alternative. 
Harry awoke very early the next day, feeling almost as anxious as he had done on the morning of his disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic. 
Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid emerging from between the trees. 
He seemed to be limping. 
With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridge's office ahead, Harry had never expected the day to be a restful one, but he had not reckoned on Hermione's almost continual attempts to dissuade him from what he was planning to do at five o'clock. 
Undeterred, she took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire warnings, all uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to waste five whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks. 
Her hands shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk. 
'Have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave Hogwarts?' 
Then you ought to do Charms, always useful, and Potions. 
'Poisons and antidotes are essential study for Aurors. 
'I just wondered whether I could make the teensiest interruption, Minerva?' 
She glanced down it, her eyebrows slightly raised, then placed it back into the folder without comment. 
Professor Umbridge's smile vanished as suddenly as a light bulb blowing. 
'Potter has a criminal record,' said Umbridge loudly. 
You think you'll be where I am, don't you: Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and Headmistress to boot!' 
There were screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them; people exiting the classrooms all around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfullyUmbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her. 
But he had made up his mind; hitching his bag more securely on to his shoulder, he set off at a run, weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing. 
He ducked inside the office, closed the door quickly behind him and looked around. 
Nothing was moving except the horrible kittens that were still frolicking on the wall plates above the confiscated broomsticks. 
It was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced. 
'Harry!' he said, looking thoroughly shocked. 
He wondered why Sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak out of the fire; his knees were already objecting painfully to their prolonged contact with Umbridge's hard stone floor. 
'He kept messing up his hair,' said Harry in a pained voice. 
'How come she married him?' Harry asked miserably. 
'She hated him!' 
'Yeah,' said Harry, surprised at what he considered a great overreaction. 
Til… I'll try and say something to him… but it won't be' He fell silent. 
Harry leapt to his feet and, making sure he had his bag and that the Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling along faster than Harry had ever seen him go. 
'I've got the form, Headmistress,' he said hoarsely, waving the piece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk. 
'Definitely,' said George. 
'STOP THEM!' shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. 
'Give her hell from us, Peeves.' 
Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes; Pansy Parkinson, to Hermiones delight, missed all her lessons the following day as she had sprouted antlers. 
That's all very well, but what if Montague's permanently injured?' 
'Montague shouldn't have tried to take all those points from Gryffindor, should he? 
'Why should I be worried about you?' 
'Well, if she does say that it'll be very unfair, you couldn't have done anything! But I'm sure she won't, I mean, if it's really true they've got premises in Diagon Alley, they must have been planning this for ages.' 
She'll want to know what they've been up to, to get their hands on that sort of gold.' 
'And I don't regret it, either. 
Harry interrupted her before she had even started. 
So save your breath, Hermione.' 
Once they had exhausted the subject of Fred and George's dramatic departure, which admittedly had taken many hours, Ron and Hermione had wanted to hear news of Sirius. 
Harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure; he had not, of course, dreamed anything of the sort. 
Last night, he had once again made the journey along the Department of Mysteries corridor. 
'You are trying to block your mind, aren't you?' said Hermione, looking beadily at Harry. 
The truth was he was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that room full of dusty orbs, that he was quite keen for the dreams to continue. 
The problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment devoted to revision, his mind seemed so saturated with information when he went to bed he found it very difficult to get to sleep at all; and when he did, his overwrought brain presented him most nights with stupid dreams about the exams. 
Harry, who had not forgotten this, merely grunted. 
They found seats in the topmost row of the stands. 
Lee Jordan, who had been very dispirited since Fred and George had left, was commentating as usual. 
He kept looking around nervously as they descended towards the lawn below. 
'Nah, well, we weren' goin' in so far then,' said Hagrid. 
The path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew so closely together as they walked further and further into the Forest that it was as dark as dusk. 
Any sound seemed threatening in the muffled silence. 
'Well, there's a good chance I'm goin' ter be gettin' the sack any day now,' he said. 
'On'y anythin' ter do with magical creatures and she thinks it's got somethin' ter do with me. 
Yeh know she's bin lookin' fer a chance ter get rid of me ever since I got back. 
'Look, I wouldn' be tellin' yer this at all if I didn' have ter. 
Harry looked from her to Hagrid and then, as realisation hit him, he looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror. 
'He's been hurting you all this time, hasn't he? 
That's why you've had all these injuries!' 
Harry and Hermione exchanged miserable looks, Harry uncomfortably aware that he had already promised Hagrid that he would do whatever he asked. 
The rim of a single large, fleshy ear was visible on top of the head, which seemed to sit, rather like Uncle Vernon's, directly upon the shoulders 
The legs were curled up under the body. 
Harry looked at Hermione, who peered back at him from between the fingers over her face. 
They looked up into his startlingly huge face that resembled a grey full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing. It was as though the features had been hewn on to a great stone ball. 
'Oh, Hagrid, don't,' moaned Hermione, but Hagrid had already raised the bough again and gave Grawp's knee a sharp poke. 
This,' said Hagrid, hastening over to where Harry and Hermione stood, 'is Harry, Grawp! 
He migh' be comin' ter visit yeh if I have ter go away, understand?' 
The giant had only just realised that Harry and Hermione were there. 
Two friends fer yeh terGRAWPY, NO!' 
'Righ',' said Hagrid thickly, getting up with one hand pinching his bleeding nose and the other grasping his crossbow, 'well… there yeh are… yeh've met him an'an' now he'll know yeh when yeh come back. 
Hagrid shouldered his crossbow again and, still pinching his nose, led the way back into the trees. 
'We agreed, I think, what we would do if this human ever showed his face in the Forest again?' 
It's not up ter yeh who comes and goes in here' 'No more is it up to you, Hagrid,' said Magorian smoothly. 
'Students, Magorian, from up at the school! 
'Ruddy old mules, though, eh?' 
'Oh, let's get in before we have to meet the Slytherins,' said Hermione. 
'And then, when Chambers came at me about five minutes laterWhat?' Ron asked, having stopped midsentence at the look on Harry's face. 
'Why are you grinning?' 
The truth was that Ron had just reminded Harry forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree. 
'Well, yeahmore out of temper than anything, though…' Ron frowned slightly. 
'Yeah?' said Ron, whose face was growing rather red. 
Ron gave a nervous laugh..•; 'And Hagrid wants us to…?' 
If he had, then Snape had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he was now ignoring Harry. 
She was not the only person acting oddly as the OWLs drew steadily nearer. 
I did nine and a half on Monday. 
'What's she like, Neville?' asked Hermione at once. 
'Don't be stupid,' she snarled. 
This information took the edge off Harry and Rons desire for brain stimulants. 
'But I daresay the Ministry of Magic will track him down soon enough.' 
He wished he had expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time was here. 
None of the fifthyears talked very much at breakfast next day, either: Parvati was practising incantations under her breath while the salt cellar in front of her twitched; Hermione was rereading Achievements in Charming so fast that her eyes appeared blurred; and Neville kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade. 
Trembling, she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle and Daphne Greengrass. 
Harry could not suppress a grin; Professor Tofty smiled back at him encouragingly. 
Here, for the first time, Harry felt sure he had passed. 
As Harry passed Umbridge beside the door, their eyes met. 
He was trying to guess what creatures they were examininghe thought it must be unicorns, because the boys seemed to be standing back a littlewhen the portrait hole opened and Hermione clambered in, looking thoroughly badtempered. 
'It could be the one mistake that makes the difference between a pass and a fail. 
Hermione's bad mood persisted for most of the weekend, though Harry and Ron found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of Saturday and Sunday revising for Potions on Monday, the exam which Harry had been looking forward to leastand which he was sure would be the downfall of his ambitions to become an Auror. 
The grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight and there was a slight chill in the air. 
If they had not been moving, and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads, they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they walked. 
Hermione was gazing transfixed at Hagrid's cabin. 
'How dare you!' the figure shouted as she ran. 
'It's McGonagall!' whispered Hermione. 
'Galloping gargoyles!' shouted Professor Tofty, who also seemed to have forgotten the exam completely. 
'I suppose so,' said Hermione, who looked tearful. 
'But why sack Hagrid now?' asked Angelina Johnson, shaking her head. 
Fred and George left me a couple; I've been levitating them in through her window.' 
The fifthyears entered the Great Hall at two o'clock and took their places in front of their facedown examination papers. 
'It happens, young man, it happens! 
'She's not here, Potter,' said Madam Pomfrey sadly. 
Dumbledore had gone, Hagrid had gone, but he had always expected Professor McGonagall to be there, irascible and inflexible, perhaps, but always dependably, solidly present… 'I don't wonder you're shocked, Potter,' said Madam Pomfrey, with a kind of fierce approval in her face. 
'I dunno how,' said Harry. 
'ButHarry…' said Ron weakly. 
'I dunno, Voldemort used an Invisibility Cloak or something!' Harry shouted. 
'He's got a point,' said Ron quietly, looking at Hermione. 
'But this is just — just so unlikely.' said Hermione desperately. 
'Sirius's brother was a Death Eater, wasn't he? 
That's not what I mean at all!' 
'But Harrywhat if your dream waswas just that, a dream?' 
'But Harry, you've just said it,' said Hermione fiercely, 'Dumbledore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind, if you'd done Occlumency properly you'd never have seen 
'Hi,' said Ginny uncertainly. 
Ginny raised her eyebrows. 
'Wait… Harry, they can help.' 
The Department of Mysteries?' said Luna, looking mildly surprised. 
Til tell her Peeves is smashing up the Transfiguration department or something, it's miles away from her office. 
'I mean, you cancan check whether Sirius is at home or not while I keep watch, I don't think you should be in there alone, Lee's already proved the windows a weak spot, sending those Nifflers through it.' 
'Right, well, even if we do all of that, I don't think we're going to be able to bank on more than five minutes,' said Hermione, looking relieved that Harry seemed to have accepted the plan, 'not with Filch and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around.' 
He scrambled through the portrait hole while they were still arguing about how many blackmarket Butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it, the Invisibility Cloak and Sirius's knife secure in his bag, before they noticed he had left them. 
'Harry, do you want to chip in a couple of Galleons? 
'I'm fine,' he said shortly, tugging the Invisibility Cloak from out of his bag. 
As they passed Ginny, Hermione whispered, 'Good one… don't forget 
They pulled off the Cloak; Hermione hurried over to the window and stood out of sight, peering down into the grounds with her wand out. 
His head began to spin as though he had just got off a iairground ride though his knees remained firmly planted on the cold office floor. 
'What has he come for, Kreacher wonders?' 
'Nobody here but Kreacher!' said the elf gleefully, and turning away from Harry he began to walk slowly towards the door at the end of the kitchen. 
And he scurried forwards and disappeared through the door to the hall. 
I have just found Potter using my fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown!' 
'You are being deliberately unhelpful! 
Where what is hidden? 
If Longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of tedious paperwork and I am afraid I shall have to mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a job.' 
He looked at Umbridge, who seemed to be feeling the same way; her chest was heaving with rage and frustration. 
'He never knew 1 ordered Dementors to go after Potter last summer, but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him, all the same.' 
Millicent stopped trying to squash her against the wall immediately and dodged out of her way looking disgusted. 
'Now then… with whom was Potter communicating just now?' 
The sun was falling towards the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now, and as Hermione marched purposefully across the grassUmbridge jogging to keep uptheir long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks. 
His scar was throbbing in the soft evening air but it had not yet burned whitehot, as he knew it would if Voldemort had moved in for the kill. 
Hermione was not taking the path they had followed to visit Grawp, but the one he followed three years ago to the lair of the monster Aragog. 
That's right!' said Umbridge, in an even higher voice, 'so be very careful! 
'Why are you here?' 
Her wand fell from her hand to the ground, and Harry's heart leapt. If he could just reach itBut as he stretched out a hand towards it, a centaur's hoof descended upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half. 
'Please,' said Hermione breathlessly, 'please, don't attack us, we don't think like her, we aren't Ministry of Magic employees! 
They already have the arrogance of their kind! 
'You said you didn't hurt the innocent!' shouted Hermione, real tears sliding down her face now. 
Hermione, however, gave a gasp. 
'I think he's trying to say "Hagrid"!' 
As Harry listened to them, his scar gave another great throb and a wave of terror swept over him. 
'We need to get back up to the castle,' said Hermione faintly. 
He knew Ron was thinking exactly what he was: if he could have chosen any members of the DA, in addition to himself, Ron and Hermione, to join him in the attempt to rescue Sirius, he would not have picked Ginny, Neville or Luna. 
'Is it those mad horse things?' said Ron uncertainly, staring at a point slightly to the left of the Thestral Harry was patting. 
Tour, Hermione,' said Ginny, scowling. 
Harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest Thestral licking his sleeve, which was damp with Grawp's blood. 
Harry did not think he had ever moved so fast: the Thestral streaked over the castle, its wide wings hardly beating; the cooling air was slapping Harry's face; eyes screwed up against the rushing wind, he looked round and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him, each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of their Thestral to protect themselves from his slipstream. 
He made as though to stride away from his Thestral, but, unable to see it, collided with its hindquarters and almost fell over again. 'Never, ever again… that was the worst' Hermione and Ginny touched down on either side of him: both slid off their mounts a little more gracefully than Ron, though with similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground; Neville jumped down, shaking; and Luna dismounted smoothly. 
'Where do we go from here, then?' she asked Harry in a politely interested voice, as though this was all a rather interesting daytrip. 
'Come on!' he urged the others, as they hesitated. 
Ron and Ginny marched in obediently; Hermione, Neville and Luna squashed themselves in after them; Harry took one glance back at the Thestrals, now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the skip, then forced himself into the box after Luna. 
Please state your name and business.' 
The floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose up past its glass windows; the scavenging Thestrals were sliding out of sight; blackness closed over their heads and with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the Ministry of Magic. 
Everything in here was black including the floor and ceiling; identical, unmarked, handleless black doors were set at intervals all around the black walls, interspersed with branches of candles whose flames burned blue; their cool, shimmering light reflected in the shining marble floor made it look as though there was dark water underfoot. 
Harry's eyes had blue streaks burned into them; it was all he could see. 
Hermione said urgently; but Harry had never needed her advice less, his instinct was to keep as quiet as possible. 
'Dunno,' said Harry. 
She sounded odd. 
They're brains.' 
This isn't right, we need to try another door.' 
There are doors here, too,' said Ron, pointing around the walls. 
'Wait!' said Hermione sharply, as Luna made to close the door of the brain room behind them. 
'Yeah…' Something finally slid back into place in his brain; Sirius, captured, bound and tortured, and he was staring at this archway… He took several paces back from the dais and wrenched his eyes from the veil. 
'Bound to be!' 
'Yeah,' breathed Harry, looking up at the end of the closest row. 
And he led them between the towering rows of glass balls, some of which glowed softly as they passed… 'He should be near here,' whispered Harry, convinced that every step was going to bring the ragged form of Sirius into view on the darkened floor. 
'Anywhere here… really close…' 'Harry?' said Hermione tentatively, but he did not want to respond. 
Harry did not want to look at any of them. 
There was no sign of Sirius anywhere, nor any hint of a struggle. 
In spidery writing was written a date of some sixteen years previously, and below that: S. P.T. to A. P.W. B.D. Dark Lord and (?)Harry Potter Harry stared at it. 
'What is it?' Ron asked, sounding unnerved. 
'None of the rest of us are here.' 
'It's something to do with me, isn't it?' 
'Don't, Harry,' said Neville suddenly. 
The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked: 'Accto proph —' 
Harry's mind was racing. 
'You'll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us,' he told Bellatrix. 
'Yeah,' said Harry, maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball, expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him. 
Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor. 
The Dark Lord, reveal himself to the Aurors, when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin?' 
'So, he's got you doing his dirty work for him, has he?' said Harry. 
Harry yelled, as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to fall from above. 
They could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters' robes drawing nearer, their feet moving rapidly. 
'Check under the desks,' said another. 
Both Harry's and the Death Eater's wands flew out of their hands and soared back towards the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in front, Harry hot on his heels, and Neville bringing up the rear, plainly horrorstruck by what he had done. 
Thanks,' he said. 
He was staring at the Death Eater's head in the bell jar. 
'Collo—' began Hermione, but before she could complete the spell the door had burst open and the two Death Eaters had come hurtling inside. 
'WE'VE GOT HIM!' yelled the Death Eater nearest Harry. 
'IN AN OFFICE OFF—' 'Silencio!' cried Hermione and the man's voice was extinguished. 
He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask, but no sound came out. 
Though he could no longer speak, his meaning could not have been clearer. 
A whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking properly: he had one hand on Hermione's shoulder, which was still warm, yet did not dare look at her properly. 
'My gran's going do kill be,' said Neville thickly, blood spattering from his nose as he spoke, 'dat was by dad's old wand.' 
Harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously. 
'He's never going to notice us,' he whispered. 
They walked a few steps forwards, Neville tottering slightly due to Hermione's weight; the door of the Time Room swung shut behind them and the walls began to rotate once more. 
The recent blow on the back of Harrys head seemed to have unsteadied him; he narrowed his eyes, swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again. 
But before they could make a decision as to which way to try, a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it. 
'Ron!' croaked Harry, dashing towards them. 
But Ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position, panting and holding her ankle. 
'Get Potter!' shrieked Bellatrix, and she ran at him; he dodged her and sprinted back up the room; he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy'Hey!' said Ron, who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly towards Harry, giggling. 
But nothing happened. 
'Letlet the others go, and I'll give it to you!' said Harry desperately. 
A few of the Death Eaters laughed. 
'You are not in a position to bargain, Potter,' said Lucius Malfoy, his pale face flushed with pleasure. 
STl/BE—' One of the largest Death Eaters seized Neville from behind, pinioning his arms to his sides. 
He struggled and kicked; several of the Death Eaters laughed. 
She looked transported, alive with excitement as she glanced at Harry, then back at Neville. 
She turned and gazed up at Harry. 
'Now, Potter, either give us the prophecy, or watch your little friend die the hard way!' 
Malfoy turned, and raised his wand, but Tonks had already sent a Stunning Spell right at him. 
'I dink he's all righdhe was still fighding de brain when I lefd' The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater right where Nevilles hand had been only seconds before; both scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere, seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright, so that his toes were barely touching the floor. 
'Accio proph —' Sirius had hurtled out of nowhere, rammed Dolohov with his shoulder and sent him flying out of the way. 
'Put your arm round my neck' Neville did soHarry heaved — Neville's legs were still flying in every direction, they would not support him, and then, out of nowhere, a man lunged at them: both fell backwards, Neville's legs waving wildly like an overturned beetle's, Harry with his left arm held up in the air to try to save the small glass ball from being smashed. 
The figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness. 
Harry released Neville, though he was unaware of doing so. 
Lupin turned away from the archway as he spoke. 
She had abandoned her baby voice now. `You need to mean them, Potter! 
MASTER, I TRIED, I TRIEDDO NOT PUNISH ME = `Don't waste your breath!' yelled Harry, his eyes screwed up against the pain in his scar, now more terrible than ever. `He can't hear you from here!' `Can't I, Potter?' said a high, cold voice. 
Meanwhile, the goblin and the houseelf scuttled towards the fireplaces set along the wall and the onearmed centaur galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reappeared beside the pool. 
The head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the wooden floor for a few seconds, then became still once more. `Now see here, Dumbledore!' said Fudge, as Dumbledore picked up the head and walked back to Harry carrying it. `You haven't got authorisation for that Portkey! 
If you need more help from me you are, of course, more than welcome to contact me at Hogwarts. 
'Thank you,' said Dumbledore softly. 
Sirius had appeared there once, disguised as the shaggy black dog, so he could watch Harry play … he had probably come to see whether Harry was as good as James had been… Harry had never asked him … `There is no shame in what you are feeling, Harry,' said Dumbledore's voice. `On the contrary… the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.' 
For a few seconds they stared at each other. `Let me out,' Harry said again. `No,' Dumbledore repeated. `If you don'tif you keep me in hereif you don't let me = `By all means continue destroying my possessions,' said Dumbledore serenely. `I daresay I have too many.' 
Harry roared. `I don't want to hear anything you've got to say!' `You will,' said Dumbledore steadily. `Because you are not nearly as angry with me as you ought to be. 
Harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but was unaware of it. 
I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort.' `You've told me this before, Professor,' said Harry bluntly. 
It became a matter of even greater urgency that you should master Occlumency' `But I didn't,' muttered Harry. 
He took Sirius at his word, and interpreted this as an order to leave the house. 
He remembered worrying about Kreacher's odd absence over Christmas, remembered him turning up again in the attic … 
Dumbledore heaved a great sigh and continued, `Alastor Moody, Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt and Remus Lupin were at Headquarters when he made contact. 
In the meantime he, Professor Snape, intended to search the Forest for you. `But Sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to search for you. 
He delegated to Kreacher the task of telling me what had happened. 
Kreacher injured Buckbeak the Hippogriff yesterday, and, at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire, Sirius was upstairs tending to him.' 
Sirius was not a cruel man, he was kind to houseelves in general.
He had no love for Kreacher, because Kreacher was a living reminder of the home Sirius had hated.' `Yeah, he did hate it!' said Harry, his voice cracking, turning his back on Dumbledore and walking away. 
I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.' 
You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but I realised. 
And I had to make my decision, too, with regard to the years ahead. 
I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. 
I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative.' `She doesn't love me,' said Harry at once. `She doesn't give a damn`But she took you,' Dumbledore cut across him. `She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. 
And yet, knowing how important it was that my plan should succeed, I told myself that I would not permit this flaw to ruin it. 
I had never intended to tell you when you were eleven. 
The silence within the office was absolute. 
This boy would be born to parents who had already defied Voldemort three times.' 
"It is with almost equal regret that we report the mass revolt of the Dementors of Azkaban, who have shown themselves averse to continuing in the Ministry's employ. 
He has insisted over the past year that YouKnowWho is not dead, as was widely hoped and believed, but is recruiting fol lowers once more for afresh attempt to seize power. 
Ginny, whose ankle had been mended in a trice by Madam Pomfrey, was curled up at the foot of Hermione's bed; Neville, whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size and shape, was in a chair between the two beds; and Luna, who had dropped in to visit, clutching the latest edition of The Quibbler, was reading the magazine upsidedown and apparently not taking in a word Hermione was saying. `He's the "boy who lived" again now, though, isn't he?' said Ron darkly. `Not such a deluded showoff any more, eh?' 
He helped himself to a handful of Chocolate Frogs from the immense pile on his bedside cabinet, threw a few to Harry, Ginny and Neville and ripped off the wrapper of his own with his teeth. 
Harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood as he left the dormitory. 
He was finding it hard to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not; whenever he was in company he wanted to get away and whenever he was alone he wanted company. 
Not scared of him, are you?T 'You think you're such a big man, Potter,' said Malfoy, advancing now, Crabbe and Goyle flanking him. `You wait. 
You can't land my father in prison = `I thought 1 just had,' said Harry. `The Dementors have left Azkaban,' said Malfoy quietly. `Dad and the others'll be out in no time…' `Yeah, I expect they will,' said Harry `Still, at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now = Malfoy's hand flew towards his wand, but Harry was too quick for him; he had drawn his own wand before Malfoy's fingers had even entered the pocket of his robes. `Potter!' 
You twoCrabbeGoyle = She beckoned them forwards imperiously and they came, shuffling their large feet and looking awkward. `Here,' said Professor McGonagall, thrusting her carpetbag into Crabbe's chest and her cloak into Goyle's; `take these up to my office for me.' 
He was worried that Dumbledore would make some reference to him in his speech. 
If you need to speak to me, just say my name into it; you'll appear in my mirror and I'll be able to talk in yours. 
James and I used to use them when we were in separate detentions. 
That's why it's not working… Harry remained quite still for a moment, then hurled the mirror back into the trunk where it shattered. 
They were all, clearly, in the Great Hall. 
Why?T 
Ginny told me.' 
You heard them.' 
They looked at each other. 
Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him; so much of what he had wanted before Sinus',' death felt that °av these days… the week that had elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, much longer; it stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in it, and the one without. `You're well out of it, mate,' said Ron forcefully. `I mean, she's quite goodlooking and all that, but you want someone a bit more cheerful.' `She's probably cheerful enough with someone else,' said Harry, shrugging. `Who's she with now, anyway?' 
Instead, he smiled, raised a hand in farewell, turned around and led the way out of the station towards the sunlit street, with Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and Dudley hurrying along in his wake. 
Who determined the shape of your body or the color of your eyes? Who created all other people, the heavens, Earth, and every living being in between? 
The majority of people never wonder if what they have heard is incorrect or mistaken. 
For this reason, in our endeavor to know Allah, we turn to the Qur’an, the most reliable and unique source, the just Book in which Allah explains everything a person needs to know. 
Allah is aware of what you do. 
Given that Allah, the AllKnowing, keeps His promise, all people will see the consequences of their wrong actions in the Hereafter. 
In one verse, Allah states the following: 
He who breaks his pledge only breaks it against himself. 
The Qur’an also reveals that our Lord, Who gives the best judgment, is infinitely just: 
How excellent is what Allah exhorts you to do! 
If they come to you, you can either judge between them or turn away from them. 
But Allah, Who created humanity and is fully aware of these mistakes, forgives them. 
If Allah were to punish people for their wrong actions, not a single creature would be left upon Earth, but He defers them until a predetermined time. 
Thus, those desiring His forgiveness must be sincere and resolute in their repentance. 
Given that He is infinite, He will exist for all eternity, existed in the infinite past, and is unaffected by time and space. This fact is stressed in the Qur’an, as follows: 
Consequently, Allah creates everything in compliance with His plan and for a divine purpose. 
But this is a delusion, for Allah, Who holds complete control over every point of the universe, knows what is in each person’s mind and everything else. 
You did not throw when you threw; it was Allah Who threw: so He might test the believers with this excellent trial from Him. 
Allah introduces Himself to us: Allah, the Creator of all the worlds and the sole Sovereign of the universe, is the Most High and the Possessor of the heavens, Earth, and everything in between. 
High is He, Exalted above all that they associate (with Him). 
People, all of whom are inherently feeble, can encounter all sorts of difficulties at any time, such as an earthquake, flood, hurricane, or volcanic eruption. 
Say: “Who rescues you from the darkness of the land and sea? You call upon Him humbly and secretly: ‘If you rescue us from this, we will truly be among the thankful.’” 
All that is created can only exist, survive, and act if He commands so. 
Allah is Almighty, Lord of Retribution. 
He makes likenesses of Us and forgets his own creation, asking: “Who will give life to bones when they are decayed?” 
Say: “He Who made them in the first place will bring them back to life. 
As these verses indicate, Allah created humanity and granted different qualities to everyone. 
Indeed, down to his or her fingerprints, each person has unique characteristics. 
The parallel features of these two resurrections are stated in several verses, as follows: He brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living, and brings Earth to life after it was dead. 
No doubt, this is a great blessing of Allah to His servants. 
The Everlasting 
This is also true of plants and animals. 
Or, for another reason, Allah will destroy this universe and keep His promise regarding the Day of Judgment. 
Anything you have been given is only the enjoyment of this world’s life and finery. 
Everything in the heavens and Earth glorifies Him. 
As scientific developments reveal more of its mysteries, we learn more about this equilibrium and harmony. 
When we examine life on Earth, we come across amazing details. 
Although this process continues without interruption, the amount of oxygen never decreases and the amount of carbon dioxide never increases. 
Thus, the oxygen consumed by people and animals is replaced by plants, a process that preserves this equilibrium. 
He is the EverReturning, the Most Merciful. 
Nothing holds them up but the AllMerciful. 
But this is a great delusion, for Allah sees even the smallest act. 
In the Qur’an, Allah informs us that He is aware of everything: 
Certainly Allah sees what you do. 
The Originator of the heavens and Earth. 
When He decides on something, He just says to it, “Be!” and it is. 
(For further reference, please see, Harun Yahya, For Men of Understanding, 3rd ed., [London: TaHa Publishers Ltd., April 2003]) 
Each person faces a particular direction, so race each other to the good. 
Truly, Allah has power over all things. 
In fact, a person needs to comprehend that Allah is AllMighty and that He created everything from nothing, grants every person’s characteristics and meets their needs, can take them all when He wills, and that all living beings will die while He alone will exist for all eternity. 
Maybe our Lord will give us something better than it in exchange. 
It may be that you hate something when it is good for you, and it may be that you love something when it is bad for you. 
Allah made this path clear through the Qur’an, which He revealed to our Prophet (saas). 
If Allah had not driven some people back by means of others, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, where Allah’s name is mentioned much, would have been pulled down and destroyed. 
Allah sends hardship and trouble so that a person can grow spiritually. 
This question has occupied the minds of people for centuries. 
Although many theses have been put forward for the universe’s existence, scientific circles have reached the following consensus: In 1929, Edwin Hubble revealed that the universe is in a state of constant expansion. 
That is Allah, so how are you deluded? 
But we cannot seriously assert that any seed has such faculties. 
“O My Lord, You have granted power to me on Earth and taught me the true meaning of events. 
Its location in space and its special structure, which meets the needs of all living beings, make it clear that this planet is the product of a superior wisdom. 
He Who created the seven heavens in layers. 
You will not find any flaw in the creation of the AllMerciful. Look again—do you see any gaps? 
If only the people of the cities had had faith and fear, We would have opened up to them blessings from heaven and Earth. But they denied the truth, so We seized them for what they earned. 
Allah gives many examples of the help He offers to believers. 
He sends Messengers who warn and inform them about what is allowed and what is prohibited. 
I am EverForgiving to anyone who repents, has faith, acts rightly, and then is guided. 
Allah, Who created humanity as well as space and time, is not bound by these concepts. 
Truly Allah has knowledge of the Hour, sends down abundant rain, and knows what is in the womb. 
Instead, they busy themselves with such mundane issues as their education, how to get promoted at work, or their children’s future. Of course such matters deserve some attention, but it is a great mistake to make them the goal of one’s life. 
Allah guides the members of the first group. 
Allah debases such people, for they choose this animallike life by refusing to exercise their conscience and think. 
Moreover, He continues to observe and protect this order. 
As we mentioned earlier, everything around us contains obvious signs of creation. 
We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. 
They are the people upon whom Allah will have mercy. 
Your Lord will gather them. 
The Truth, The Real That is because Allah—He is the Truth, and what you call upon besides Him is falsehood. 
As the Qur’an informs us, the only Truth is Him: 
Allah created every animal from water. 
The earlier ones also lived in the same way and the latter ones will continue to do so, for Allah determines a way of life for each living being. 
Therefore, no living being can determine how it will live, for this determination lies only with Allah, to Whom they all submit. 
Humanity is a tiny part of life, a being Allah created from a drop of water and granted a way of life. 
Or have they assigned partners to Allah, Who creates as He creates, so that all creating seems the same to them?” 
Islam is easy to practice, another expression of Allah’s infinite mercy. 
On the other hand, believers grasp our Lord’s greatness, glorify Him, and thank Him for the blessings He grants, for they know that He expects them to be thankful servants. 
Musa said: “If you were to be ungrateful, you and everyone on Earth, Allah is Rich Beyond Need, Praiseworthy.” 
Those who have been given knowledge see that what has been sent down to you from your Lord is the truth and that it guides to the Path of the Almighty, the Praiseworthy. 
Those nine months spent in the mother’s womb is utterly a dark period, for no one knows all of the miraculous events that occur during that time. 
Thus, we need to remember that He is with us all the time. 
Being weak, what we can actually do is very limited. 
He supports them with His help, love, and mercy, and also alleviates their tasks. 
He is indeed wrongdoing and ignorant. 
He knows that humanity is fallible, ignorant, and ungrateful, and yet He is always compassionate and merciful toward people. 
The likeness of ‘Isa in Allah’s sight is the same as Adam. 
He created the heavens and Earth with truth. 
But Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger, so We seized him with terrible severity. 
Is Allah not sufficient for His servant? 
There is no deity but Him—He gives life and causes to die—your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers, the previous peoples. 
As Allah informs us, He is the One God. 
Or are darkness and light the same? 
Those who do not want to acknowledge their responsibility to Allah and do not perform the deeds that He demands from them believe that this belief provides a way to escape their responsibilities. 
Allah keeps a firm hold on the heavens and Earth, preventing them from vanishing. 
My Lord is Close and Quick to Respond. 
Allah manifests His infinite compassion and mercy by meeting the needs of all that exists and allocating His mercy among all living beings. 
Allah created various blessings for our survival and provides for all of our needs. 
Indeed, Allah calls attention to this important fact: 
He is Most Strong, Severe in Retribution” (Surah Ghafir, 40:22), most of the nations called Allah’s wrath upon themselves by denying and rejecting His Messengers. 
Allah is AllStrong, Almighty. 
Allah is Most Strong, Almighty. 
Their greeting there is: “Peace!” The end of their call is: “Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds!” 
Allah is the AllHigh, the Most Great. 
Each person, once a lump of flesh in his or her mother’s womb, is born, grows up, and manifests Allah’s artistry with his or her beautiful face. 
We created man from a mingled drop to test him, and made him able to hear and see. 
These people reach the following conclusion: Our Lord, Who created them and granted all of the superior blessings that they could never attain on their own, is very generous. 
And if they vanished, no one could then keep hold of them” (Surah Fatir, 35:41), He regulates and protects all of the various universes’ existing systems. 
If we become too tired, are deprived of sleep for a few days, or do not drink for a prolonged time, we become weak. 
In many verses, Allah relates that the majority of people will not have faith and will not attain the straight path. 
No doubt, Allah’s sending His Messengers and Books in order to guide humanity is one of His favors. 
Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the sky and then, in the morning, the land is covered in green? 
"My son, even if something weighs as little as a mustardseed and is inside a rock, or anywhere else in the heavens or Earth, Allah will bring it out. 
On the Day of Judgment, people will be resurrected and gathered together to account for their deeds. 
That is because “Allah will certainly help Messengers and those who believe both in the life of the world and on the Day the witnesses appear.” (Surah Ghafir, 40:51) 
A flower grows by combining such favorable circumstances as sunlight, water, and so on, all of which are granted by Allah. 
Once you opened your eyes to this world, you saw both the flawless system in your body and in the universe. 
Despite all of our weaknesses, along with their feelings of superiority, they grow arrogant and attempt to deny our Creator. 
However, due to their arrogance, they do not believe. 
Clouds that carry tons of water in the sky, stars that are millions of light years away from us, waterfalls that fall with an enormous noise and intensity, unbounded oceans, mountains with snowy summits extending high into the sky, woods that are inhabited by living beings of countless colors, and noises are only a few of the beauties created by Allah. 
Respond to your Lord before a Day comes from Allah that cannot be turned back. 
Some believe that Allah initially created everything and then left them to their own devices; others argue that although Allah created us, we do not have to feel any responsibility toward Him. 
Oceans, the greatest source of life, will become like boiling water and then burst into flame. 
Through these events on the Day of Judgment, our Lord will show His power to all people. Those who insisted upon unbelief will finally comprehend His infinite power. 
Several factors account for this serenity, among them is the believers’ awareness that Allah hears every prayer, knows every good deed performed to earn His good pleasure, and that He will reward all of them bountifully. 
Allah leaves behind and brings forward whoever He wills. 
Despite all of the surrounding evidence, those who have no faith in Allah and who insist upon disregarding His grandeur and power surely deserve a great punishment, for Allah created us, placed us on Earth, and provided us with whatever we need. 
Their fearsome punishment in the Hereafter will continue to exist, unless Allah wills otherwise, for all eternity. 
Thus, He is the One Who can give the most suitable punishment. According to the following verses: 
But as for those who are deviators, their refuge is the Fire. 
We will give them a taste of lesser punishment before the greater punishment, so that hopefully they will turn back. 
Allah gives the good news of His infinite mercy to His servants who sincerely repent: 
He removes their sadness, for He is their friend and helper. 
That Day some faces will be radiant, laughing, rejoicing. 
Those are the dissolute unbelievers. 
While this is a great blessing for believers, it is a fearsome trap for unbelievers, who do not realize the enormity of their spiritual blindness, for: 
What they achieved here will come to nothing. 
He has counted them and numbered them precisely. 
The metaphor of those who spend their wealth in the Way of Allah is that of a grain that produces seven ears; in every ear are a hundred grains. 
He gives life and causes to die, and you will be returned to Him. 
As soon as the sperm destined to fertilize the egg enters the ovum, a membrane covers the egg and a new life begins. 
Allah divides this tiny cell first into two and then into four. This process proceeds rapidly, and the end result is a miraculous life starting in the mother’s womb. 
He has total knowledge of each created thing.” 
Today the unbelievers have despaired of overcoming your religion. So do not be afraid of them, but be afraid of Me. 
Make a metaphor for them of the life of the world. It is like water that We send down from the sky and the plants of the earth combine with it, but then become dry chaff scattered by the winds. 
Allah has absolute power over everything. 
In most cases, Allah may delay His punishment upon those people who were warned, and thus were informed of the truth, to give them more time to acquire faith and purify themselves. 
On the day We launch the Great Assault, We will certainly inflict Our retribution. 
These are Allah’s Signs, which We recite to you with truth. 
Allah does not want to make things difficult for you; rather, ... He wants to purify you and perfect His blessing upon you so that hopefully you will be thankful. 
Yet this multifunctional system is only one of the perfect systems existing in the human body. 
“Our Lord gives each thing its created form and then guides it.” 
But Allah, Who is compassionate and merciful toward His servants, answers all of our questions through His revelations. 
Indeed, the calls, warnings, recommendations, and prohibitions revealed by Him, as well as the issues to which He draws people’s attention, are for our salvation and will enable us to give a joyful account in Allah’s presence on the Day of Judgment. 
In addition, no other book informs people about the life of the Hereafter. 
The Ruler, the Director, Who governs all of creation with order and balance 
In addition, human life relies on countless external factors that are ruled by Allah with great order and balance. 
Allah keeps a firm hold on the heavens and Earth, preventing them from vanishing. 
Indeed, Allah gives spiritual peace and security to sincere believers. 
Allah describes this unique state of material and spiritual contentment, as follows: 
Man prays for evil just as he prays for good. Man is prone to be impetuous. 
Newton’s law of gravitation, which explains the delicate balance between the orbits of Earth, the Moon, and the planets, is another example. 
In a world without friction, all knots would unfasten, nails and screws would come out, brakes would never function, and sounds would continue to resound from one wall to another... 
Another example is Earth’s secure and strong structure. 
And if a fly steals something from them, they cannot get it back. 
Our command is only one word, like the blinking of an eye. 
He is the King, the Most Pure, the Perfect Peace, the Trustworthy, the Safeguarder, the Almighty, the Compeller, the Supremely Great. 
Allah replied: "You will not see Me, but look at the mountain. If it remains firm in its place, then you will see Me.” The rest of the account is related, as follows: 
Know that Allah is Almighty, AllWise.” 
That morning, He destroyed the unbelieving nation and rescued Prophet Lut (as). 
He Who created you and formed you and proportioned you. 
Allah made Earth a stable home for you and the sky a dome, formed you, gave you the best of forms, and provided you with good and wholesome things. 
Even the human body displays Allah’s perfect artistry. 
He created and molded. (Surat alA‘la, 87:2) 
It makes no difference if you call them or stay silent. 
My Protector is Allah, Who sent down the Book. He takes care of the believers.” 
Allah will give the believers an immense reward. 
Allah is the most compassionate of the Compassionate. 
Allah desires ease for you; He does not desire difficulty for you. 
He has selected you and has not placed any constraint upon you in religion—the religion of your forefather Ibrahim... 
But as for him who is stingy, selfsatisfied, and denies the Good, We will pave his way to difficulty. 
Allah will punish them at your hands, disgrace them, help you against them, and heal the hearts of those who believe. 
We will come to them with troops they cannot face, and will expel them from it, abased and humiliated." 
One point deserves special mention here: Allah’s Messengers used their wealth to attain His good pleasure by doing good deeds. 
Vessels of silver and goblets of pure crystal will be passed round among them, crystalline silver—they have measured them very exactly. 
We supported them, and so they were the victors. 
In this way, We have assigned to every Prophet an enemy from among the evildoers. 
Any who do not believe after that, such people are deviators. 
In houses that Allah has permitted to be built and in which His name is remembered, there are men who proclaim His glory morning and evening. 
For the unbelievers, however, there is not a single source of “illumination.” 
The following verse reveals that these two groups are mirror opposites and believers are absolutely superior, for: 
That is how what they were doing is made to seem attractive to the unbelievers. 
His Messengers and the just Books that they bring are all sources of “light.” 
By it, Allah guides those who follow what pleases Him to the ways of peace. He will bring them from the darkness to the light by His permission, and guide them to a straight path. 
And a wall will be erected between them with a gate in it, on the inside of which there will be mercy but before whose exterior lies punishment. 
He calls down blessing upon you, as do His angels, to bring you out of the darkness and into the light. 
He will give you a double portion of His mercy, grant you a Light by which to walk, and forgive you. 
These universes, all works of His artistry and infinite power, are far beyond our wisdom and imagination. 
Both creation and command belong to Him. 
But they persevered, for these chosen servants of Allah were “on a sure footing with the Lord” (Surah Yunus, 10:2) and wholly submitted to Him. 
The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful 
Allah creates every one of the 100 trillion cells that make up the human body and then teaches every one of them their individual tasks; places DNA, which comprises information that would fill a million pages, in the cell; makes this system operate through protein, fat, and water molecules that He puts in a cube far smaller than 1 millimeter (0.03 inch); and gives each person a soul and keeps them alive until He wills otherwise. 
In the Hereafter, however, all blessings belong to believers who strove to draw near to Allah and earn His good pleasure while in this arena of testing. They give thanks to our Lord, for Allah is the Most Gracious and gives the good news of Paradise only to His faithful servants. 
Just as a person cannot take a step without Allah’s will, that cell cannot function without His will. 
Aside from these attributes, one notices that whatever has been created to serve humanity is also superior. 
The AllProvider 
And, after a life of hardship, you would die. 
But since Allah is Most Gracious, Most Merciful, it is impossible to number His blessings. He commands in the Qur’an, as follows: 
Do those who take the hypocrites as protectors, rather than the believers, hope to find power and strength with them? 
"When you ask, ask from Allah; when you seek help, seek it of Allah.” (Hadith atTirmidhi) 
In the Qur’an, Allah makes promises to both believers and unbelievers. 
Allah’s promise is true. 
Humanity was created to serve Allah and has been placed here to be tested. 
The wrongdoers are in an everlasting punishment. 
In one verse, Allah relates that every person will receive whatever he or she deserves, as follows: 
And if there is a good deed, Allah will multiply it and pay out an immense reward direct from Him. 
No doubt, these manifest Allah’s attribute of al‘Aleem. 
All organs are placed in the most appropriate place. For instance, the places of the eyes and the heart, the latter of which is protected by the sternum, are entrusted with many divine purposes. 
Such uniqueness is a clear sign of His artistry. 
No doubt, the blissful life in both worlds manifests Allah’s attribute of asSalam upon His faithful servants. 
A believer who is devoted to Allah and does good deeds to attain His good pleasure will return to His Lord “...well pleasing and well pleased” (Surat alFajr, 89:28). Allah describes what such servants will find in the Hereafter, as follows: 
He is the AllHearing, the AllSeeing. 
He is the One Who Hears, the One Who Knows. 
For example, they are signs of a purposeful and superior creation and of His power, for how else can one explain the existence of microscopic viruses? 
The kingdom of the heavens and Earth is His. 
Those who have faith in Allah and yet associate partners with Him assume that these partners will intercede for them on the Day of Judgment. According to their belief, such “guardians” will take responsibility for their followers or purify them. 
Remind [them] by it [the Qur’an], lest a person is delivered up to destruction for what he has earned with no protector or intercessor besides Allah. Were he to offer every kind of compensation, it would not be accepted from him... 
Allah created the heavens and Earth and everything between them in six days, and then established Himself firmly upon the Throne. 
Despite this, however, the majority of people have no faith. 
This right path, which is attained by following one’s conscience, is a blessing granted to sincere believers. 
Allah gives countless blessings to us and only asks each of us to be a grateful servant. 
For this reason, we should never lose hope, regardless of what we have done. 
He is the EverForgiving, the Most Merciful.” 
They devote their lives to acquiring wealth and never once wonder if Allah is pleased with them. They consider people, other beings, or particular objects as equal to Allah and so clearly associate partners with Him. 
And if a fly steals something from them, they cannot get it back. 
It was We Who were their Heir. 
Yet one day, at a totally unexpected moment, they will face the angels of death. 
Allah is AllEncompassing, AllKnowing.”(Surat alBaqara, 2:115) 
As His mercy and compassion are vast, He encompasses His faithful servants with His mercy and protects them. 
My Lord is Most Merciful, Most Loving. 
They can ask their Lord for anything that will draw them nearer to Him. 
He said: “My Lord, forgive me and give me a kingdom the like of which will never be granted to anyone after me. 
You are the EverGiving. 
This metaphysical phenomenon is incomprehensible to unbelievers. 
Allah is the Protector of those who believe. 
This friend never abandons them, is next to them, and helps them in the face of every difficulty. 
And remember when two of your clans were on the point of losing heart and Allah was their Protector. 
Blessed be the name of your Lord, Master of Majesty and Generosity. 
Have they not looked at the birds above them, with wings outspread and folded back? 
Nothing holds them up but the AllMerciful. 
According to the theory, inanimate matter must have produced a living cell as a result of coincidences. 
For a long time, advocates of the theory of evolution resisted these findings. 
Today as we leave the twentieth century, we still face the biggest unsolved problem that we had when we entered the twentieth century: How did life originate on Earth?5 
Darwin based his evolution allegation entirely on the mechanism of “natural selection.” 
So, how could these “favorable variations” occur? 
Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world is NeoDarwinism. 
This fact shows us that there is no “evolutionary mechanism” in nature. 
However, recent findings of paleoanthropologists have revealed that Australopithecus, Homo habilis, and Homo erectus lived at different parts of the world at the same time.15 
Moreover, a certain segment of humans classified as Homo erectus have lived up until very modern times. Homo sapiens neandarthalensis and Homo sapiens sapiens (modern man) coexisted in the same region.16 
Lord Solly Zuckerman, one of the most famous and respected scientists in the U. K., who carried out research on this subject for years and studied Australopithecus fossils for 15 years, finally concluded, despite being an evolutionist himself, that there is, in fact, no such family tree branching out from apelike creatures to man. 
According to Zuckerman’s spectrum, the most “scientific”—that is, depending on concrete data—fields of science are chemistry and physics. 
The tale of human evolution boils down to nothing but the prejudiced interpretations of some fossils unearthed by certain people, who blindly adhere to their theory. 
If you like, let us formulate an “experiment” on this subject and let us examine on the behalf of evolutionists what they really claim without pronouncing loudly under the name “Darwinian formula”: 
Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the eye’s retina. 
So, it certainly follows that the theory of evolution should be pushed aside as an unscientific idea. 
Some people even try to represent criticisms directed against it as an “attack on science.” 
As for those who do not believe, it makes no difference to them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe. 
How could it be jinxed?" 
"I said I wonder what's wrong with Lupin, and you" "Well, isn't it obvious?" said Hermione, with a look of maddening superiority. 
Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that Harry should do the same. 
Certainly, nothing that had happened to him at the Dursleys' was going to do. 
"Right, thenready to try it on a dementor?" 
A wave of piercing cold broke over him"Expecto patronum!" Harry yelled. 
Harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against it. 
"It's getting worse," Harry muttered, biting off the Frog's head. 
"II did, as a matter of fact," said Lupin. 
He got up again. 
The screaming inside Harry's head had started againexcept this time, it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radiosofter and louder and softer againand he could still see the dementorit had haltedand then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the end of Harry's wand, to hover between him and the dementor, and though Harry's legs felt like water, he was still on his feetthough for how much longer, he wasn't sure"Riddikulus!" roared Lupin, springing forward. 
"Can we have another go? 
You'd better be off, Harry, it's getting late." 
"They're dead," he told himself sternly. 
This meant that with Lupin's antidementor classes, which in themselves were more draining than six Quidditch practices, Harry had just one night a week to do all his homework. 
"Getting to all her classes!" Ron said. 
They were going on about yesterday's lesson, but Hermione can't 've been there, because she was with us in Care of Magical Creatures! 
And Ernie McMillan told me she's never missed a Muggle Studies class, but half of them are at the same time as Divination, and she's never missed one of them either!" 
"For a thirteenyearold wizard, even an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. 
"Butterbeer!" said Harry, without thinking. 
I see," said Lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious. 
And your soul is gone forever... lost." 
It was in the Daily Prophet this morning. 
"Do you really think anyone deserves that?" 
"Seriously," said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. 
"You know whatwe should make up with Hermione.... 
"Oh, shut up," said Ron as he and Harry drew level with Neville. 
Harry and Ron approached her table and at last, she looked up. 
"I mean, at least you know now that it's safe!" 
"Yeah, I suppose so," said Harry. 
Harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the long Arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies essay ("Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity" and at the rune translation Hermione was now poring over. 
"How are you getting through all this stuff?" Harry asked her. 
"I couldn't do that!" said Hermione, looking scandalized. 
It's" But exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy, Harry never found out. 
Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and when he tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence all pointed that way, she lost her temper with Harry too. 
I learned to fly on one, and a very fine old broom it was too...." 
Harry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked out of the shadowy stadium, discussing the Firebolt's superbly smooth action, its phenomenal acceleration, and its pinpoint turning. 
"She's still letting him wander about wherever he wantsprobably washing down Scabbers with a couple of birds now...." 
"Harrymake sure you win," said Percy, in an urgent whisper. 
It was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze; there would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry, though nervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch match could bring. 
She smiled at Harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he didn't think had anything to do with nerves. 
Harry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Ravenclaw goal posts and Cho fell behind. 
There was a great "Ooooooh" of disappointment from the Gryffindor supporters, but much applause for their Beater from the Ravenclaw end. 
Potter's really putting it through its paces now, see it turnChang's Comet is just no match for it, the Firebolt's precisionbalance is really noticeable in these long" "JORDAN! 
Harry dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a Ravenclaw Chaser, scanning the field franticallya glint of gold, a flutter of tiny wingsthe Snitch was circling the Gryffindor goal postHarry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold aheadbut just then, Cho appeared out of thin air, blocking him"HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!" 
"That's my boy!" Wood kept yelling. 
"Well done, Harry!" said Percy, looking delighted. 
"And I'm very glad we won, and I think you did really well, but I need to read this by Monday." 
He had a very strange dream. 
With a knife!" 
"Look at the curtains! 
My brother Ron here had a nightmare" "IT WASN'T A NIGHTMARE!" Ron yelled. 
"Ask him if he saw" Glaring suspiciously at Ron, Professor McGonagall pushed the Portrait back open and went outside. 
"Certainly, good lady!" cried Sir Cadogan. 
"He had them!" said Sir Cadogan proudly. 
She was white as chalk. 
His portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and the Fat Lady was back. 
A bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her. 
"We know he's not coming in through Honeyduke's," said Ron dismissively. 
If the oneeyed witch was boarded up too, he would never be able to go into Hogsmeade again. 
I woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down.... I rolled over... and I saw him standing over me... like a skeleton, with loads of filthy hair ... holding this great long knife, must've been twelve inches... and he looked at me, and I looked at him, and then I yelled, and he scampered. 
"He'd've had to kill the whole House to get back through the portrait hole... then he would' ve met the teachers...." 
The note inside said: Dear Harry and Ron, How Abut having tea with me this afternoon around six? 
Hagrid was already waiting for them. 
Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight, Harry saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellowandorange tie hanging from the top of Hagrid's wardrobe door. 
"Buckbeaks case against the Committee fer the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures," said Hagrid. 
Harry felt a nasty pang of guilt. 
She's bin comin' down ter visit me a lot since Chris'mas. Bin feelin' lonely. 
I've seen yeh practicin' Quidditch ev'ry hour of the day and nightbut I gotta tell yeh, I thought you two'd value yer friend more'n broomsticks or rats. 
Harry started and looked around at Hermione, who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her. 
Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss, Crookshanks leapt onto her lap. 
Harry squinted at it. 
"I don't understand that thing about the garlic at alldo they have to eat it, or" He broke off with a small gasp, looking over Harry's shoulder. 
They went to the post office; Ron pretended to be checking the price of an owl to Bill in Egypt so that Harry could have a good look around. 
Then they visited Zonko's, which was so packed with students Harry had to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic. 
The day was fine and breezy, and neither of them felt like staying indoors, so they walked past the Three Broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the Shrieking Shack, the most haunted dwelling in Britain. 
"What are you doing, Weasley?" 
"Leave him to me," he hissed in Ron's ear. 
Harry doubled up with silent laughter as Crabbe did a kind of pirouette in midair, trying to see who had thrown it. As Ron was the only person Crabbe could see, it was Ron he started toward, but Harry stuck out his leg. 
Harry felt a great tug, then the cloak slid off his face. 
Ron said, stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point where Harry had disappeared, "you'd better run for it! 
There was a look of surpressed triumph about him. 
They walked down the stairs to the dungeons and then into Snape's office. 
"No," said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious. 
"So," he said, straightening up again. 
"How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter," Snape said suddenly, his eyes glinting. 
His head was so swollen" "SHUT UP!" 
Then let me correct youyour saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father hadn't got cold feet at the last moment. 
He was saving his own skin as much as mine. 
Harry didn't move. 
"Hebrought them back from Hogsmeade last time" "Indeed? 
Snape turned it over, his eyes on Harry. 
"Full of Dark Magic?" he repeated mildly. 
"Harry, do you know any of these men?" 
"No," said Harry quickly. 
Harry took it. 
Hagrid "They can't do this," said Harry. 
Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head. 
You never know, Mum and Dad might get me an owl now." 
Their only chance of talking to him was during Care of Magical Creatures lessons. 
"Don't give up Yet, we're working on it!" 
Ahead they could see Malfoy, who was walking with Crabbe and Goyle, and kept looking back, laughing derisively. 
I'm jus' gonna make sure the rest of Beaky's time is the happiest he's ever had. 
I owe him that...." 
"You just better had, because I can't stand it if Slytherin wins!" 
"You're late, boys!" said Professor Flitwick reprovingly as Harry opened the classroom door. 
Harry looked around too. 
But Hermione didn't turn up all lesson. 
Wwhich lesson have we got now?" 
"No, I'm not!" said Hermione, brushing her hair out of her eyes and staring hopelessly around for her bag. 
I'd better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry... 
"This is such a waste of time," Hermione hissed. 
I don't need help," Ron whispered. 
And to the whole class's amazement, Hermione strode over to the trapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed down the ladder out of sight. 
Professor Trelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the Grim. 
The Inner Eye can be a burden, you know..." 
"Some day Hermione's having, eh?" Ron muttered to Harry, looking awed. 
The last thing he needed was another nearfatal accident, with the Quidditch final drawing ever nearer. 
You've got that, Haven't you? 
You must catch the Snitch only if we're" "I KNOW, OLIVER!" Harry yelled. 
"You're going to be fine," Hermione told him, though she looked positively terrified. 
First he dreamed that he had overslept, and that Wood was yelling, "Where were you? 
The grounds were still and quiet. 
Harry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed when something caught his eye. 
"What're you or, about?" 
"Down here" Harry looked quickly back out of the window. 
Harry noticed that Malfoy looked even paler than usual. 
"Good luck, Harry!" called Cho. 
In what seemed like no time at all, Wood was saying, "Okay, it's time, let's go" They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. 
Widely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has seen in a good few years" Lee's comments were drowned by a tide of "boos" from the Slytherin end. 
He's Made some changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill" More boos from the Slytherin crowd. 
Flint's nose smashed into the handle of his broom and began to bleed. 
Penalty shot to Slytherin for deliberate damage to their Chaser!" 
Katie cart wheeled in the air, managed to stay on her broom, but dropped the Quaffle. 
One of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry's right ear, hit by the gigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick. 
But Flint had scored; there was an eruption of cheers from the Slytherin end, and Lee swore so badly that Professor McGonagall tried to tug the magical megaphone away from him. 
And Angelina scored. 
Lee Jordan was howling into the megaphone, dancing out of Professor McGonagall's reach. 
"YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B" Pprofessor McGonagall didn't even bother to tell him off She was actually shaking her finger in Malfoys direction, her hat had fallen off, and she too was shouting furiously. 
The tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist, beating its wings hopelessly against his fingers. 
Tangled together in a manyarmed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yelling hoarsely, back to earth. 
Harry and Ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend several classes at once, but they couldn't restrain themselves when they saw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself. 
"No," said Hermione shortly. 
Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower; History of Magic on Wednesday morning, in which Harry scribbled everything Florean Fortescue had ever told him about medieval witchhunts, while wishing he could have had one of Fortescue's choconut sundaes with him in the stifling classroom. 
Their second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was Defense Against the Dark Arts. 
Nearly finished?" "Yes," said Harry. 
Hermione and Ron, not being on speaking terms with the Minister of Magic, hovered awkwardly in the background. 
"Why'd you stop me?" said Ron angrily as they entered the Great Hall for lunch. 
But they all refused to say. 
"Yeah," said Harry, looking at his own watch. 
Itwas now two o'clock. 
"Er" said Harry, "a dark shape... um..." 
She looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure. 
HIS SERVANT HAS BEEN CHAINED THESE TWELVE YEARS. 
.. BEFORE MIDNIGHT... THE SERVANT... WILL SET OU... 
Professor Trelawney's head fell forward onto her chest. 
Over in the corner, however, sat Ron and Hermione. 
Hagrid shut the door quickly and Harry pulled off the cloak. 
"He's got no power ter overrule the Committee. 
"Yeh're ter go back up ter the castle. 
Scabbers looked dreadful. 
He was thinner than ever, large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches, and he writhed in Ron's hands as though desperate to free himself "It's okay, Scabbers!" said Ron. 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around. 
"They mustn' find yeh here.... Go now..." 
Harry felt strangely unreal, and even more so when he saw Buckbeak a few yards away, tethered to a tree behind Hagrid's Pumpkin patch. 
"We can't," said Ron, who was paperwhite. 
They set off back toward the castle, walking slowly to keep themselves hidden under the cloak. 
"Ron, be quiet!" Hermione whispered urgently. 
"Fudge'll be out here in a minute" "He won'tstayput" Scabbers was plainly terrified. 
But the cat was getting nearer"ScabbersNO!" 
"Dumbledore the Ministerthey'll be coming back out in a minute" But before they could cover themselves again, before they could even catch their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws.... 
Something was bounding toward them, quiet as a shadowan enormous, paleeyed, jetblack dog. 
He heard Hermione shriek with pain and fall too. 
Harry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his eyes "Lumos!"he whispered. 
That thing's big enough to eat him; we haven't got time" "Harrywe're never going to get through without help" Another branch whipped down at them, twigs clenched like knuckles. 
"If that dog can get in, we can," Harry panted, darting here and there, trying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches, but he couldn't get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of the tree's blows. 
Harry went next; he crawled forward, headfirst, and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel. 
Hermione suddenly grabbed Harry's arm again. 
Her wide eyes were traveling around the boarded windows. 
His eyes fell on a wooden chair near them. 
"Ghosts didn't do that," he said slowly. 
Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor, where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairs. 
"Not a dog," Ron moaned. 
"Harry, it's a trap" "What" "He's the dog... he's an Animagus." 
Harry wheeled around. 
A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. 
Harry's and Hermione's wands shot out of their hands, high in the air, and Black caught them. 
My mum... trying to stop Voldemort killing me... and you did that... you did it...." 
"Get off," he murmured, trying to push Crookshanks off him. 
The door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and Harry wheeled around as Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room, his face bloodless, his wand raised and ready. 
The Professor walked to Black's side, seized his hand, pulled him to his feet so that Crookshanks fell to the floor, and embraced Black like a brother. 
Lupin let go of Black and turned to her. 
"Hermione, calm down" "I didn't tell anyone!" 
"I can explain" Harry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh wave of fury. 
"I trusted you," he shouted at Lupin, his voice wavering, out of control, "and all the time you've been his friend!" 
"You're wrong," said Lupin. "I haven't been Sirius's friend, but I am nowLet me explain...." 
Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of pain. 
"He assigned that essay hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant.... 
Lupin forced a laugh. 
I was in my office examining it" "You know how to work it?" Harry said suspiciously. 
"You wrote?" 
"You might have been wearing your father's old cloak, Harry" "How do you know about the cloak?" 
"You're both mental." 
"Ridiculous!" said Hermione faintly. 
And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as Black's weight fell on his broken leg.."Sirius, NO!" 
Because the Marauder's map never lies... 
Azkaban must have unhinged Black after allbut why was Lupin playing along with him? 
Scabbers can't be Pettigrew... it just can't be true, you know it can't..." 
The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me." 
He looked sober and tired. 
As long as I take it in the week, preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform.... 
The truth is that it was planted because I came to Hogwarts. 
They could each turn into a different animal at will." 
Under their influence, I became less dangerous. 
"What sort of animal?" Harry began, but Hermione cut him off. 
"Snape?" said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers; for the first time in minutes and looking up at Lupin. 
"Professor Snape was at school with us. 
Hermione screamed. 
I saw you running along this passageway and out of sight." 
"Severus" Lupin began, but Snape overrode him. 
"You haven't heard everythingI can explainSirius is not here to kill Harry" "Two more for Azkaban tonight," said Snape, his eyes now gleaming fanatically. 
It would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred. 
Harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom to believe. 
"You, Potter, and Weasley are outofbounds, in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf. 
"I don't think we need to go that far. 
I have just saved your neck; you should be thanking me on bended knee! 
GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!" 
There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. 
Harry looked around. 
"My God," said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again. 
"He's got a toe missing," said Black. 
"Didn't you ever wonder why he was living so long?" 
"What do you mean?" breathed Hermione. 
"And why did he fake his death?" he said furiously. 
"No," said Lupin, "Harry" "And now you've come to finish him off!" 
He approached Lupin and the struggling rat, and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his face. 
He looked around at them all, his breathing fast and shallow. 
Black's wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around the wrist, gave him a warning took, then turned again to Pettigrew, his voice light and casual. 
"No one's going to try and kill you until we've sorted a few things out," said Lupin. 
I've been waiting for this for twelve years!" 
"What, scared to hear your old master's name?" said Black. 
It used to be us... me and Remus... and James.... 
Pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times. 
"Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter," said Lupin. 
I never meant it to happen.... 
"Hehe was taking over everywhere!" gasped Pettigrew. 
"What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed?" said Black, with a terrible fury in his face. 
Hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall. 
His own stinking skin meant more to him than your whole family." 
"But think... think what he did...." 
"But if you transform, Peter," growled Black, his own wand pointing at Pettigrew too, "we will kill you. 
As though invisible strings were tied to Snape's wrists, neck, and knees, he was pulled into a standing position, head still lolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet. 
Crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room, his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high. 
"You' re free," said Harry. 
Harry's mind was buzzing. 
His wand was still pointed sideways at Pettigrew's chest. 
Black froze. 
They formed a solid wall around Harry and Hermione, and were getting closer.... 
He was alone... completely alone.... 
His mother was screaming in his ears.... She was going to be the last thing he ever heardAnd then, through the fog that was drowning him, he thought he saw a silvery light growing brighter and brighter... He felt himself fall forward onto the grass.... Facedown, too weak to move, sick and shaking, Harry opened his eyes. 
He felt the last of his strength leave him, and his head hit the ground as he fainted. 
Shocking business... shocking... miracle none of them died... never heard the like... by thunder, it was lucky you were there, Snape...." 
"Nasty cut you've got there.... 
"And yetis it good for him to be given so much special treatment? 
Harry lay listening with his eyes tight shut. 
Moonlight was falling across her bed. 
She placed the chocolate on Harry's bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer. 
"He'll live, said Madam Pomfrey grimly. 
They've got Black. 
You can't let the dementors do that thing to Sirius, he's" But Fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his face. 
Black's done a very good job on them...." 
Potter is my patient, and he should not be distressed!" 
"Is this a hospital wing or not? 
"You surely don't believe a word of Black's story?" Snape whispered, his eyes fixed on Dumbledore's face. 
It closed behind them, and Dumbledore turned to Harry and Hermione. 
He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. 
"Now, pay attention," said Dumbledore, speaking very low, and very clearly. 
"Three turns? 
"Ready?" she said breathlessly. 
Hermione turned the hourglass over three times. 
He looked wildly around at Hermione, the chain of the hourglass cutting into his neck. 
"Yes," said Hermione, her ear still glued to the cupboard door. 
I've been using it all year to get to all my lessons. 
"Doesn't sound like anyone's there.... Come on, let's go." 
The shadows were already lengthening, the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest gilded once more with gold. 
They moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk and peered out from either side. 
"Now?" Harry whispered. 
We've got to wait until they've seen he's tied outside!" 
"Hermione," said Harry suddenly, "what if wewe just run in there and grab Pettigrew" "No!" said Hermione in a terrified whisper. 
There was a knock on Hagrid's front door. 
He, Ron, and Hermione had gone... but the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back door. 
Macnair, You're supposed to listen too, that's procedure" Macnair's face vanished from the window. 
It was now or never. 
"Wait here," Harry whispered to Hermione. 
Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up again. 
"Come on, Buckbeak," Harry murmured, "come on, we're going to help you. 
"Well, let's get this over with," said the reedy voice of the Committee member from inside Hagrid's cabin. 
Harry, Hermione, and Buckbeak stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently. 
Beaky, yeh clever boy!" 
"Come in, come in...." 
Harry watched himself and Hermione chasing after Ron. 
"That was Crookshanks pressing the knot," said Hermione. 
"If only Dumbledore had come with us..." 
Then"Here comes Lupin!" said Harry as they saw another figure sprinting down the stone steps and hating toward the Willow. 
He grabbed the cloak and held it up. 
I think" Harry swallowed, knowing how strange this was going to sound. 
Wormtail had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was dead.... Was it so impossible his father had done the same? 
The moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds. 
"He's transforming "Hermione!" said Harry suddenly. 
Lupin's going to run into the forest, right at us!" 
Where are we going to go? 
The dementors wilt be coming any moment" "Back to Hagrid's!" Harry said. 
Fang the boarhound barked loudly. 
"Shh, Fang, it's us!" said Hermione, hurrying over and scratching his ears to quieten him. 
That meant the dementors were closing in on Sirius.... He and Hermione would be running to him any moment.... 
If it was him... if it really was him... he had to know, had to find out.... 
Harry threw himself behind it, peering desperately through the leaves. 
Harry raised his head to look at the circle of dementors across the lake. 
It wasn't a horse. 
And Harry realized... 
But as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature, it vanished. 
Together they peered around the bush at the other bank. 
Snape had regained consciousness. 
He was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of Harry, Hermione, and Black onto them. 
"We've got about fortyfive minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing. 
11 They waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake, while the bush next to them whispered in the breeze. 
The man was hurrying across the grounds, toward one of the entrances. 
"He's there!" 
He reached out, and as Buckbeak's wings fell, was able to tap sharply on the glass. 
Buckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head. 
Harry!" 
Their footsteps died away. 
She checked her watch. 
A moment later, Madam Pomfrey came striding back out of her office. 
Indeed, he looked as though he was quite enjoying himself. 
A shadow fell across them and they looked 'tip to see a very blearyeyed Hagrid, mopping his sweaty face with one of his tableclothsized handkerchiefs and beaming down at them. 
"What?" they said, pretending to look curious. 
"Blimey, haven' yeh heard?" said Hagrid, his smile fading a little. 
"Why?" 
"Resigned firs' thing this mornin'. 
He had already packed most of his things. 
The grindylow's empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase, which was open and nearly full. 
It was the Marauder's Map. 
I think the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him hard. So heeraccidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning at breakfast." 
"Don't go!" 
"I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle." 
Harry stared up at Dumbledore. 
Dumbledore wouldn't laughhe could tell Dumbledore... 
Your father is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him. 
He was convinced that Hagrid had found a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety, and seemed outraged that he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper. 
But the thing that was lowering Harry's spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to the Dursleys. 
The exam results came out on the last day of term. 
Harry was amazed that he had got through Potions. 
Ron ignored her. 
Come and stay, and we'll go and see it! 
The owl dropped its letter onto Harry's seat and began zooming around their compartment, apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing its task. 
Buckbeak and I are in hiding. 
"Yes, but he hadn't jinxed it, had he?" said Ron. 
"Definitely an owl?" 
"That's good enough for me," said Ron happily. 
"You haven't got a godfather!" 
He's a convicted murderer, but he's broken out of wizard prison and he's on the run. 
The gun did actually go off first, but that was how it seemed to Levin. It appeared that Vassenka Veslovsky had pulled only one trigger, and had left the other hammer still cocked. 
And besides, Veslovsky was at first so naively distressed, and then laughed so goodhumoredly and infectiously at their general dismay, that one could not but laugh with him. 
Vassenka Veslovsky was the first to run after the dog. 
Levin said to himself, as he went back to the carriage that had sunk in the mire. 
As they drew near this more important marsh, the chief aim of their expedition, Levin could not help considering how he could get rid of Vassenka and be free in his movements. 
He pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the huge halfmown wet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the river. 
Stepan Arkadyevitch hit one at the very moment when it was beginning its zigzag movements, and the snipe fell in a heap into the mud. 
Oblonsky aimed deliberately at another, still flying low in the reeds, and together with the report of the shot, that snipe too fell, and it could be seen fluttering out where the sedge had been cut, its unhurt wing showing white beneath. 
They kept flying up from just under the dogs, from under the sportsmen's legs, and Levin might have retrieved his ill luck. 
You come too! the peasants shouted to Levin. Never fear! 
Though it was dusk, not one of them wanted to go to sleep. 
I don't understand you, said Levin, sitting up in the hay; how is it such people don't disgust you? 
Oblonsky, of course, goes out of bonhomie, but other people say: 'Well, Oblonsky stays with them. '... 
But of course you think the railways useless. 
It really is. 
Ah! our host; so you're not asleep yet? he said to the peasant who came into the barn, opening the creaking door. 
When I come back there'll be the note from Kitty. 
Yes, Stiva may be right, I'm not manly with her, I'm tied to her apronstrings.... 
Laska! here? he asked, pointing her to a different direction. 
Fetch it, fetch it! shouted Levin, giving Laska a shove from behind. 
She scented nothing now; she could only see and hear, without understanding anything. Ten paces from her former place a grouse rose with a guttural cry and the peculiar round sound of its wings. 
Crows were flying about the field, and a barelegged boy was driving the horses to an old man, who had got up from under his long coat and was combing his hair. 
One of the boys ran up to Levin. 
She found me perfectly well, and we have kept her till you are back. 
The princess began talking to him, but he did not hear her. 
This guilty air confirmed all his suspicions. 
The mechanician came when I was away; I haven't seen him yet, he said, not looking at her. 
Well, let's go in here! They were standing in the passage. 
Where does she get such wicked propensities? 
Stay, stay in the corner! she said to Masha, who, detecting a faint smile in her mother's face, had been turning round. 
He was undoubtedly a goodnatured fellow, and Levin felt sorry for him and ashamed of himself, as his host, when he saw the shy look on Vassenka's face. 
And who should be in the trap but Vassenka himself, with his Scotch cap, and his songs and his gaiters, and all, sitting in the hay. If only you'd ordered out the carriage! 
She was sorry to annoy her sister and to do anything Levin disliked. 
At that moment, when horses were wanted for the princess, who was going, and for the midwife, it was a difficult matter for Levin to make up the number, but the duties of hospitality would not let him allow Darya Alexandrovna to hire horses when staying in his house. 
On being asked whether she had any children, the handsome young woman had answered cheerfully: I had a girl baby, but God set me free; I buried her last Lent. 
Kitty, young and pretty as she is, even Kitty has lost her looks; and I when I'm with child become hideous, I know it. 
The birth, the agony, the hideous agonies, that last moment...then the nursing, the sleepless nights, the fearful pains.... 
All the faces turned to Darya Alexandrovna looked to her healthy and happy, making her envious of their enjoyment of life. 
And is it any better as it is? 
The coachman pulled up his four horses and looked round to the right, to a field of rye, where some peasants were sitting on a cart. 
A curlyheaded old man with a bit of bast tied round his hair, and his bent back dark with perspiration, came towards the carriage, quickening his steps, and took hold of the mudguard with his sunburnt hand. 
And who will you be belonging to?... 
As soon as you get out... he said, keeping hold all the while of the carriage. 
A healthylooking, broadshouldered young fellow came up too. 
Hi, friend! Stop! called the two voices. 
On reaching the carriage she jumped off without assistance, and holding up her riding habit, she ran up to greet Dolly. 
Something magical has happened to me, like a dream, when you're frightened, panicstricken, and all of a sudden you wake up and all the horrors are no more. 
I have lived through the misery, the dread, and now for a long while past, especially since we've been here, I've been so happy!... she said, with a timid smile of inquiry looking at Dolly. 
C'est une petitesse, if you like, but I love him all the more for it. 
Where are you going to put the princess? said Vronsky in French, addressing Anna, and without waiting for a reply, he once more greeted Darya Alexandrovna, and this time he kissed her hand. 
We had an Italian wetnurse. A good creature, but so stupid! 
She was delighted, too, at the baby's crawling. 
But the whole atmosphere of the nursery, and especially the English nurse, Darya Alexandrovna did not like at all. 
The dinner is you, and the talks I have before me with you, which I could never have with anyone else; and I don't know which subject to begin upon first. 
I must have everything out with you. 
You understand, with his property, now that we are settled in the country, Alexey can exercise great influence. 
Then there's Tushkevitchyou have seen him, you knowBetsy's admirer. 
Then the doctor, a young man, not quite a Nihilist perhaps, but you know, eats with his knife...but a very good doctor. 
He didn't tell you about his hospital? 
As is indeed not unfrequent with women of unimpeachable virtue, weary of the monotony of respectable existence, at a distance she not only excused illicit love, she positively envied it. 
We must send and tell them. 
Yes, this is a monument he is setting up here, said Anna, turning to Dolly with that sly smile of comprehension with which she had previously talked about the hospital. 
The ladies put up their parasols and turned into the side path. 
Then he showed them the wards one after another, the storeroom, the linen room, then the heating stove of a new pattern, then the trolleys, which would make no noise as they carried everything needed along the corridors, and many other things. Sviazhsky, as a connoisseur in the latest mechanical improvements, appreciated everything fully. 
Have I understood you rightly? he asked, looking round at her. 
She is happy in the present. 
But I can't help seeing them. 
She made no answer, but simply gazed at him. 
Dolly went to her room and she felt amused. 
Vronsky asked Sviazhsky to take in Anna Arkadyevna, and himself offered his arm to Dolly. 
I consider that for me the duty of being present at the session, of judging some peasants' quarrel about a horse, is as important as anything I can do. 
She thought how Levin, who believed the opposite, was just as positive in his opinions at his own table. 
Du train que cela va, the whole time will be wasted on it. 
And I'm afraid that with such a multiplicity of these bodies, they'll end in being a mere form. How many are you a member of, Nikolay Ivanitch? she turned to Sviazhskyover twenty, I fancy. 
Now they were by themselves, and Anna did not know what to talk about. 
Oh, no! But you know that sort of thing isn't forgiven. 
What do you think? 
But this is what I want you to tell me... 
How am I to say like that straight off? 
But you mustn't forget that you're seeing us in the summer, when you have come to us and we are not alone.... 
The races are just coming, his horses are running, he will go. 
He said that he was unhappy on your account and his own. 
Well, and the most legitimate desirehe wishes that your children should have a name. 
What children? Anna said, not looking at Dolly, and half closing her eyes. 
Dolly made no answer, she merely sighed. 
But that is just why a divorce is necessary. 
But Anna did not hear her. 
These were the very arguments Darya Alexandrovna had used in her own reflections; but she heard them without understanding them. 
Oh, we won't then, Darya Alexandrovna hastened to say, noticing the expression of suffering on Anna's face. 
I'm always bright and happy. 
But what can I do? 
In the first place, he won't give me a divorce. 
Anna was at that moment at the furthest end of the room, and she stopped there, doing something to the curtain at the window. 
They won't give him up to me. He will grow up despising me, with his father, whom I've abandoned. 
I her white dressing gown her figure seemed more than usually grand and broad. 
You can't with your pure heart understand all that I'm suffering. 
As she drove out into the open country, Darya Alexandrovna had a delightful sense of relief, and she felt tempted to ask the two men how they had liked being at Vronsky's, when suddenly the coachman, Philip, expressed himself unasked: Rolling in wealth they may be, but three pots of oats was all they gave us. 
But, to his surprise, Anna accepted the information with great composure, and merely asked when he would be back. 
She's trying to take that tone, and so much the better, he thought, or else it would be the same thing over and over again. 
The district marshals of nobility were all occupied with the elections, and it was impossible to get the simplest thing done that depended upon the court of wardship. 
But Levin had changed a good deal since his marriage; he was patient, and if he could not see why it was all arranged like this, he told himself that he could not judge without knowing all about it, and that most likely it must be so, and he tried not to fret. 
Levin, anxious to see into everything and not to miss anything, stood there too in the crowd, and heard the governor say: Please tell Marya Ivanovna my wife is very sorry she couldn't come to the Home. 
There was much discussion around the governor's table under the portrait of the Tsar. 
They were even, some of them, going to vote for him, and purposely to let him get a good many votes, so that the enemy might be thrown off the scent, and when a candidate of the other side was put up, they too might give him some votes. 
Votes, please! Beastly!... shouted furious and violent voices on all sides. 
Sergey Ivanovitch put his hand into the box, put the ball somewhere, and making room for Levin, stopped. 
Ninetyeight against! sang out the voice of the secretary, who could not pronounce the letter r. 
Beg pardon, excuse me, please, he said as to a stranger, but recognizing Levin, he smiled timidly. 
This expression in the marshal's face was particularly touching to Levin, because, only the day before, he had been at his house about his trustee business and had seen him in all his grandeur, a kindhearted, fatherly man. 
The big house with the old family furniture; the rather dirty, far from stylish, but respectful footmen, unmistakably old house serfs who had stuck to their master; the stout, goodnatured wife in a cap with lace and a Turkish shawl, petting her pretty grandchild, her daughter's daughter; the young son, a sixth form high school boy, coming home from school, and greeting his father, kissing his big hand; the genuine, cordial words and gestures of the old manall this had the day before roused an instinctive feeling of respect and sympathy in Levin. 
On learning this, the new party had made haste, during the dispute about Flerov, to send some of their men in a sledge to clothe the stripped gentleman, and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting. 
He's all right? he'll do. Not too drunk, he won't fall down? said Sviazhsky, shaking his head. 
Pawned them for drink, I expect. Damn the fellow, prince indeed! 
They're proprietors of a sort, but we're the landowners. 
Snetkov, now...We may be of use, or we may not, but we're the growth of a thousand years. 
But why is it we don't do like the merchants? Why don't we cut down our parks for timber? said Levin, returning to a thought that had struck him. 
And our work as noblemen isn't done here at the elections, but yonder, each in our corner. 
However bad the land is, he'll work it. 
Levin did not answer, and they walked together into the big room. 
But Levin had forgotten by now the calculations that had been explained to him, and was afraid Stepan Arkadyevitch might be mistaken in saying the right side. 
As he went up, he held the ball in his right hand, but thinking he was wrong, just at the box he changed to the left hand, and undoubtedly put the ball to the left. 
In one group Levin heard his brother's praises. One lady was telling a lawyer: How glad I am I heard Koznishev! 
There's not one of you in the law courts that speaks like that. 
Declined! a high boyish voice replied. Again it began, and again Declined. 
I let someone in, your excellency! 
Today he was celebrating the success of his jockey. 
On the left hand sat Nevyedovsky with his youthful, stubborn, and malignant face. 
And so every honest person, as he said, was on the side of today's success and was rejoicing over it. 
Darya Alexandrovna, getting the message, simply sighed over the rouble wasted on it, and understood that it was an afterdinner affair. 
Princess Varvara is no help, but a hindrance. 
But he had to go, and by the first train that night he set off home. 
But knowing that, he ought not to do it. What has he done, though?... 
However hard she tried, she could not love this little child, and to feign love was beyond her powers. 
She was sitting in the drawing room near a lamp, with a new volume of Taine, and as she read, listening to the sound of the wind outside, and every minute expecting the carriage to arrive. 
And forgetting everything, she ran joyfully to meet him. 
All was charming, but how many times it had charmed him! 
The evening was spent happily and gaily in the presence of Princess Varvara, who complained to him that Anna had been taking morphine in his absence. 
Don't you know that I can't live without you? 
Expecting every day an answer from Alexey Alexandrovitch, and after that the divorce, they now established themselves together like married people. 
In the town he seemed continually uneasy and on his guard, as though he were afraid someone would be rude to him, and still more to her. 
The old Princess Marya Borissovna, Kitty's godmother, who had always been very fond of her, had insisted on seeing her. 
Before her father, who purposely began talking in a loud voice to Vronsky, had finished, she was perfectly ready to look at Vronsky, to speak to him, if necessary, exactly as she spoke to Princess Marya Borissovna, and more than that, to do so in such a way that everything to the faintest intonation and smile would have been approved by her husband, whose unseen presence she seemed to feel about her at that instant. 
It's so wretched to feel that there's a man almost an enemy whom it's painful to meet, said Levin. 
Go, please, go then and call on the Bols, Kitty said to her husband, when he came in to see her at eleven o'clock before going out. 
But what are you going to do in the morning? 
Yes; wasn't it his article you were praising so? Well, and after that? said Kitty. 
That interested you so. I should certainly go. 
That cough she knew well. 
I have told Sokolov to sell the wheat, and to borrow an advance on the mill. 
I was positively forgetting her, he thought. And he remembered what was before them, so soon to come. 
I'll go and see him. By the way, if I do go to the concert, I'll go with Natalia. 
He drove off, thinking of Katavasov and the meeting with Metrov that was before him. 
He liked in Katavasov the clearness and simplicity of his conception of life. 
Levin thought that the clearness of Katavasov's conception of life was due to the poverty of his nature; Katavasov thought that the disconnectedness of Levin's ideas was due to his lack of intellectual discipline; but Levin enjoyed Katavasov's clearness, and Katavasov enjoyed the abundance of Levin's untrained ideas, and they liked to meet and to discuss. 
Levin, though he did not belong to the university, had several times already during his stay in Moscow heard and talked about this matter, and had his own opinion on the subject. 
He took part in the conversation that was continued in the street, as they all three walked to the buildings of the old university. 
The student, eyeing Levin with displeasure, said: Biography. 
Lvov was at home, and Levin went in to him unannounced. 
His handsome, delicate, and still youthfullooking face, to which his curly, glistening silvery hair gave a still more aristocratic air, lighted up with a smile when he saw Levin. 
They're such clever children. 
Lvov said, with his beautiful smile, touching her hand. 
But the more he listened to the fantasia of Ring Lear the further he felt from forming any definite opinion of it. 
Loud applause resounded on all sides. 
The comparison pleased him, but he could not remember whether he had not used the same phrase before, and to Pestsov, too, and as he said it he felt confused. 
In this room there were sitting in armchairs the two daughters of the countess, and a Moscow colonel, whom Levin knew. 
How is your wife? 
What a sudden death! said Levin. 
Were you at the opera yesterday? 
Lucca was very good. 
Go to that table, and make haste and take a seat, said the prince, and turning away he carefully took a plate of eel soup. 
Levin gladly went up to them. 
Turovtsin introduced them. Oblonsky's always late. 
Levin got up and went with him to the big table spread with spirits and appetizers of the most various kinds. 
They drank a wine glassful and returned to their table. 
You met him once at my place, don't you remember? 
He drank the glass offered him, and ordered a bottle of wine. 
Any shlupiks here yet?' 
They peeped into the infernal regions, where a good many men were crowding round one table, at which Yashvin was sitting. 
Just now it was due to both causes. 
Levin, don't go, he said, and he warmly squeezed his arm above the elbow, obviously not at all wishing to let him go. 
This is a true friend of minealmost my greatest friend, he said to Vronsky. 
Why, is he losing? 
Vronsky sat down at the table, surrounded by friends, who were incessantly coming up to him. 
The carriage drove up and both got in. 
How stupid these old ceremonies are, that no one believes in, and which only prevent people being comfortable! 
I believe you picture every woman simply as a female, une couveuse, said Stepan Arkadyevitch. 
If she's occupied, it must be with her children. 
It's not from philanthropy, it's from the heart. 
He positively forgot where he was, and not even hearing what was said, he could not take his eyes off the marvelous portrait. 
Levin flushed, and to cover his confusion would have asked whether she had seen Darya Alexandrovna lately; but at that moment Anna spoke. 
She was here yesterday. 
Never had anything clever said by Levin given him so much pleasure as this remark. 
Levin thought, forgetting himself and staring persistently at her lovely, mobile face, which at that moment was all at once completely transformed. 
Please order the tea in the drawing room, she said in English. 
She's a very gifted child and a sweet character. 
And her smile and her glanceall told him that it was to him only she was addressing her words, valuing his good opinion, and at the same time sure beforehand that they understood each other. 
She rose and took up a book bound in morocco. 
You shouldn't have. 
At home Kouzma told Levin that Katerina Alexandrovna was quite well, and that her sisters had not long been gone, and he handed him two letters. 
One was from Sokolov, his bailiff. 
You understand, I shall try not to see him, but I'm glad that this awkwardness is all over, he said, and remembering that by way of trying not to see him, he had immediately gone to call on Anna, he blushed. 
You were drinking at the club, drinking and gambling, and then you went...to her of all people! 
It was a long while before Levin could soothe his wife. 
They talked till three o'clock in the morning. 
Is Yashvin a child? 
But I need no proofs, I need love. 
And I can't write again. 
He ought to feel for me, she said, feeling tears of selfpity coming into her eyes. 
He was winningseventeen thousand. I got him away. 
What is it?...what is it? he said, halfasleep. 
Though he thought her stillness suspicious, as though she were holding her breath, and still more suspicious the expression of peculiar tenderness and excitement with which, as she came from behind the screen, she said nothing, he was so sleepy that he fell asleep at once. 
Kitty was walking about knitting rapidly and giving directions. 
I'm going for the doctor. 
Lord have mercy on us! pardon us! aid us! he repeated the words that for some reason came suddenly to his lips. 
And he, an unbeliever, repeated these words not with his lips only. 
For two hours, then? Not more? she inquired. 
The doctor was not even now getting up, and the footman, busy now in putting down the rugs, refused to wake him. 
Three minutes passed; it seemed to Levin that more than an hour had gone by. 
I'm certain I'm not wanted, still I've promised, and if you like, I'll come. 
I know, I know, the doctor said, smiling; I'm a married man myself; and at these moments we husbands are very much to be pitied. 
The doctor started upon his coffee. Both were silent. 
Such agony it was to him. 
All he knew and felt was that what was happening was what had happened nearly a year before in the hotel of the country town at the deathbed of his brother Nikolay. 
Lord, have mercy on us, and succor us! he repeated to himself incessantly, feeling, in spite of his long and, as it seemed, complete alienation from religion, that he turned to God just as trustfully and simply as he had in his childhood and first youth. 
One was away from her, with the doctor, who kept smoking one fat cigarette after another and extinguishing them on the edge of a full ash tray, with Dolly, and with the old prince, where there was talk about dinner, about politics, about Marya Petrovna's illness, and where Levin suddenly forgot for a minute what was happening, and felt as though he had waked up from sleep; the other was in her presence, at her pillow, where his heart seemed breaking and still did not break from sympathetic suffering, and he prayed to God without ceasing. 
He jumped up, would have liked to run away, but ran to her. 
Sometimes, when again and again she called upon him, he blamed her; but seeing her patient, smiling face, and hearing the words, I am worrying you, he threw the blame on God; but thinking of God, at once he fell to beseeching God to forgive him and have mercy. 
The shriek was so awful that Levin did not even jump up, but holding his breath, gazed in terrified inquiry at the doctor. 
Doctor! what is it? What is it? By God! he said, snatching at the doctor's hand as he came up. 
And meanwhile, there at the foot of the bed, in the deft hands of Lizaveta Petrovna, like a flickering light in a lamp, lay the life of a human creature, which had never existed before, and which would now with the same right, with the same importance to itself, live and create in its own image. 
He talked, and was all the time thinking of his wife, of her condition now, of his son, in whose existence he tried to school himself into believing. 
How is she? 
It was not at all the feeling he had looked forward to. He turned away while Lizaveta Petrovna put the baby to the unaccustomed breast. 
Stepan Arkadyevitch was familiar by now with the title of the post he coveted, and he brought it out rapidly without mistake. Alexey Alexandrovitch questioned him as to the duties of this new committee, and pondered. 
That is, in what way precisely? Karenin said softly. Yes, pity on her. 
Her position is intolerable for her, and of no benefit to anyone whatever. 
Stepan Arkadyevitch saw now that it was no good to dream of that, but still he was glad to see his nephew. Alexey Alexandrovitch reminded his brotherinlaw that they never spoke to the boy of his mother, and he begged him not to mention a single word about her. 
And though he had promised Alexey Alexandrovitch not to speak of Anna, he could not restrain himself. Do you remember your mother? he asked suddenly. No, I don't, Seryozha said quickly. 
Are you, though? Heavily? said Bartnyansky sympathetically. 
I came home to Russiahad to see my wife, and, what's more, go to my country place; and there, you'd hardly believe it, in a fortnight I'd got into a dressing gown and given up dressing for dinner. 
I became quite an old gentleman. There was nothing left for me but to think of my eternal salvation. I went off to ParisI was as right as could be at once. Stepan Arkadyevitch felt exactly the difference that Pyotr Oblonsky described. 
Then the wife of Yury Meledinskyyou know, the invalid?heard of this Landau, and had him to see her husband. 
Here there's been a general rush to him, and he's begun doctoring everyone. 
It would be quite as well, though, to get on friendly terms with her. 
There can be no difference where it is a question of holy truth. 
He understood at last that they were talking of religion. 
How anyone can be indifferent! said Lidia Ivanovna. 
Alexey Alexandrovitch and Lidia Ivanovna looked at each other. 
There is no sin for believers, their sin has been atoned for. 
Vous comprenez l'anglais? asked Lidia Ivanovna, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, she got up and began looking through a shelf of books. 
I want to read him 'Safe and Happy,' or 'Under the Wing,' she said, looking inquiringly at Karenin. 
No, I see I'd better not ask her about anything today, he thought. If only I can get out of this without putting my foot in it! 
But he was reassured at once by seeing that the words he's asleep referred not to him, but to Landau. 
Everything he could recall to his mind, everything was disgusting; but most disgusting of all, as if it were something shameful, was the memory of the evening he had spent at Countess Lidia Ivanovna's. 
And again, it was his fault that she was forever separated from her son. 
And he had actually flushed with vexation, and had said something unpleasant. 
I will make it up with him, and we'll go away to the country; there I shall be more at peace. 
He's truthful, he's honest, he loves me. 
Who was there? she said, after a pause. 
How? did she swim? asked Anna, frowning. 
His embarrassment confirmed her suspicion. 
Can't you go tomorrow? she said. 
If so, we won't go at all. But why so? 
What do you mean by that? she cried, looking with terror at the undisguised hatred in his whole face, and especially in his cruel, menacing eyes I mean to say... he was beginning, but he checked himself. 
What is it all about? 
Why didn't I die? and the words and the feeling of that time came back to her. 
As though absorbed in the arrangement of her rings, she did not even turn to him. 
Feeling that the reconciliation was complete, Anna set eagerly to to work in the morning preparing for their departure. 
There's nothing more awful than these chambres garnies. 
I wanted to go to Wilson's to take some dresses to her. 
Above all for your sake, he repeated, frowning as though in pain, because I am certain that the greater part of your irritability comes from the indefiniteness of the position. 
On that score you can set your mind quite at rest, she said, and turning away from him, she began drinking her coffee. 
She lifted her cup, with her little finger held apart, and put it to her lips. 
The day after tomorrow, I think, said Vronsky. 
That's why I'm not married, and never mean to be. 
I won't prevent you, he might say. 
No, anythingonly to live! Why, I love him! Why, he loves me! 
Tomorrow we're going away; I must see him and get ready for the journey, she said to herself. 
Oh, by the way, he said at the very moment she was in the doorway, we're going tomorrow for certain, aren't we? You, but not I, she said, turning round to him. 
Anna, we can't go on like this... 
You meant to go and see Darya Alexandrovna, said the girl, as though she understood. Darya Alexandrovna? 
Yes, I mustn't think, I must do something, drive somewhere, and most of all, get out of this house, she said, feeling with terror the strange turmoil going on in her own heart, and she made haste to go out and get into the carriage. 
Could I ever have believed then that I could come to such humiliation? 
How horrid that paint smells! 
Dolly will think I'm leaving my second husband, and so I certainly must be in the wrong. 
Katerina Alexandrovna Levin, answered the footman. 
Kitty, whom Vronsky was in love with! thought Anna, the girl he thinks of with love. 
Can I see the letter? 
I haven't, and indeed I don't wish it, said Anna. 
And what did I come here for? 
I'm worse here, more miserable. 
He came to see me, and I liked him exceedingly, she said, unmistakably with malicious intent. 
Kitty said naively, looking compassionately into her eyes. 
And, indeed, I did care to. 
There's someone who's pleased with himself, she thought, as she saw a fat, rubicund gentleman coming towards her. 
He took her for an acquaintance, and lifted his glossy hat above his bald, glossy head, and then perceived his mistake. 
We all want what is sweet and nice. If not sweetmeats, then a dirty ice. And Kitty's the sameif not Vronsky, then Levin. 
Anna said to herself, as soon as the carriage had started and swaying lightly, rumbled over the tiny cobbles of the paved road, and again one impression followed rapidly upon another. 
No, it's a useless journey you're making, she said, mentally addressing a party in a coach and four, evidently going for an excursion into the country. 
He is weary of me and is trying not to be dishonorable in his behavior to me. 
But... she opened her lips, and shifted her place in the carriage in the excitement, aroused by the thought that suddenly struck her. If I could be anything but a mistress, passionately caring for nothing but his caresses; but I can't and I don't care to be anything else. 
Hills it seems, and still houses, and houses .... 
And will Seryozha leave off asking and wondering about my two husbands? 
Yes, she said, handing him her purse, and taking a little red bag in her hand, she got out of the carriage. 
Katerina Andreevna, she's got them all, ma tante! cried the girl. 
No, I won't let you make me miserable, she thought menacingly, addressing not him, not herself, but the power that made her suffer, and she walked along the platform. 
A luggage train was coming in. 
She looked at the lower part of the carriages, at the screws and chains and the tall castiron wheel of the first carriage slowly moving up, and trying to measure the middle between the front and back wheels, and the very minute when that middle point would be opposite her. 
But she did not take her eyes from the wheels of the second carriage. 
The rest of his acquaintances, not interested in a book on a learned subject, did not talk of it at all. 
Sergey Ivanovitch knew the author of the article. 
Conversations in drawing rooms, in meetings, assemblies, and committeeseverywhere where talk was possibletook up part of his time. 
Katavasov had long been meaning to carry out his promise to stay with Levin, and so he was going with him. 
Sergey Ivanovitch asked for all the details the princess knew about the young man, and going into the firstclass waitingroom, wrote a note to the person on whom the granting of leave of absence depended, and handed it to the princess. 
While they were talking the crowd streamed by them into the dining room. 
Ah, princess! that was something like! said Stepan Arkadyevitch, suddenly appearing in the middle of the crowd and beaming upon them with a delighted smile. Capitally, warmly said, wasn't it? 
The princess looked at Koznishev without replying. 
Do talk to him a little on the way, said the princess. 
Everyone crowded to the doors. 
Here he is! said the princess, indicating Vronsky, who with his mother on his arm walked by, wearing a long overcoat and widebrimmed black hat. 
Oblonsky was walking beside him, talking eagerly of something. 
Vronsky was frowning and looking straight before him, as though he did not hear what Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying. 
At the next station Katavasov acted on this suggestion. At the first stop he moved into the secondclass and made the acquaintance of the volunteers. 
He was a quiet, modest fellow, unmistakably impressed by the knowledge of the officer and the heroic selfsacrifice of the merchant and saying nothing about himself. 
I wasn't long in the artillery; I'm a cadet retired, he said, and he began to explain how he had failed in his examination. 
All of this together made a disagreeable impression on Katavasov, and when the volunteers got out at a station for a drink, Katavasov would have liked to compare his unfavorable impression in conversation with someone. 
There was an old man in the carriage, wearing a military overcoat, who had been listening all the while to Katavasov's conversation with the volunteers. 
It's not for us to judge, countess, said Sergey Ivanovitch; but I can understand that it has been very hard for you. 
And what did her husband do? asked Sergey Ivanovitch. He has taken her daughter. 
He had thrown up everything, his career, me, and even then she had no mercy on him, but of set purpose she made his ruin complete. 
Do please talk to him a little. 
And as bad luck would have it, he has toothache too. 
But he'll be delighted to see you. 
His eyes still kept their look of angry suffering. 
My use as a man, said Vronsky, is that life's worth nothing to me. 
I'm afraid to touch you. 
And making arrangements to send for Levin and for the guests to wash, one in his room and the other in what had been Dolly's, and giving orders for their luncheon, Kitty ran out onto the balcony, enjoying the freedom, and rapidity of movement, of which she had been deprived during the months of her pregnancy. It's Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov, a professor, she said. 
They saw Stiva at the station; he was quite well. And I must run to Mitya. 
Then when I do like this, he simply beams on me, the darling! 
Well, well then we shall see, whispered Kitty. But now go away, he's going to sleep. 
If it's all written in those books, he can understand them. 
He says himself that he would like to believe. 
He was in the position of a man seeking food in toy shops and tool shops. 
Another fact of which he became convinced, after reading many scientific books, was that the men who shared his views had no other construction to put on them, and that they gave no explanation of the questions which he felt he could not live without answering, but simply ignored their existence and attempted to explain other questions of no possible interest to him, such as the evolution of organisms, the materialistic theory of consciousness, and so forth. 
Indeed, in these latter days he was far more decided and unhesitating in life than he had ever been. 
They'll bury her and this piebald horse, and very soon too, he thought, gazing at the heavily moving, panting horse that kept walking up the wheel that turned under him. 
Oh, well, of course, folks are different. 
How does he live for his soul? Levin almost shouted. 
No, I understood him, and exactly as he understands the words. 
A material miracle would have persuaded me. 
If goodness has causes, it is not goodness; if it has effects, a reward, it is not goodness either. 
I have only found out what I knew. 
And this meaning, in spite of its clearness, is mysterious and marvelous. 
And with the utmost stretch of imagination he could not conceive the brutal creature he would have been himself, if he had not known what he was living for. 
And it's all always the same. We've no need to think about that, it's all ready. 
Under every article of faith of the church could be put the faith in the service of truth instead of one's desires. 
We are going there, said Dolly. 
Just look, Darya Alexandrovna, we shall have a shower, he added, pointing with a sunshade at the white rain clouds that showed above the aspen treetops. 
No, I've not finished reading him, said Levin. 
He thought that he had already had time to lose his temper with Ivan, to show coolness to his brother, and to talk flippantly with Katavasov. 
But the same instant, going back to his mood, he felt with delight that something new and important had happened to him. 
That's the right thing for him, said Levin. Are volunteers still going out then? he added, glancing at Sergey Ivanovitch. 
I should think sol You should have seen what was going on at the station yesterday! said Katavasov, biting with a juicy sound into a cucumber. 
But who has declared war on the Turks?Ivan Ivanovitch Ragozov and Countess Lidia Ivanovna, assisted by Madame Stahl? 
But the prince is not speaking of help, said Levin, coming to the assistance of his fatherinlaw, but of war. 
On the other hand, both political science and common sense teach us that in matters of state, and especially in the matter of war, private citizens must forego their personal individual Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov had their replies ready, and both began speaking at the same time. 
And such a momentary impulse there is not, and there cannot be, in the case of the oppression of the Slavonic peoples. Possibly for you there is not; but for others there is, said Sergey Ivanovitch, frowning with displeasure. 
The people have heard of the sufferings of their brethren and have spoken. 
Here's Konstantin too. 
They didn't understand a word of it. 
Have you heard about the war, Mihalitch? he said, turning to him. 
Ought we to fight for the Christians? 
I don't need to ask, said Sergey Ivanovitch, we have seen and are seeing hundreds and hundreds of people who give up everything to sense a just cause, come from every part of Russia, and directly and clearly express their thought and aim. 
It is felt in the air, it is felt by the heart. 
Yes, all the newspapers do say the same thing, said the prince. 
And he's a truthful man too, but there's no refusing to believe in the utility of eight thousand roubles. 
Let everyone who advocates war be enrolled in a special regiment of advanceguards, for the front of every storm, of every attack, to lead them all!' 
No, by God, I haven't the faintest idea! said Katavasov with a loud roar of laughter. 
'I bring not peace, but a sword,' says Christ, Sergey Ivanovitch rejoined for his part, quoting as simply as though it were the easiest thing to understand the very passage that had always puzzled Levin most. 
Ah, my dear fellow, you're defeated, utterly defeated! cried Katavasov goodhumoredly. 
Gladly we promise complete submission. 
He wanted to say too that if public opinion were an infallible guide, then why were not revolutions and the commune as lawful as the movement in favor of the Slavonic peoples? 
And Levin ceased speaking and then called the attention of his guests to the fact that the storm clouds were gathering, and that they had better be going home before it rained. 
The men of the party, holding their hats on, strode with long steps beside her. 
They were just at the steps when a big drop fell splashing on the edge of the iron guttering. 
The peasant girls working in the garden ran shrieking into shelter in the servants' quarters. 
A few minutes after Kitty had left the room she sent for Levin to come to the nursery. 
He frowned and shook his head disapprovingly. 
The baby was taken out of the bath, drenched with water, wrapped in towels, dried, and after a piercing scream, handed to his mother. 
And most of all, at there being far more apprehension and pity than pleasure. 
Were you very much frightened? she said. 
This new feeling has not changed me, has not made me happy and enlightened all of a sudden, as I had dreamed, just like the feeling for my child. 
Could be mended or bettered with me for a teacher. And then, too, nor goods nor gold have I, 
And so to magic my soul I've given, 
Then, mournful friend! uprose thy smile!

Sound understanding and good sense

We're under more constraint than ever, 
And that last skiff, so heavily laden, 
In truth we've found you long ere this

However, if you provide access to or 
What sort of petting do you need? 
All this was quite familiar to the two young men, who were wont to come home every year during the dogdays, since they had no horses, and it was not customary to allow students to ride afield on horseback. 
It was only at the end of their course of study that Bulba had sent them a couple of young stallions from his stud. 
The guests congratulated Bulba and the young men, telling them they would do well and that there was no better knowledge for a young man than a knowledge of that same Zaporozhian Setch. [2] The village or, rather, permanent camp of the Zaporozhian Cossacks. 
"The old dog knows everything, but he always pretends the contrary." 
"Confess, my boys, they thrashed you well with fresh birchtwigs on your backs and all over your Cossack bodies; and perhaps, when you grew too sharp, they beat you with whips. 
"Let anybody just touch me, let any Tatar risk it now, and he'll soon learn what a Cossack's sword is like!" "Good, my son, by heavens, good! 
Their bold comrades had a right to reply to the Sultan when he asked how many they were, "Who knows? We are scattered all over the steppes; wherever there is a hillock, there is a Cossack." 
In short, the Russian character here received a profound development, and manifested a powerful outwards expression. [3] Cossack villages. In the Setch, a large wooden barrack. 
At first he had intended to send them forth alone; but at the sight of their freshness, stature, and manly personal beauty his martial spirit flamed up and he resolved to go with them himself the very next day, although there was no necessity for this except his obstinate selfwill. 
Don't prepare us a bed: we need no bed; we will sleep in the courtyard." 
In truth, she was to be pitied, as was every woman of that period. 
She saw her husband two or three days in a year, and then, for several years, heard nothing of him. 
She hovered around her children with anxiety, passion, tears, like the gull of the steppes. 
Whilst she, with tears, prepared what was needed for breakfast, Bulba gave his orders, went to the stable, and selected his best trappings for his children with his own hand. 
All sat down, not excepting the servants, who had been standing respectfully at the door. "Now, mother, bless your children," said Bulba. 
Farewell, childhood, games, all, all, farewell! 
He learned more willingly and without the effort with which strong and weighty characters generally have to make in order to apply themselves to study. 
She was laughing heartily, and her laugh enhanced her dazzling loveliness. 
The watchman awoke, and caught him firmly by the foot; and the servants, assembling, beat him in the street, until his swift legs rescued him. After that it became very dangerous to pass the house, for the Waiwode's domestics were numerous. 
The music which had resounded through the day had died away, and given place to another. 
The Cossacks arranged the horses' trappings. 
Some sturdy Zaporozhtzi lying, pipe in mouth, in the very road, glanced indifferently at them, but never moved from their places. 
[2] Enormous wooden sheds, each inhabited by a troop or kuren. 
The earth hummed dully all about, and afar the air resounded with national dance tunes beaten by the clanging heels of their boots. 
But one shouted more loudly than all the rest, and flew after the others in the dance. 
Taras soon found a number of familiar faces. 
"But what has become of Kasyan? 
This universal revelry had something fascinating about it. 
The only difference as regarded the students was that, instead of sitting under the pointer and listening to the wornout doctrines of a teacher, they practised racing with five thousand horses; instead of the field where they had played ball, they had the boundless borderlands, where at the sight of them the Tatar showed his keen face and the Turk frowned grimly from under his green turban. 
Long afterwards the fearful ceremony of this horrible execution haunted his mind, and the man who had been buried alive appeared to him with his terrible coffin. 
Or they went out upon the lakes, the river, and its tributaries allotted to each kuren, to throw their nets and draw out rich prey for the enjoyment of the whole kuren. 
He reflected incessantly how to stir up the Setch to some bold enterprise, wherein a man could revel as became a warrior. 
We can go to Turkey or Tatary." 
You are a sensible man, you were not chosen as Koschevoi without reason: so just tell me what we live for?" 
Why should I be made Koschevoi? 
A cry of approbation rang out from the crowd, and again the whole plain resounded afar with the Cossacks' shout. 
The last, and strongest, still uttered some incoherent speeches; finally even they, yielding to the power of intoxication, flung themselves down and all the Setch slept. 
Plainly, there is no justice in the world!" 
The other Cossacks listened at first, and then began themselves to say, "In truth, there is no justice in the world!" 
No one has even thought of making them a silver frame; they have only received what some Cossacks have left them in their wills; and these gifts were poor, since they had drunk up nearly all they had during their lifetime. 
He by no means wished to stir up all Zaporozhe; a breach of the truce appeared to him on this occasion unsuitable. "Permit me, gentles, to address you further." "Enough!" yelled the Cossacks; "you can say nothing better." 
And if I must tell you the truth, we have not boats enough, nor powder ready in sufficient quantity, for all to go. 
Far along the shore they built fires and heated tar in copper cauldrons to smear the boats. 
About this time a large ferryboat began to near the shore. 
They were Cossacks in torn, ragged gaberdines. 
"What is it?" inquired one of the kuren hetmans. "Eh! what! Evidently the Tatars have plastered up your ears so that you might hear nothing." "Tell us then; what has been going on there?" 
"Tell us what it is, you son of a dog!" shouted one of the crowd, apparently losing patience. "Things have come to such a pass that our holy churches are no longer ours." 
"And if the dog of a Jew does not make a sign with his unclean hand over the holy Easterbread, it cannot be consecrated." "He lies, brother gentles. 
Such words came from all quarters. The Zaporozhtzi were moved, and knew their power. 
These words uttered by some one in the throng flashed like lightning through all minds, and the crowd flung themselves upon the suburb with the intention of cutting the throats of all the Jews. 
These words were the signal. 
And you, brothers, do not surrender this Jew." 
He was no longer the timid executor of the restless wishes of a free people, but their untrammelled master. 
He was a despot, who know only to command. All the independent and pleasureloving warriors stood in an orderly line, with respectfully bowed heads, not venturing to raise their eyes, when the Koschevoi gave his orders. 
Some attended to the tyres of the wheels, others changed the axles of the waggons; some carried sacks of provisions to them or leaded them with arms; others again drove up the horses and oxen. 
'Tis so, by heavens! by heavens, 'tis so!" 
Occasionally, on the road, some were encountered who met their visitors with arms in their hands; but the majority fled before their arrival. 
Spies and scouts were sent ahead to study the time, place, and method of attack. 
It seemed as though Ostap were designed by nature for the game of war and the difficult science of command. 
His movements now began to be marked by the assurance which comes from experience, and in them could be detected the germ of the future leader. 
More than once their father marvelled too at Andrii, seeing him, stirred only by a flash of impulse, dash at something which a sensible man in cold blood never would have attempted, and, by the sheer force of his mad attack, accomplish such wonders as could not but amaze even men grown old in battle. 
In one place the flames spread quietly and grandly over the sky; in another, suddenly bursting into a whirlwind, they hissed and flew upwards to the very stars, and floating fragments died away in the most distant quarter of the heavens. 
Andrii went the rounds of the Cossack ranks. 
In answer to this, the apparition laid its finger upon its lips and seemed to entreat silence. 
"Sh!" cried the Tatar, clasping her hands with a supplicating glance, trembling all over, and turning her head round in order to see whether any one had been awakened by Andrii's loud exclamation. 
"And not one of the inhabitants has had a morsel of bread for a long while; all have long been eating earth." 
He looked into the cauldron of the other kurensnothing anywhere. Involuntarily the saying recurred to his mind, "The Zaporozhtzi are like children: if there is little they eat it, if there is much they leave nothing." 
He went straight to his father's waggon, but it was not there. 
"It will soon be light," said his guide: "we are approaching the spot where I placed a light." 
At the gate of one house sat an old woman, and it was impossible to say whether she was asleep or dead, or only unconscious; at all events, she no longer saw or heard anything, and sat immovable in one spot, her head drooping on her breast. 
Andrii wanted to go straight on to the large oaken door adorned with a coatofarms and a profusion of carved ornaments, but the Tatar pulled his sleeve and pointed to a small door in the side wall. 
At that moment the Tatar entered the room. She had cut up the bread which the warrior had brought into small pieces on a golden plate, which she placed before her mistress. 
With inexpressible delight Andrii watched her break it with her shining fingers and eat it; but all at once he recalled the man mad with hunger, who had expired before his eyes on swallowing a morsel of bread. 
Each simple word of this speech, uttered in a voice which penetrated straight to the depths of her heart, was clothed in power. 
She cast away the handkerchief, pushed aside the long hair which fell over her eyes, and poured out her heart in sad speech, in a quiet voice, like the breeze which, rising on a beautiful evening, blows through the thick growth of reeds beside the stream. 
Art not thou a cruel executioner, fate? 
"And what are my father, my comrades, my country to me?" said Andrii, with a quick movement of his head, and straightening up his figure like a poplar beside the river. 
That is my native land, and I bear that country in my heart. 
The Cossacks all stood with drooping heads, knowing that they were guilty; only Kukubenko, the hetman of the Nezamisky kuren, answered back. 
The people in the city are hungry; they will all eat heartily, and the horses will soon devour the hay. 
The Titarevsky and Timoschevsky kurens are to guard the baggage train on the right flank, the Scherbinovsky and Steblikivsky on the left, and to select from their ranks the most daring young men to face the foe. 
Before him stood the Jew, Yankel. 
"I will tell you at once," said Yankel. 
I ran to the very gate of the city, at the moment when the last of the army was passing through. 
Did you see any of our people?" 
I hardly recognised him. 
Bulba was petrified. "Why has he put on foreign garments?" "He put them on because they were finer. 
Bulba reflected deeply. 
Some awoke to find themselves bound in the enemy's hands; others never woke at all but passed in their sleep into the damp earth; and the hetman Khlib himself, minus his trousers and accoutrements, found himself in the camp of the Lyakhs. 
In the van came hussars in orderly ranks, behind them the horsemen in armour, and then the heroes in brazen helmets; after whom rode singly the highest nobility, each man accoutred as he pleased. 
Next came some more companies, and after these the cornet, then more files of men, and the stout colonel; and in the rear of the whole force the little colonel. 
Kobita, a good Cossack, though still very young, attacked one of the bravest men in the Polish army, and they fought long together. 
"There's a man I should like to measure strength with!" shouted Kukubenko, the hetman of the Nezamaikovsky kuren. Spurring his horse, he dashed straight at the Pole's back, shouting loudly, so that all who stood near shuddered at the unearthly yell. 
But Kukubenko had already left him, and was forcing his way, with his Nezamaikovsky kuren, towards another group. 
Greed led to no good: the head rolled off, and the body fell headless, sprinkling the earth with blood far and wide; whilst the Cossack soul ascended, indignant and surprised at having so soon quitted so stout a frame. 
The cornet had not succeeded in seizing the hetman's head by its scalplock, and fastening it to his saddle, before an avenger had arrived. 
"Have you bound us?" cried the Zaporozhtzi to them from below. 
"We will do so!" shouted the big colonel from above, showing them a rope. 
At length all dispersed. 
The sun had not ascended midway in the heavens when all the army assembled in a group. 
Whether they be few or many, it makes no difference; all are our comrades, and all are dear to us. 
So this is my speech: Let those to whom the prisoners captured by the Tatars are dear set out after the Tatars; and let those to whom the captives of the Poles are dear, and who do not care to desert a righteous cause, stay behind. 
Where the majority of a kuren goes there its officers are to go: if the minority of a kuren goes over, it must be added to another kuren." 
There were likewise many brave Cossacks among those who preferred to remain, including the kuren hetmans, Demitrovitch, Kukubenko, Vertikhvist, Balan, and Ostap Bulba. Besides these there were plenty of stout and distinguished warriors: Vovtuzenko, Tcherevitchenko, Stepan Guska, Okhrim Guska, Vikola Gonstiy, Zadorozhniy, Metelitza, Ivan Zakrutiguba, Mosiy Pisarenko, and still another Pisarenko, and many others. 
Every one of them had drunk and revelled away what would have sufficed any other for a whole lifetime, and had nothing to show for it. They spent it all, like Cossacks, in treating all the world, and in hiring music that every one might be merry. 
When they had all separated, and were ranged in two lines on opposite sides, the Koschevoi passed through the ranks, and said, "Well, brother gentles, are the two parties satisfied with each other?" 
"I treat you, brother gentles," thus spoke Bulba, "not in honour of your having made me hetman, however great such an honour may be, nor in honour of our parting from our comrades. 
"To the faith!" those more distant took up the cry; and all, both young and old, drank to the faith. 
"Now a last draught, comrades, to the glory of all Christians now living in the world!" And every Cossack drank a last draught to the glory of all Christians in the world. 
Meanwhile, the Koschevoi's words proved not unfounded, for a scarcity of provisions arose in the city. According to a custom of past centuries, the army did not separate as much as was necessary. 
When all was done which was necessary, he made a speech to the Cossacks, not for the purpose of encouraging and freshening up their spiritshe knew their souls were strong without thatbut simply because he wished to tell them all he had upon his heart. 
We made ourselves known to the Greeks, and we took gold from Constantinople, and our cities were luxurious, and we had, too, our temples, and our princesthe princes of the Russian people, our own princes, not Catholic unbelievers. 
Such was the time, comrades, when we joined hands in a brotherhood: that is what our fellowship consists in. 
It has happened to many of you to be in foreign lands. 
No! they are sensible people, but not the same; the same kind of people, and yet not the same! 
Men care only to have their ricks of grain and hay, and their droves of horses, and that their mead may be safe in their cellars; they adopt, the devil only knows what Mussulman customs. They speak scornfully with their tongues. 
Heavily roared the iron cannons with their wide throats; the earth hummed and trembled far and wide, and the smoke lay twice as heavy over the plain. 
But the Cossacks would not have succeeded in effecting both these movements if Ostap had not dashed into the middle of the foe and wrenched the linstocks from six cannoneers. But he could not wrench them from the other four, for the Lyakhs drove him back. 
He left those Cossacks there, and plunged with his own into another mass of the foe, making a lane through it. 
The foemen's ranks were visibly thinning, and the Lyakhs falling in sheaves. 
The poor prisoners endured and suffered all, but would not renounce their orthodox faith. 
But Guska did not escape his fate. 
Balaban, hetman of a kuren, soon after fell to the ground also from a waggon. 
Already was Kukubenko surrounded, and seven men only remained of all the Nezamaikovsky kuren, exhausted and with garments already stained with their blood. 
Before the enemies who surrounded him could be driven off, a spear was buried just below Kukubenko's heart. 
Kukubenko cast his eyes around, and said, "I thank God that it has been my lot to die before your eyes, comrades. 
The Cossack ranks were terribly thinned. Many brave men were missing, but the Cossacks still stood their ground. 
And the latter meanwhile, enveloped in the dust and heat of battle, eager to deserve the scarf which had been bound as a gift upon his arm, flew on like a greyhound; the handsomest, most agile, and youngest of all the band. 
Taras could not restrain himself, but shouted: "Your comrades! your comrades! you devil's brat, would you kill your own comrades?" 
Like the ear of corn cut down by the reapinghook, like the young lamb when it feels the deadly steel in its heart, he hung his head and rolled upon the grass without uttering a word. 
The murderer of his son stood still, and gazed long upon the lifeless body. 
But six suddenly sprang upon Ostap. They did it in an unpropitious hour: the head of one flew off, another turned to flee, a spear pierced the ribs of a third; a fourth, more bold, bent his head to escape the bullet, and the bullet striking his horse's breast, the maddened animal reared, fell back upon the earth, and crushed his rider under him. 
"Hey, Ostap, Ostap!" But something at that moment struck him like a heavy stone. 
"Yes," thought Tovkatch, "you might have slept forever." 
"Well, the Lyakhs must have surrounded and captured me. I had no chance of fighting my way clear from the throng." 
It is something for me to have ridden all night with you. 
Let the eagle tear out your eyes if it must be so; but let it be our eagle of the steppe and not a Polish eagle, not one which has flown hither from Polish soil. 
Not one was left of those who had stood up for the right, for faith and brotherhood. 
In vain did they try to cheer Taras and to divert his mind; in vain did the longbearded, greyhaired guitarplayers come by twos and threes to glorify his Cossack deeds. 
Two hundred boats were launched on the Dnieper, and Asia Minor saw those who manned them, with their shaven heads and long scalplocks, devote her thriving shores to fire and sword; she saw the turbans of her Mahometan inhabitants strewn, like her innumerable flowers, over the bloodsprinkled fields, and floating along her river banks; she saw many tarry Zaporozhian trousers, and strong hands with black huntingwhips. 
In the mosques they left heaps of dung. 
"I don't believe the man from whom my lord took these fine gold pieces remained in the world an hour longer; he went straight to the river and drowned himself, after the loss of such magnificent gold pieces." 
My lord thinks that I can take him just as he is, without concealing him?" "Well, hide me, hide me as you like: in an empty cask?" 
Rarely did a brick wall gleam red among them; for these too, in many places, had turned quite black. 
"Oh, impossible, dear lord, it is impossible!" said Yankel with a sigh. 
"Impossible," said another Jew. 
The Jews went out into the street. Taras locked the door, and looked out from the little window upon the dirty Jewish street. 
"Ah! Mardokhai, Mardokhai!" shouted the Jews in one voice. 
Two minutes later the Jews all entered the room together. 
Mardokhai departed, accompanied by his comrades, who were filled with admiration at his wisdom. 
The sentinels have consented, and one gaoler has promised. 
But may he have no happiness in the world, woe is me! 
He kept his pipe in his mouth, and puffed out smoke, which made the Jew sneeze in his sleep and pull his coverlet over his nose. 
The streets were still asleep. 
About a thousand men were sleeping here. 
They paid little heed to the new arrivals, and only turned their heads when Yankel said, "It is we, sirs; do you hear? it is we." "Go in!" said one of them, opening the door with one hand, and holding out the other to his comrade to receive his blows. 
And no one is to draw his sword, nor quarrel." 
The heyduke twirled the lower tier of his moustache, and his eyes beamed. 
"Ah, woe is me, what a fine race! Golden cords and trappings that shine like the sun; and the maidens, wherever they see warriorsAi, ai!" 
Since you have taken the money, you have no right to refuse." "Go, go to the devil! 
But this failure made a much deeper impression on Bulba, expressed by a devouring flame in his eyes. 
When he begins to break them on the wheel, and torture them in other ways, the criminals will still be alive; but when he cuts off their heads, then, my love, they will die at once. 
The upper stories of the houses were filled with people. 
The crowd of hungry gentles held up their caps to receive it; and some tall noble, whose head rose amid the throng, with his faded red jacket and discoloured gold braid, and who was the first to catch it with the aid of his long arms, would kiss his booty, press it to his heart, and finally put it in his mouth. 
He gazed at him from amid the crowd, and lost not a single movement of his. 
If only some of his relatives had been present at his death! 
To no one lower than the king himself would they have shown respect at such an hour; but their daring fell before the Church of Christ, and they honoured their priesthood. 
As the two pieces of this sword will never reunite and form one sword again, so we, comrades, shall nevermore behold each other in this world. 
The hetman and leaders were uneasy; all became thoughtful, and remained silent, as though oppressed by some heavy foreboding. 
Not in vain had Taras prophesied: all came to pass as he had foretold. 
A little later, after the treacherous attack at Kaneva, the hetman's head was mounted on a stake, together with those of many of his officers. 
He made three turns in the air with his steed, and fell heavily on the rocks. The sharp stones tore him in pieces; and his brains, mingled with blood, bespattered the shrubs growing on the uneven walls of the precipice. 
Already the people scent it far and near. A czar shall arise from Russian soil, and there shall not be a power in the world which shall not submit to him!" 
Now, philanthropists may easily imagine there is a skilful method of disarming and overcoming an enemy withoutgreat bloodshed, and that this is the proper tendency of the Art of War. 
Theory was beginning to drift in this direction until the facts of the last War taught it better. 
THE AIM IS TO DISARM THE ENEMY. 
If our opponent is to be made to comply with our will, we must place him in a situation which is more oppressive to him than the sacrifice which we demand; but the disadvantages of this position must naturally not be of a transitory nature, at least in appearance, otherwise the enemy, instead of yielding, will hold out, in the prospect of a change for the better. 
If, therefore, the enemy is to be reduced to submission by an act of War, he must either be positively disarmed or placed in such a position that he is threatened with it. 
Here, then, is another case of reciprocal action. 
But everything takes a different shape when we pass from abstractions to reality. 
The second point gives rise to the following considerations: 
If War ended in a single solution, or a number of simultaneous ones, then naturally all the preparations for the same would have a tendency to the extreme, for an omission could not in any way be repaired; the utmost, then, that the world of reality could furnish as a guide for us would be the preparations of the enemy, as far as they are known to us; all the rest would fall into the domain of the abstract. 
But if the result is made up from several successive acts, then naturally that which precedes with all its phases may be taken as a measure for that which will follow, and in this manner the world of reality again takes the place of the abstract, and thus modifies the effort towards the extreme. 
In point of fact, the country, with its superficial area and the population, besides being the source of all military force, constitutes in itself an integral part of the efficient quantities in War, providing either the theatre of war or exercising a considerable influence on the same. 
In this manner, the whole act of War is removed from the rigorous law of forces exerted to the utmost. 
There are circumstances in which the equivalent must be much greater than the political object, in order to secure the latter. 
Thus it is explained how, without any contradiction in itself, there may be Wars of all degrees of importance and energy, from a War of extermination down to the mere use of an army of observation. This, however, leads to a question of another kind which we have hereafter to develop and answer. 
After this conquest, his political object is accomplished, the necessity for action ceases, and for him a pause ensues. 
The principle of polarity is only valid when it can be conceived in one and the same thing, where the positive and its opposite the negative completely destroy each other. 
Now, being convinced that the superiority of the defensive (rightly understood) is very great, and much greater than may appear at first sight, we conceive that the greater number of those periods of inaction which occur in war are thus explained without involving any contradiction. 
But if we reflect how much more we are inclined and induced to estimate the power of our opponents too high than too low, because it lies in human nature to do so, we shall admit that our imperfect insight into facts in general must contribute very much to delay action in War, and to modify the application of the principles pending our conduct. 
We see from the foregoing how much the objective nature of War makes it a calculation of probabilities; now there is only one single element still wanting to make it a game, and that element it certainly is not without: it is chance. 
HOW THIS ACCORDS BEST WITH THE HUMAN MIND IN GENERAL. 
As there is room for this accidental on the one hand, so on the other there must be courage and selfreliance in proportion to the room available. 
No doubt in some cases these also might be excited to such a degree as to be with difficulty restrained and confined to the political road; but in most cases such a contradiction will not arise, because by the existence of such strenuous exertions a great plan in harmony therewith would be implied. 
We shall enter into this more fully in treating of the plan of a War. 
For the present we content ourselves with having brought the subject up to this point, and having thereby fixed the chief point of view from which War and its theory are to be studied. 
The passions which break forth in War must already have a latent existence in the peoples. The range which the display of courage and talents shall get in the realm of probabilities and of chance depends on the particular characteristics of the General and his Army, but the political objects belong to the Government alone. 
These three tendencies, which appear like so many different lawgivers, are deeply rooted in the nature of the subject, and at the same time variable in degree. 
The problem is, therefore, that theory shall keep itself poised in a manner between these three tendencies, as between three points of attraction. 
If we ask, first of all, for the object upon which the whole effort of War is to be directed, in order that it may suffice for the attainment of the political object, we shall find that it is just as variable as are the political object and the particular circumstances of the War. 
As War is no act of blind passion, but is dominated by the political object, therefore the value of that object determines the measure of the sacrifices by which it is to be purchased. 
Here, again, on account of the various significations of these means, so likewise it will be found that neither of them will be identical in its signification in all cases if the objects are different. 
Nothing is easier to conceive than two different directions in which our force may be employed, the first of which is to be preferred if our object is to defeat the enemy's Army, while the other is more advantageous if the defeat of the enemy is out of the question. 
However diversified this may be in form, however widely it may differ from a rough vent of hatred and animosity in a handtohand encounter, whatever number of things may introduce themselves which are not actual fighting, still it is always implied in the conception of War that all the effects manifested have their roots in the combat. 
In an Army the mass of combatants ranges itself always into an order of new units, which again form members of a higher order. 
Thus, the destruction of the enemy's armed force appears, therefore, always as the superior and more effectual means, to which all others must give way. 
It is, however, only when there is a supposed equality in all other conditions that we can ascribe to the destruction of the enemy's armed force the greater efficacy. 
Other methods are, therefore, less costly when they succeed, less dangerous when they fail; but in this is necessarily lodged the condition that they are only opposed to similar ones, that is, that the enemy acts on the same principle; for if the enemy should choose the way of a great decision by arms, OUR MEANS MUST ON THAT ACCOUNT BE CHANGED AGAINST OUR WILL, IN ORDER TO CORRESPOND WITH HIS. 
Here we shall content ourselves with saying that the awaiting must be no absolute endurance, and that in the action bound up with it the destruction of the enemy's armed force engaged in this conflict may be the aim just as well as anything else. 
Very many Generals have fallen into this error, and been ruined by it. 
What may be achieved by combinations of another kind in War we shall only learn in the sequel, and naturally only by degrees. 
Where these are of a high order, and manifest themselves by extraordinary achievements, the mind to which they belong is termed GENIUS. 
From this we may infer how great a share the intelligent powers have in superior military genius. 
Courage before danger to the person, again, is of two kinds. 
An average intellect may, at one time, perhaps hit upon this truth by accident; an extraordinary courage, at another, may compensate for the want of this tact; but in the majority of cases the average result will always bring to light the deficient understanding. 
We maintain that the mere union of a superior understanding and the necessary feelings are not sufficient to make up resolution. 
Whether this noble quality of a man is to be ascribed more to the peculiarity of his mind or to the equanimity of his feelings, depends on the nature of the case, although neither of the two can be entirely wanting. 
A telling repartee bespeaks rather a ready wit, a ready expedient on sudden danger implies more particularly a wellbalanced mind. 
If we take a general view of the four elements composing the atmosphere in which War moves, of DANGER, PHYSICAL EFFORT, UNCERTAINTY, and CHANCE, it is easy to conceive that a great force of mind and understanding is requisite to be able to make way with safety and success amongst such opposing elements, a force which, according to the different modifications arising out of circumstances, we find termed by military writers and annalists as ENERGY, FIRMNESS, STAUNCHNESS, STRENGTH OF MIND AND CHARACTER. 
In the first place, to make the conception clear, it is essential to observe that the weight, burden, resistance, or whatever it may be called, by which that force of the soul in the General is brought to light, is only in a very small measure the enemy's activity, the enemy's resistance, the enemy's action directly. 
Energy in action expresses the strength of the motive through which the action is excited, let the motive have its origin in a conviction of the understanding, or in an impulse. 
Of all the noble feelings which fill the human heart in the exciting tumult of battle, none, we must admit, are so powerful and constant as the soul's thirst for honour and renown, which the German language treats so unfairly and tends to depreciate by the unworthy associations in the words Ehrgeiz (greed of honour) and Ruhmsucht (hankering after glory). 
It is through these aspirations we have been speaking of in Commanders, from the highest to the lowest, this sort of energy, this spirit of emulation, these incentives, that the action of armies is chiefly animated and made successful. 
Plainly it is not vehement expressions of feeling, nor easily excited passions, for that would be contrary to all the usage of language, but the power of listening to reason in the midst of the most intense excitement, in the storm of the most violent passions. 
With our weak philosophy, we shall not proceed further in this mysterious field. 
Even the greatest impassibility of mind is hardly proof against them, because the impressions are powerful in their nature, and always act at the same time upon the feelings. 
Vanity is satisfied with mere show, but obstinacy rests upon the enjoyment of the thing. 
Everywhere intellect appears as an essential cooperative force; and thus we can understand how the work of War, although so plain and simple in its effects, can never be conducted with distinguished success by people without distinguished powers of the understanding. 
It is only now and again, in the memoirs of Generals or of those in their confidence, or by reason of some special historical inquiry directed to a particular circumstance, that a portion of the many threads composing the whole web is brought to light. 
To throw oneself, blinded by excitement for a moment, against cold death, uncertain whether we or another shall escape him, and all this close to the golden gate of victory, close to the rich fruit which ambition thirsts forcan this be difficult? 
To add to all this, compassion strikes the beating heart with pity at the sight of the maimed and fallen. 
This is, according to our view, a criterion of the influence which bodily fatigue exercises, and of the allowance to be made for it in matters of opinion. 
Great part of the information obtained in War is contradictory, a still greater part is false, and by far the greatest part is of a doubtful character. 
In a few words, most reports are false, and the timidity of men acts as a multiplier of lies and untruths. 
The impression of the senses is stronger than the force of the ideas resulting from methodical reflection, and this goes so far that no important undertaking was ever yet carried out without the Commander having to subdue new doubts in himself at the time of commencing the execution of his work. 
The battalion always remains composed of a number of men, of whom, if chance so wills, the most insignificant is able to occasion delay and even irregularity. 
If a contrary wind also springs up, that is, if any great accidental event declares itself adverse to him, then the most consummate skill, presence of mind, and energy are required, whilst to those who only look on from a distance all seems to proceed with the utmost ease. 
As we proceed, we shall often meet with this subject again, and it will hereafter become plain that besides experience and a strong will, there are still many other rare qualities of the mind required to make a man a consummate General. 
In their impedient effects they may therefore be comprehended again in the collective notion of a general friction. 
Habituation to War no General can give his Army at once, and the camps of manoeuvre (peace exercises) furnish but a weak substitute for it, weak in comparison with real experience in War, but not weak in relation to other Armies in which the training is limited to mere mechanical exercises of routine. 
This relates even to bodily fatigues. 
They should be practised less to accustom the body to them than the mind. 
Another less comprehensive but still very important means of gaining habituation to War in time of peace is to invite into the service officers of foreign armies who have had experience in War. 
However small the number of officers of this description may appear in proportion to the mass, still their influence is very sensibly felt. 
War in its literal meaning is fighting, for fighting alone is the efficient principle in the manifold activity which in a wide sense is called War. 
It is also in no way difficult to separate in idea the one activity from the other, if we look at the combatant forces fully armed and equipped as a given means, the profitable use of which requires nothing more than a knowledge of their general results. 
According to our classification, therefore, tactics IS THE THEORY OF THE USE OF MILITARY FORCES IN COMBAT. 
There may, therefore, certainly be acts of activity in War which, without any alteration in the point of view, may just as well be counted strategic as tactical; for example, very extended positions resembling a chain of posts, the preparations for the passage of a river at several points, &c. 
But if a column, instead of following the road through a valley, marches along the parallel ridge of heights, or for the convenience of marching divides itself into several columns, then these are tactical arrangements, for they relate to the manner in which we shall use the troops in the anticipated combat. 
To these belong all arrangements which concern only the accommodation of the troops, the construction of bridges, roads, &c. 
The occupation of camps and cantonments no doubt usually combines with the recuperation of the troops another object also, for example, the covering a district of country, the holding a position; but it can very well be only the first. 
Even entrenchments, the site and preparation of which are plainly part of the order of battle, therefore tactical subjects, do not belong to the theory of the conduct of War so far as respects the execution of their construction the knowledge and skill required for such work being, in point of fact, qualities inherent in the nature of an organised Army; the theory of the combat takes them for granted. 
The other branches of administrative activity which we have mentioned stand much farther apart from the use of the troops. 
The completing and replacing articles of arms and equipment, except so far as by the organism of the forces it constitutes a continuous activity inherent in themtakes place only periodically, and therefore seldom affects strategic plans. 
In certain cases these subjects may be really of decisive importance. The distance of hospitals and depo^ts of munitions may very easily be imagined as the sole cause of very important strategic decisions. 
We do not wish either to contest that point or to throw it into the shade. 
But the theory of War itself occupies itself with the use of these prepared means for the object of the war. 
The subsistence of the troops will only come into consideration like OTHER GIVEN CIRCUMSTANCES in respect of its results, not as an activity belonging to the combat. 
The Art of War thus viewed in its limited sense divides itself again into tactics and strategy. 
THE FIRST CONCEPTION OF THE "ART OF WAR" WAS MERELY THE PREPARATION OF THE ARMED FORCES. 
In the art of sieges we first perceive a certain degree of guidance of the combat, something of the action of the intellectual faculties upon the material forces placed under their control, but generally only so far that it very soon embodied itself again in new material forms, such as approaches, trenches, counterapproaches, batteries, &c., and every step which this action of the higher faculties took was marked by some such result; it was only the thread that was required on which to string these material inventions in order. 
LIMITATION TO MATERIAL OBJECTS. 
Architecture and painting know quite well what they are about as long as they have only to do with matter; there is no dispute about mechanical or optical construction. 
This makes its practice very difficult, and places the judgment of the physician above his science; but how much more difficult is the case if a moral effect is added, and how much higher must we place the physician of the mind? 
But to estimate exactly the influence of danger upon the principal actors in War, we must not limit its sphere to the physical danger of the moment. 
Certainly we may say that many a petty action of the passions is silenced in this serious business of life; but that holds good only in respect to those acting in a lower sphere, who, hurried on from one state of danger and exertion to another, lose sight of the rest of the things of life, BECOME UNUSED TO DECEIT, because it is of no avail with death, and so attain to that soldierly simplicity of character which has always been the best representative of the military profession. 
MEANS LEFT BY WHICH A THEORY IS POSSIBLE (THE DIFFICULTIES ARE NOT EVERYWHERE EQUALLY GREAT). 
The nearer theory attains the latter object, so much the more it passes over from the objective form of knowledge into the subjective one of skill in action; and so much the more, therefore, it will prove itself effective when circumstances allow of no other decision but that of personal talents; it will show its effects in that talent itself. 
It becomes then a guide to him who wishes to make himself acquainted with War from books; it lights up the whole road for him, facilitates his progress, educates his judgment, and shields him from error. 
THEORY THEREFORE CONSIDERS THE NATURE OF ENDS AND MEANSENDS AND MEANS IN TACTICS. 
The locality, which we prefer leaving for solution, under the head of "Country and Ground," might, strictly speaking, be without any influence at all if the combat took place on a completely level and uncultivated plain. 
The application of its means to this object is at the same time attended by circumstances which have an influence thereon more or less. 
Besides, this incompleteness in every case is more theoretical than real. 
On that account those who have considered it necessary or even beneficial to commence the education of a future General by instruction in all details have always been ridiculed as absurd pedants. It would be easy to show the injurious tendency of such a course, because the human mind is trained by the knowledge imparted to it and the direction given to its ideas. 
But it is never so in War. 
The reason is, that however plain and palpable the difference is between knowledge and power in the composite results of human knowledge, yet it is difficult to trace out their line of separation in man himself. 
So much for this, because we cannot do without these conceptions. But now we come forward with the assertion that War is neither an Art nor a Science in the real signification, and that it is just the setting out from that startingpoint of ideas which has led to a wrong direction being taken, which has caused War to be put on a par with other arts and sciences, and has led to a number of erroneous analogies. 
As the judgment must of itself suggest the cases in which the principle is not applicable, the latter therefore becomes in that way a real aid or guiding star for the person acting. 
If we see Frederick the Great's Generals always making their appearance in the socalled oblique order of battle, the Generals of the French Revolution always using turning movements with a long, extended line of battle, and Buonaparte's lieutenants rushing to the attack with the bloody energy of concentrated masses, then we recognise in the recurrence of the mode of proceeding evidently an adopted method, and see therefore that method of action can reach up to regions bordering on the highest. 
The evil is only that such a manner originating in a special case easily outlives itself, becausecontinues whilst circumstances imperceptibly change. 
The influence of theoretical principles upon real life is produced more through criticism than through doctrine, for as criticism is an application of abstract truth to real events, therefore it not only brings truth of this description nearer to life, but also accustoms the understanding more to such truths by the constant repetition of their application. 
In this CRITICAL three different operations of the mind may be observed. 
In these two last strictly critical parts of historical study, all depends on tracing things to their primary elements, that is to say, up to undoubted truths, and not, as is so often done, resting halfway, that is, on some arbitrary assumption or supposition. 
This leads, therefore, to a closer investigation of their nature, and thus a critical investigation may lead into what is the proper field of theory. 
It is more likely, on the contrary, that criticism would completely fail in its object if it degenerated into a mechanical application of theory. 
They exist to offer themselves for use as required, and it must always be left for judgment to decide whether they are suitable or not. 
Criticism must investigate the grounds of the deviation, and it is only in case these are insufficient that it has a right to appeal to principles laid down in theory. 
This office of criticism, of examining the effect produced by certain causes, and whether a means applied has answered its object, will be easy enough if cause and effect, means and end, are all near together. 
But if by this form he intended to make the result more certain, and that expectation was founded not on some exceptional circumstances (in this case), but on the general nature of the convergent form, as has happened a hundred times, then he mistook the nature of the means and committed an error. Here the work of military investigation and criticism is easy, and it will always be so when confined to the immediate effects and objects. 
The same multiplicity of circumstances is presented also in the examination of the means the higher our point of view, for the higher the object is situated, the greater must be the number of means employed to reach it. 
The ultimate object of the War is the object aimed at by all the Armies simultaneously, and it is therefore necessary that the consideration should embrace all that each has done or could have done. 
Through the decided superiority of numbers on the side of the French130,000 to 80,000there could be little doubt of the result; but then next arises the question, What use would the Directory make of a victory; whether they would follow up their success to the opposite frontiers of the Austrian monarchy, therefore to the complete breaking up or overthrow of that power, or whether they would be satisfied with the conquest of a considerable portion to serve as a security for peace? 
Supposing the result of these considerations to be that the French forces were much too weak for the complete subjugation of the Austrian monarchy, so that the attempt might completely reverse the respective positions of the contending Armies, and that even the conquest and occupation of a considerable district of country would place the French Army in strategic relations to which they were not equal, then that result must naturally influence the estimate of the position of the Army of Italy, and compel it to lower its expectations. 
Critical examination is not merely the appreciation of those means which have been actually employed, but also of all possible means, which therefore must be suggested in the first placethat is, must be discovered; and the use of any particular means is not fairly open to censure until a better is pointed out. 
Resistance to a relieving Army within lines of circumvallation had fallen into such disrepute and contempt that it appears to have entirely escaped consideration as a means. 
Buonaparte certainly was anything but deficient in boldness, and we may be sure that he did not see the whole case and its consequences as fully and clearly as we can at the present time. 
Naturally the critic, in treating of the means, must often appeal to military history, as experience is of more value in the Art of War than all philosophical truth. 
If criticism dispenses praise or censure, it should seek to place itself as nearly as possible at the same point of view as the person acting, that is to say, to collect all he knew and all the motives on which he acted, and, on the other hand, to leave out of the consideration all that the person acting could not or did not know, and above all, the result. But this is only an object to aim at, which can never be reached because the state of circumstances from which an event proceeded can never be placed before the eye of the critic exactly as it lay before the eye of the person acting. 
On the other hand, it is much more difficult to leave out of sight that which criticism knows in excess. 
If therefore it might wish in some cases to leave the result out of the consideration, it would be impossible to do so completely. 
We maintain that in this case, as in the case of the results, and for the same reason, it is impossible to disregard all these things completely. 
But there is another quite different effect of the result itself upon the judgment, that is if it is used quite alone as an example for or against the soundness of a measure. 
Whatever, therefore, of genius, skill, and energy the Conqueror of the World applied to the task, this last question addressed to fate remained always the same. 
Criticism, therefore, after having weighed all that comes within the sphere of human reason and conviction, will let the result speak for that part where the deep mysterious relations are not disclosed in any visible form, and will protect this silent sentence of a higher authority from the noise of crude opinions on the one hand, while on the other it prevents the gross abuse which might be made of this last tribunal. 
Thus it has come to pass that our theoretical and critical books, instead of being straightforward, intelligible dissertations, in which the author always knows at least what he says and the reader what he reads, are brimful of these technical terms, which form dark points of interference where author and reader part company. But frequently they are something worse, being nothing but hollow shells without any kernel. 
One fact merely touched upon in a very cursory manner may be used to support the most opposite views, and three or four such facts of the most heterogeneous description, brought together out of the most distant lands and remote times and heaped up, generally distract and bewilder the judgment and understanding without demonstrating anything; for when exposed to the light they turn out to be only trumpery rubbish, made use of to show off the author's learning. 
General Scharnhorst, whose handbook is the best ever written on actual War, pronounces historical examples to be of the first importance, and makes an admirable use of them himself. 
For the first of these purposes all that is generally required is a cursory notice of the case, as it is only used partially. 
The less effectually this is done the weaker will be the proof, and the more necessary it will be to supply the demonstrative proof which is wanting in the single case by a number of cases, because we have a right to suppose that the more minute details which we are unable to give neutralise each other in their effects in a certain number of cases. 
If any one will instance a dozen lost battles in which the side beaten attacked in separate converging columns, we can instance a dozen that have been gained in which the same order was adopted. 
All these opinions have been broached, and it is easy to see that they might very well arise, because each person takes a different view of the connection of events. 
When we are convinced of these difficulties in the use of historical examples, and at the same time of the necessity (of making use of such examples), then we shall also come to the conclusion that the latest military history is naturally the best field from which to draw them, inasmuch as it alone is sufficiently authentic and detailed. 
A general glance at the time of the Condottieri teaches us how the whole method of conducting War is dependent on the instrument used; for at no period have the forces used in War had so much the characteristics of a special instrument, and been a class so totally distinct from the rest of the national community. 
It is the exact fulfilment of silent suppositions, it is the noiseless harmony of the whole action which we should admire, and which only makes itself known in the total result. inquirer who, tracing back from the final result, does not perceive the signs of that harmony is one who is apt to seek for genius where it is not, and where it cannot be found. 
Still, even in respect to them, it is only in the highest branches of Strategy that moral complications and a great diversity of quantities and relations are to be looked for, only at that point where Strategy borders on political science, or rather where the two become one, and there, as we have before observed, they have more influence on the "how much" and "how little" is to be done than on the form of execution. 
In Strategy, where all goes on at a slower rate, there is more room allowed for our own apprehensions and those of others, for objections and remonstrances, consequently also for unseasonable regrets; and as we do not see things in Strategy as we do at least half of them in tactics, with the living eye, but everything must be conjectured and assumed, the convictions produced are less powerful. 
Long afterwards authors, who were eyewitnesses, have spoken of the danger, indeed of the imprudence, of the King's camps, and doubtless, at the time he pitched them, the danger appeared three times as great as afterwards. 
Must not the murmurs and doubts which these cause reach his ear? 
POSSIBLE COMBATS ARE ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR RESULTS TO BE LOOKED UPON AS REAL ONES. 
Therefore all these things must only be regarded as intermediate links, steps, as it were, leading up to the effectual principle, but never as that principle itself. 
The causes which condition the use of the combat in Strategy may be easily divided into elements of different kinds, such as the moral, physical, mathematical, geographical and statistical elements. 
But to treat upon Strategy according to these elements would be the most unfortunate idea that could be conceived, for these elements are generally manifold, and intimately connected with each other in every single operation of War. 
We must return again to this subject, which is touched upon in the third chapter of the second book, because the moral forces are amongst the most important subjects in War. 
Unfortunately they will escape from all bookanalysis, for they will neither be brought into numbers nor into classes, and require to be both seen and felt. 
Although little or nothing can be said about these things in books, still they belong to the theory of the Art of War, as much as everything else which constitutes War. 
In every rule relating to the physical forces, theory must present to the mind at the same time the share which the moral powers will have in it, if it would not be led to categorical propositions, at one time too timid and contracted, at another too dogmatical and wide. 
This is distinguished from mere bravery, and still more from enthusiasm for the business of War. 
A General is chosen by the reputation of his superior talents, the chief leaders of large masses after careful probation; but this probation diminishes as we descend the scale of rank, and in just the same measure we may reckon less and less upon individual talents; but what is wanting in this respect military virtue should supply. 
Standing Armies opposed to standing Armies, can more easily dispense with it, than a standing Army opposed to a national insurrection, for in that case, the troops are more scattered, and the divisions left more to themselves. 
We must purposely shut our eyes against all historical proof, if we do not admit, that the astonishing successes of these Generals and their greatness in situations of extreme difficulty, were only possible with Armies possessing this virtue. 
It must be led with double caution, until by degrees, in victory and hardships, the strength grows into the full armour. 
Beware then of confusing the SPIRIT of an Army with its temper. 
The place and part which boldness takes in the dynamic system of powers, where it stands opposed to Foresight and prudence, has been stated in the chapter on the certainty of the result in order thereby to show, that theory has no right to restrict it by virtue of its legislative power. 
If the one excites the imagination more because it is bolder, the other pleases the understanding most, because it has in it more absolute necessity. 
Now in our days there is hardly any other means of educating the spirit of a people in this respect, except by War, and that too under bold Generals. 
By it alone can that effeminacy of feeling be counteracted, that propensity to seek for the enjoyment of comfort, which cause degeneracy in a people rising in prosperity and immersed in an extremely busy commerce. 
If we go through the military history of modern Europe, we find no example of a Marathon. 
Tempelhof in his history of the Seven Years' War is the earliest writer who gives it regularly, but at the same time he does it only very superficially. 
There remains nothing, therefore, where an absolute superiority is not attainable, but to produce a relative one at the decisive point, by making skilful use of what we have. 
The right appreciation of their opponents (Daun, Schwartzenberg), the audacity to leave for a short space of time a small force only before them, energy in forced marches, boldness in sudden attacks, the intensified activity which great souls acquire in the moment of danger, these are the grounds of such victories; and what have these to do with the ability to make an exact calculation of two such simple things as time and space? 
The first when he left Dresden so suddenly in July 1760, and falling upon Lascy, then turned against Dresden, gained nothing by the whole of that intermezzo, but rather placed his affairs in a condition notably worse, as the fortress Glatz fell in the meantime. 
In 1813, Buonaparte turned suddenly from Dresden twice against Bluecher, to say nothing of his incursion into Bohemia from Upper Lusatia, and both times without in the least attaining his object. 
Frederick the Great gained this fine victory through altering during the night a position which he had just before taken up. 
Now there still remains an observation which concerns the essence of the thing. 
A surprise can only be effected by that party which gives the law to the other; and he who is in the right gives the law. 
Mutual surprises by the offensive and defensive may therefore meet, and then that one will have the advantage who has hit the nail on the head the best. 
If we leave to tactics the actual delivery of the blow, the battle itself, and look upon Strategy as the art of using this means with skill, then besides the forces of the character, such as burning ambition which always presses like a spring, a strong will which hardly bends &c. &c., there seems no subjective quality so suited to guide and inspire strategic activity as stratagem. 
The explanation of this is obvious, and it is almost identical with the subject matter of the preceding chapter. 
In a word, the pieces on the strategical chessboard want that mobility which is the element of stratagem and subtility. 
It seems incredible, and yet it has happened a hundred times, that troops have been divided and separated merely through a mysterious feeling of conventional manner, without any clear perception of the reason. 
If the concentration of the whole force is acknowledged as the norm, and every division and separation as an exception which must be justified, then not only will that folly be completely avoided, but also many an erroneous ground for separating troops will be barred admission. 
But when this disordering effect of victory stops, and therefore only the moral superiority remains which every victory gives, then it is no longer possible for fresh troops to restore the combat, they would only be carried along in the general movement; a beaten Army cannot be brought back to victory a day after by means of a strong reserve. 
The tactical results, the results within the four corners of the battle, and before its close, lie for the most part within the limits of that period of disorder and weakness. But the strategic result, that is to say, the result of the total combat, of the victories realised, let them be small or great, lies completely (beyond) outside of that period. 
But it is not so in Strategy. 
How greatly such corps which thus constitute our excess may contribute to the total success is evident in itself; indeed, it is not difficult to see how they may even diminish considerably the loss of the forces engaged in tactical, conflict on our side. 
But we must vindicate this proposition upon another ground. 
If Buonaparte, in his invasion of Russia in 1812, concentrated his Army in great masses upon one single road in a manner never heard of before, and thus caused privations equally unparalleled, we must ascribe it to his maxim THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE TOO STRONG AT THE DECISIVE POINT. 
In a partial combat, the force required to obtain a great result can be approximately estimated without much difficulty, and, consequently, we can form an idea of what is superfluous. 
We say on "its own account," for the influence which time, on account of other circumstances which it brings about but which are different from itself can have, indeed must necessarily have, for one of the two parties, is quite another thing, is anything but indifferent or unimportant, and will be the subject of consideration hereafter. 
The direction in which the enemy leads his columns to the combat can be perceived by actual sight only; where he intends to pass a river is learnt from a few preparations which are made shortly before; the line by which he proposes to invade our country is usually announced by all the newspapers before a pistol shot has been fired. 
The lost battle of a corps may be repaired by the victory of the Army. Even the lost battle of an Army may not only be counterbalanced by the gain of a more important one, but converted into a fortunate event (the two days of Kulm, August 29 and 30, 1813). 
If, therefore, tactics has in its reserves the means of not only meeting unforeseen dispositions on the part of the enemy, but also of repairing that which never can be foreseen, the result of the combat, should that be unfortunate; Strategy on the other hand must, at least as far as relates to the capital result, renounce the use of these means. 
Whoever has forces where the enemy does not give them sufficient employment, whoever has part of his forces on the marchthat is, allows them to lie deadwhile the enemy's are fighting, he is a bad manager of his forces. 
We hold it to be one of the principal uses of a complete theory openly to expose such vagaries, and as the geometrical element is the fundamental idea from which theory usually proceeds, therefore we have expressly brought out this point in strong relief. 
This must almost raise a doubt as to the correctness of our conception. But if military history leads to this conclusion when viewed in the mass the latest series of campaigns redeems our position. 
The more War becomes in this manner devitalised so much the more its theory becomes destitute of the necessary firm pivots and buttresses for its reasoning; the necessary is constantly diminishing, the accidental constantly increasing. 
Every deficiency in energy and exertion is then a weight in the scales in favour of the enemy; it is not so easy then to change from the fencing posture into that of an athlete, and a slight blow is often sufficient to knock down the whole. 
That a War which is waged with the whole weight of the national power on each side must be organised differently in principle to those where everything is calculated according to the relations of standing Armies to each other, it is easy to perceive. 
We have seen in the sixteenth chapter of this book, how, in most campaigns, much more time used to be spent in standing still and inaction than in activity. 
As soon as ever one of the two parties proposes to himself a new positive object, and commences active steps towards it, even if it is only by preparations, and as soon as the adversary opposes this, there is a tension of powers; this lasts until the decision takes placethat is, until one party either gives up his object or the other has conceded it to him. 
That a Commander should thoroughly understand these states, that he should have the tact to act in the spirit of them, we hold to be a great requisite, and we have had experience in the campaign of 1806 how far it is sometimes wanting. 
In that tremendous tension, when everything pressed on towards a supreme decision, and that alone with all its consequences should have occupied the whole soul of the Commander, measures were proposed and even partly carried out (such as the reconnaissance towards Franconia), which at the most might have given a kind of gentle play of oscillation within a state of equilibrium. Over these blundering schemes and views, absorbing the activity of the Army, the really necessary means, which could alone save, were lost sight of. 
G. M. I pray you, worthy hero, explain to me their whole system of government; for I am anxious to hear it. 
On the outside are marked all the seas, rivers, lakes, and streams which are on the face of the earth; as are also the wines and the oils and the different liquids, with the sources from which the last are extracted, their qualities and strength. 
Further, their resemblances to celestial and terrestrial things, produced both by nature and art, are so given that I was astonished when I saw a fish which was like a bishop, one like a chain, another like a garment, a fourth like a nail, a fifth like a star, and others like images of those things existing among us, the relation in each case being completely manifest. 
G. M. Tell me, please, of the magistrates, their services and duties, of the education and mode of living, whether the government is a monarchy, a republic, or an aristocracy. 
They are elected to duties of that kind, each one to that duty for excellence in which he is known from boyhood to be most suitable. 
And these teachers know well who is most suited for rule. 
For such knowledge as this of yours much servile labor and memory work are required, so that a man is rendered unskilful, since he has contemplated nothing but the words of books and has given his mind with useless result to the consideration of the dead signs of things. Hence he knows not in what way God rules the universe, nor the ways and customs of nature and the nations. 
For that they go out to the plain for the sake of running about and hurling arrows and lances, and of firing harquebuses, and for the sake of hunting the wild animals and getting a knowledge of plants and stones, and agriculture and pasturage; sometimes the band of boys does one thing, sometimes another. 
There are occupations, mechanical and theoretical, common to both men and women, with this difference, that the occupations which require more hard work, and walking a long distance, are practised by men, such as ploughing, sowing, gathering the fruits, working at the threshingfloor, and perchance at the vintage. 
If a woman is fit to paint, she is not prevented from doing so; nevertheless, music is given over to the women alone, because they please the more, and of a truth to boys also. 
For six days they ordain to sing with music at table. 
Only a few, however, sing; or there is one voice accompanying the lute and one for each other instrument. 
The borders of the fastenings are furnished with globular buttons, extended round and caught up here and there by chains. 
The keepers of clothes for the different rings are wont to distribute them, and it is marvellous that they have at the same time as many garments as there is need for, some heavy and some slight, according to the weather. 
When the women are exercised they get a clear complexion, and become strong of limb, tall and agile, and with them beauty consists in tallness and strength. 
Further, they assert that among us abuses of this kind arise from the leisure and sloth of women. By these means they lose their color and have pale complexions, and become feeble and small. 
For this reason they are without proper complexions, use high sandals, and become beautiful not from strength, but from slothful tenderness. 
But if the race is endangered, by no means is further union between them permitted. Moreover, the love born of eager desire is not known among them; only that born of friendship. 
And they defend themselves by the opinion of Socrates, of Cato, of Plato, and of St. Clement; but, as you say, they misunderstand the opinions of these thinkers. 
The women also are taught these arts under their own magistrates and mistresses, so that they may be able if need be to render assistance to the males in battles near the city. They are taught to watch the fortifications lest at some time a hasty attack should suddenly be made. 
During the second month the army is reviewed, and every day there is practice of arms, either in the cavalry plain or within the walls. 
G. M. With whom do they wage war, and for what reasons, since they are so prosperous? 
Immediately after, a priest, whom they call Forensic, is sent away. He demands from the enemy the restitution of the plunder, asks that the allies should be freed from oppression, or that the tyrant should be deposed. 
And in this manner is war undertaken against the insolent enemies of natural rights and of religion. 
Before this, however, the occasion of war and the justice of making an expedition are declared by a herald in the great Council. All from twenty years and upward are admitted to this Council, and thus the necessaries are agreed upon. 
All kinds of weapons stand in the armories, and these they use often in sham fights. 
Every horsesoldier carries a spear and two strongly tempered pistols, narrow at the mouth, hanging from his saddle. 
But this exemption from work is by no means pleasing to them, since they know not what it is to be at leisure, and so they help their companions. 
On the other hand, they who have been conquered through their own fault, or have lost the victory, are blamed; and they who were the first to take to flight are in no way worthy to escape death, unless when the whole army asks their lives, and each one takes upon himself a part of their punishment. 
They are unwilling that the State should be corrupted by the vicious customs of slaves and foreigners. 
Wherefore they do not as it were paint the earth, but dig it up well and use secret remedies, so that fruit is borne quickly and multiplies, and is not destroyed. 
And other vessels they have which are moved by the winds. They have a correct knowledge of the stars, and of the ebb and flow of the tide. 
And therefore in the summer they feed on fruits, because they are moist and juicy and cool, and counteract the heat and dryness. 
Fevers recurring every fifth, sixth, eighth or more days, you never find whenever heavy humors are wanting. 
They do not drink icecold drinks nor artificial hot drinks, as the Chinese do; for they are not without aid against the humors of the body, on account of the help they get from the natural heat of the water; but they strengthen it with crushed garlic, with vinegar, with wild thyme, with mint, and with basil, in the summer or in time of special heaviness. 
The masters of all the bands, who are captains of tens, of fifties, of hundreds, also assemble, the women first and then the men. 
They do not torture those named by the accused person, but they warn them. 
Or if he is accused a second or third time, his increased punishment rests on the testimony of three or two witnesses. 
And on single columns can be seen the essences of things described in the very terse style of Metaphysicviz., the essences of God, of the angels, of the world, of the stars, of man, of fate, of virtue, all done with great wisdom. 
G. M. Now you ought to tell me about their priests, their sacrifices, their religion, and their belief. 
Then Hoh orders the ropes to be drawn and the sacrifice is pulled up above to the centre of the small dome, and there it dedicates itself with the most fervent supplications. 
They write very learned treatises and search into the sciences. 
Then they sing the deeds of the Christian, Jewish, and Gentile heroes, and of those of all other nations, and this is very delightful to them. 
Further, they wear a slight covering, and above this a round hat a little larger than the size of their head. 
The poets sing the praises of the most renowned leaders and the victories. 
They believe that the true oracle of Jesus Christ is by the signs in the sun, in the moon, and in the stars, which signs do not thus appear to many of us foolish ones. 
They say that it is very doubtful whether the world was made from nothing, or from the ruins of other worlds, or from chaos, but they certainly think that it was made, and did not exist from eternity. 
The sun and the stars they, so to speak, regard as the living representatives and signs of God, as the temples and holy living altars, and they honor but do not worship them. 
They contemplate and know God under the image of the Sun, and they call it the sign of God, His face and living image, by means of which light, heat, life, and the making of all things good and bad proceed. 
The sea is the sweat of earth, or the fluid of earth combusted, and fused within its bowels, but is the bond of union between air and earth, as the blood is of the spirit and flesh of animals. 
Therefore we are bound to no father but God, and receive all things from Him. 
"Nancy,"Miss Polly's voice was very stern now"when I'm talking to you, I wish you to stop your work and listen to what I have to say." Nancy flushed miserably. 
Sweep the room and clean it, of course, after you clear out the trunks and boxes." "Yes, ma'am. And where shall I put the things, please, that I take out?" 
"In the front attic." Miss Polly hesitated, then went on: "I suppose I may as well tell you now, Nancy. 
"Nice? Well, that isn't exactly the word I should use," rejoined Miss Polly, stiffly. 
"However, I intend to make the best of it, of course. 
There had been a man of wealth who had wanted herand the family had much preferred him to the minister; but Jennie had not. 
She was forty now, and quite alone in the world. 
For years, now, she had been sole mistress of the house and of the thousands left her by her father. 
For some time she worked in silence; then, her task finished, she looked about the bare little room in plain disgust. 
"Well, it's donemy part, anyhow," she sighed. 
Then, doggedly: "Well, I don't care. 
I hope she did hear the bang,I do, I do!" In the garden that afternoon, Nancy found a few minutes in which to interview Old Tom, who had pulled the weeds and shovelled the paths about the place for uncounted years. 
"Mr. Tom," began Nancy, throwing a quick glance over her shoulder to make sure she was unobserved; "did you know a little girl was comin' here ter live with Miss Polly?" "Awhat?" demanded the old man, straightening his bent back with difficulty. 
"It's her niece; and she's eleven years old." The man's jaw fell. 
"Sho!I wonder, now," he muttered; then a tender light came into his faded eyes. 
He stooped and began to work again. 
"I guess maybe you didn't know about Miss Polly's love affair," he said slowly. 
"And the feller's livin' terdayright in this town, too." "Who is he?" 
I wouldn't stay if 'twa'n't for the wages and the folks at home what's needin' them. 
Miss Polly read the telegram, frowned, then climbed the stairs to the attic room. 
'Light hair, redchecked gingham dress, and straw hat'all she knows, indeed! 
"Imagine Miss Polly and a NOISY kid! 
"Oh, Timothy, II think it was mean ter send me," chattered the suddenly frightened Nancy, as she turned and hurried to a point where she could best watch the passengers alight at the little station. 
The little girl was standing quite by herself when Nancy finally did approach her. 
The Ladies' Aid bought it for meand wasn't it lovely of them, when they wanted the carpet so? 
Instinctively she felt that some one had to draw oneafter that speech. 
Then she stole a glance at Timothy. 
She said you'd think it was queer. 
But there weren't any black things in the last missionary barrel, only a lady's velvet basque which Deacon Carr's wife said wasn't suitable for me at all; besides, it had white spotsworn, you knowon both elbows, and some other places. 
Timothy turned to her with a quizzical smile. 
You can see it now," said Nancy. "It's that big white one with the green blinds, 'way ahead." 
I never knew any one that did have, only the Whitesthey're some rich. 
Your aunt don't like icecream, I guess; leastways I never saw it on her table." 
Just as it is when the PRETTY hairribbons come in the barrels after a lot of fadedout brown ones. My! but isn't this a perfectly beautiful house?" she broke off fervently, as they turned into the wide driveway. 
Without speaking, Pollyanna turned and followed her aunt from the room. 
"Why, Aunt Polly, AREN'T you?" queried Pollyanna, in frank wonder. 
Still more eagerly her big blue eyes tried to look in all directions at once, that no thing of beauty or interest in this wonderful house might be passed unseen. 
Then she saw that her aunt had thrown open a door at the right. 
Pollyanna hurriedly crossed to her side. 
That, too, soon flew up under her eager hands. 
Miss Polly frowned and tapped the floor with her slipper. 
When she comes down she may have bread and milk in the kitchen." "Yes, ma'am." It was well, perhaps, that Miss Polly did not happen to be looking at Nancy's face just then. 
"Whatever in the world are you talkin' about?" "Why, it's a game. 
"Oh, yes; the game was to just find something about everything to be glad aboutno matter what it was," rejoined Pollyanna, earnestly. 
"There isthere is," she crowed. 
"Humph!" choked Nancy, trying to swallow the lump in her throat. 
"I suppose, though, itit'll be a little harder now, as long as I haven't anybody to play it with. Maybe Aunt Polly will play it, though," she added, as an afterthought. "My stars and stockings!HER!" breathed Nancy, behind her teeth. 
"That'll be splendid! Won't we have fun?" "Ermaybe," conceded Nancy, in open doubt. 
Aunt Polly, with the bent old man, was leaning over a rosebush when Pollyanna, gurgling with delight, flung herself upon her. 
The man turned. 
I used ter know her when she was even littler than you be. 
Oh, please tell me about her!" And down plumped Pollyanna in the middle of the dirt path by the old man's side. 
A bell sounded from the house. 
Where did they come from?" "Why, Aunt Polly, they came from out of doors of course, through the windows. 
I SAW some of them come in." 
To her niece she said: "Pollyanna, I have ordered screens for those windows. 
Pollyanna, her eyes on the illustration of a fly's head, many times magnified, cried joyously: "Oh, thank you, Aunt Polly!" The next moment she skipped merrily from the room, banging the door behind her. 
I'm so glad you gave me that book to read! 
What are not suitable for you I shall give to the Sullivans, of course." With visible reluctance Pollyanna laid down the pamphlet and turned toward the closet. 
I'd rather, truly." "Very likely," observed Aunt Polly, with slightly uplifted eyebrows. 
You breathe all the time you're asleep, but you aren't living. 
But, surely, it seems to me if I am willing to do my duty in seeing that you have proper care and instruction, YOU ought to be willing to do yours by seeing that that care and instruction are not ungratefully wasted." Pollyanna looked shocked. 
"Why, Nancy, that's so! 
The screens had not yet come, and the close little room was like an oven. 
Just how long she lay in sleepless misery, tossing from side to side of the hot little cot, she did not know; but it seemed to her that it must have been hours before she finally slipped out of bed, felt her way across the room and opened her door. 
Downstairs in Miss Polly's room next the sun parlor, Miss Polly herself was hurrying into dressing gown and slippers, her face white and frightened. 
A minute before she had been telephoning in a shaking voice to Timothy: "Come up quick!you and your father. 
Miss Polly was stalking on ahead. 
She had more time, also, to "just live," as she expressed it, for almost all of every afternoon from two until six o'clock was hers to do with as she likedprovided she did not "like" to do certain things already prohibited by Aunt Polly. 
She was not dazed nor exhausted. 
"Oh, no, I don't mind it at all," she explained to Nancy. 
"I'm happy just to walk around and see the streets and the houses and watch the people. 
To herself Pollyanna always called him "the Man," no matter if she met a dozen other men the same day. 
"Did you speakto me?" he asked in a sharp voice. 
"Yes, sir," beamed Pollyanna. "I say, it's a nice day, isn't it?" "Eh? 
Pollyanna was carrying calf'sfoot jelly to Mrs. Snow today. 
She said she thought that it was her duty, inasmuch as Mrs. Snow was poor, sick, and a member of her churchit was the duty of all the church members to look out for her, of course. 
"How do you do?" began Pollyanna politely. 
"Well, Miss Impertinence, who are you?" she demanded. Pollyanna laughed gleefully. 
"Yes, when you might be just living, you know. 
They didn't tell me you were so pretty!" 
"Be glad about thingswhen you're sick in bed all your days? 
"Why, motherthe curtain is up!" cried Milly, dividing her amazed stare between the window and the pink in her mother's hair. 
He's John Pendleton. 
That Pollyanna had taken the skeleton literally instead of figuratively, she knew very well; but, perversely, she refrained from correcting the mistake. 
Obviously, however, she must say something. 
"I know. It IS awful! 
You asked me to tell you something to be glad aboutglad, you know, even though you did have to lie here abed all day." "Oh!" scoffed the woman. 
"And now I'll tell you the game," proposed Pollyanna, blithely confident. 
"All right," she sighed. 
But maybe I can next time!" One by one the July days passed. 
To Pollyanna, they were happy days, indeed. 
"Do you mean that it wouldn't be enough then, Aunt Polly, that they should be just happy days?" she asked wistfully. 
"O glory!" said Nancy to herself. 
"You see I'd just found out about the room, and I reckon you'd have banged doors if" Pollyanna stopped short and eyed her aunt with new interest. 
August brought several surprises and some changesnone of which, however, were really a surprise to Nancy. 
"And I was glad I didn't find any one who owned it, too," she told her aunt in happy confidence; " because I wanted to bring it home all the time. 
"Of course I knew," hurried on Pollyanna, gratefully, "that you wouldn't let a dear little lonesome kitty go hunting for a home when you'd just taken ME in; and I said so to Mrs. Ford when she asked if you'd let me keep it. 
"But, Pollyanna, Pollyanna," remonstrated Miss Polly. 
On a pleasant Thursday morning Pollyanna had been taking calf'sfoot jelly again to Mrs. Snow. 
Would she, now? 
"Gorry!" exclaimed Jimmy Bean tersely and uncomprehendingly, but admiringly. 
It's a real live boy. 
"This is Jimmy Bean, Aunt Polly." 
Miss Polly dropped back in her chair and raised a shaking hand to her throat. The old helplessness was threatening once more to overcome her. 
I ain't no beggar, you know." Pollyanna was frowning thoughtfully. 
I heard Aunt Polly say so. 
Besideswhat is a Ladies' Aid?" Pollyanna stared in shocked disapproval. 
"Why, Jimmy Bean, wherever have you been brought up?not to know what a Ladies' Aid is!" 
Pollyanna sprang to his side at once. 
"But I'm sure, when I see you tomorrow, I'll have just a common home and folks that do care all ready for you. Goodby!" she called brightly, as she turned back toward the house. 
You see I've played it so long." "You'vewhat?" demanded Aunt Polly. 
She could not forget that Aunt Polly had called Jimmy Bean a little beggar; and she did not want Aunt Polly to call him thatbefore the Ladies' Aid. 
Pollyanna colored a little. 
"Oh, I forgot to say; he will work," she supplemented eagerly. 
It was very beautiful in the Pendleton Woods, as Pollyanna knew by experience. 
A dog had barked some distance ahead. 
He was running back and forth, too, in the path ahead. Soon they reached a side path, and down this the little dog fairly flew, only to come back at once, whining and barking. 
On nearly every occasion there were despots' and dictators' signatures beneath all the suffering and disasters: Stalin, Lenin, Trotsky, Mao, Pol Pot, Hitler, Mussolini, Franco… While some of these men shared the same ideology, others were enemies to the death. 
Fascism and Communism come at the head of the ideologies that caused mankind to suffer those dark days. 
Evolutionary theory, after all, has a long and largely sordid history of application to human affairs. 
That is the truth that all human beings and the universe itself were created by Allah (God). 
To reply to stones by throwing others, to answer blows with blows, to answer the aggressor with more aggression is not a solution. 
Whereas, as the originator of the theory of evolution is not Darwin, so the source of the theory is not scientific proof. 
These two concepts, each a myth belonging to idolworshipping cultures, appeared in the modern world in the 18th century. 
One person who repeated Lamarck's claims, in a slightly different way, was Charles Darwin. 
He claimed that all species of living creatures came from one ancestor, born by chance in the water, and that they had grown different from one another by small changes which came about by coincidence. 
For example, the cell, which is today known to possess a most complicated system, was only visible as a blot through the simple microscopes in use at the time. 
Whatever the case, there was no change in the Darwinists' attachment to the theory of evolution. 
Because up until the 19th century the great majority of men of science looked at science as a method of learning and discovering what God had created. 
Because this belief was widespread, atheist and materialist philosophies were unable to find suitable ground in which to develop. 
Malthus had calculated that left to itself, the human population would increase at enormous speed. 
Here, then, I had at last got a theory by which to work.2 
It was attempted to establish links between every subject and Darwinism and to shed light on them from a Darwinist viewpoint. 
Because they were doing this in accordance with a "scientific" natural law. 
One of the foremost evolutionist scientists of our own time, the American palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould accepts the truth by writing that following the publication of The Origin of Species in 1859, "subsequent arguments for slavery, colonialism, racial differences, class struggles, and sex roles would go forth primarily under the banner of science."5 
Because human beings knew this divine religion, they at least had a measure of understanding that what they were doing was wrong when they engaged in violence. 
The disasters Darwinism brought to the world began in this way, and gathering speed, spread over the whole world. 
"Favoured races" emerged victorious from this struggle. 
At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate, and replace the savage races throughout the world. 
No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man.9 
As for the Darwinists who came after Darwin, they put up a great struggle to prove his racist views. 
And it was not only anthropologists: entomologists (those who study insects) also jumped on the racist bandwagon that Darwinism had set in motion with unbelievable claims. 
British Colonialism and Darwinism 
But, of course, starting with Great Britain, no colonialist country wanted to be seen as a "plunderer" and to go down in history as such. 
As a result of the massacres between then and now they have come to the position of being a lost race of less than 2 million. 
James Joll, who spent long years as professor of history at such universities as Oxford, Stanford and Harvard, in his source book Europe Since 1870, which is still used as a text book in universities, describes the ideological relationship between Darwinism, imperialism, and racism. 
The prohibition of opium, which the Chinese government had to implement after a long period of doubt, led to the first Opium War (18381842). 
Darwin's Enmity Towards the Turks 
In the last quarter of the century Britain and France joined the powers which were threatening the Ottomans. 
This nonsense of Darwin's was a written propaganda tool to give support to Britain's policy of destroying the Ottoman Empire. 
Roosevelt was the foremost proponent and implementer of the programme of ethnic cleansing applied against the Native Americans under the name of "forced relocation." 
In the book The Winning of the West, he founded the ideology of massacre, maintaining that a racial war to the finish with the Indians was inevitable.25 His greatest prop was Darwinism, which gave him the chance to define the natives as a backward species. 
In 1871, Congress disregarded all the treaties made with the Native Americans and decided to exile them to dead lands where they could await death. 
One of the foremost proponents of AngloSaxon racism, the American evolutionist and Protestant clergyman Josiah Strong, employed the same logic. 
The emergence of the first racial discrimination laws, known as the "Jim Crow Laws," (Jim Crow was one of the derogatory names for blacks used by the whites) also happened at this time. 
Blacks were definitely not treated like human beings, and were despised and treated with contempt everywhere: furthermore this was not the attitude of a few racist individuals but that determined by the American state by its own laws. 
In practice, this included hotels, theatres, libraries, and even lifts and churches. 
Madison Grant, author of the book The Passing of the Great Race (1916) wrote that the mixing of the two races will open the way to the emergence of a more primitive race than the inferior species, and he wanted interracial marriages to be banned.31 
Museums were not just interested in bones, at the same time they kept brains belonging to aborigines and sold them at good prices. 
The facts below bear witness to this ruthlessness: 
Edward Ramsay, curator of the Australian Museum in Sydney for 20 years from 1874, was particularly heavily involved. He published a museum booklet which appeared to include Aborigines under the designation of "Australian animals". 
"The welfare just grabbed you when they found you," one of the stolen children reported, many years later. "Our people would hide us, paint us with charcoal." 
All these terrible things the Australian natives suffered were just one small part of the catastrophes Darwinism has brought to the world. 
Man and Monkey Show Disapproved by Clergy 
And they are likely to inflict that cruelty feeling fully justified, because it is but a small step from believing another human being is inferior to believing that he is bad, dangerous, or threatening to 'superior' beings. 
For reasons of the climate they live in and natural conditions, many communities have lived isolated from general world society and have developed very different cultures. 
This is an indication of the art and variety of Allah's creation: 
… [Haeckel] argued that Darwin was correct … humankind had unquestionably evolved from the animal kingdom. 
In the popular state, the education of the mind and the body will play an important role, but human selection is just as important. …The state has the responsibility of declaring as unfit for reproductive purposes anyone who is obviously ill or genetically unsound. … and must carry through with this responsibility ruthlessly without respect to understanding or lack of understanding on the part of anyone. …Stopping reproduction of the bodily degenerate or psychically ill for a period of only 600 years would lead …to an improvement in human health which can hardly be envisaged today. 
Under a law passed in 1933, 350,000 mentally ill people, 30,000 gypsies, and hundreds of black children were sterilised by such methods as castration, xrays, injection, and electric shocks to the genital area. 
As well as attempting to hasten the development of the German race by the murder of and ruthless policies directed at innocent people, Hitler was also implementing another condition of eugenics. 
Individuals found not to match up to German race measurements were to be exterminated in the name of the principles of eugenics. 
The German Führer is an evolutionist; he has consciously sought to make the practice of Germany conform to the theory of evolution.55 
Hitler reasoned … that a higher race would always conquer a lower."56 The political philosophy of Nazi Germany took shape under the influence of these ideas of Hitler's. 
… struggle, selection, and survival of the fittest, all notions and observations arrived at … by Darwin … but already in luxuriant bud in the German social philosophy of the nineteenth century. … Thus developed the doctrine of Germany's inherent right to rule the world on the basis of superior strength … [of a] "hammer and anvil" relationship between the Reich and the weaker nations.57 
The Nazi ceremonies held in every corner of Germany were a return to the ancient pagan rites. 
Actually, the fundamental cause of the countless catastrophes visited upon the world in the 20th century was the character of such people as Hitler and the Nazis who had no religion. 
And not just Hitler: as we shall see later Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Franco, Mussolini and the others who drowned the 20th century in blood were known for being completely devoid of religion. 
The Catastrophes Brought About by the DarwinistFascist Mussolini 
Mussolini was a thorough Darwinist, who believed that violence had been a propelling force in history and that war led to revolution. 
He did not delay in backing and justifying his occupation of Ethiopia with Darwinism's racialist views. 
Franco dragged his people into civil war, turning brother against brother, father against son. 
The Fascists entered a town with a population of 11,000 near Seville and killed more than 300 people. 
The greatest supporters of the Fascist Franco in the Civil War were Hitler and Mussolini. 
We have seen how Darwinian ideas had a great influence on the ideology of imperialism at the end of the nineteenth century, but it is important to realise how literally the doctrine of the struggle for existence and of the survival of the fittest was taken by the majority of the leaders of Europe in the years preceding the First World War. 
He saw war as not only for eliminating weaker races, but also as a force for disposing of weaker members of the master race. 
Haeckel proposed, on the subject of war, that the savage methods of the Spartans, one of the city states that made up Ancient Greece, should be implemented. 
Firmly convinced that evolution was true, Hitler saw himself as the modern savior of humankind… By breeding a superior race, the world would look upon him as the man who pulled humanity up to a higher level of evolution.72 
Of course there had been countless wars in the world before Darwin put his theory forward. 
The NeoNazis 
On the Internet pages which they set up for Nazi and racist propaganda it is possible to come across Darwin's words and praise for Darwin, because Darwin gives support to all the NeoNazis' movements and ideas. 
A building lived in by Turks was set fire to in Memingen. 
Attacks and murders by these Fascist groups, the inheritors of Darwin and Fascists such as Hitler, still continue. 
The sure way to put an end to them is to wage a serious ideological war alongside the legal measures. 
The outrages perpetrated by these people who see racism as a law of nature will not come to an end so long as Darwinist ideas are not knocked down as science. 
No matter how much Communism is thought of as having been torn down in 1991, the debris it left behind it still exists. 
Darwin proposed his theory of evolution in his book The Origin of Species. 
Engels too admitted his admiration for Darwin elsewhere: 
In this connection, Darwin must be named before all others.82 
Marx and Engels accepted evolution almost immediately after Darwin published The Origin of Species. Evolution, of course, was just what the founders of communism needed to explain how mankind could have come into being without the intervention of any supernatural force, and consequently it could be used to bolster the foundations of their materialistic philosophy. 
Tom Bethell, of Harper's Magazine, explains the fundamental link between Marx and Darwin in the following manner: 
Today the link between Darwinism and Marxism is an obvious truth accepted by everyone. 
"Darwinism presented a whole string of truth supporting Marxism and proving and developing the truth of it. 
The chaos after World War I gave the Bolsheviks the opportunity they had been seeking. 
In Stalin's period the Soviet Union had turned into an environment of chaos where for millions of people life was permanently under threat, and where they could be taken away, though innocent of any crime, at any moment, to suffer unimagined torments. 
The cause of these inhuman and unbalanced leaders dragging millions along behind them, and which allowed them to commit crimes, was the apparent scientific force and support given to them by materialist philosophy and Darwinism. 
Rich men sponsored cheap Chinese editions so they could be widely distributed to the masses.96 
So, the people who turned to Communism and lead the Communist revolution were these intellectuals who had been "eagerly influenced" by Darwinist ideas. 
Our being at one with the animals was no great shock… Today, the official philosophy is MarxistLeninism (of a kind). 
The Basis of the Alliance Between Darwinism and Communism: Hatred of Religion 
Materialist philosophy had existed throughout history, but until the 19th century most philosophers had been restricted to books of theory. 
On account of these catastrophes tens of millions of people lost their lives, and hundreds of millions were shamefully oppressed and had to suffer the worst treatment. 
Stalin's demolition of dozens of churches and mosques is just one indication of Communism's hatred of religion. 
The most successful of these, thus far, seems to be communism, and its adherents all over the world have been deluded into thinking that communism must be true because it is based on the science of evolution. 
Men of religion would be taken into custody for no reason, and some of them were killed while in custody. 
The reason for all these practices was, without the shadow of a doubt, Communism's aim of forming societies which would blindly deny the existence of God, had nothing to do with religion, and which only believed in and valued material things. 
Actually, that was one of Communism's main targets, because the Communist leaders knew that they could only govern as they wished people who had become like machines, and insensitive, unfeeling, and most important of all, nongodfearing societies, and that they could make them carry out as many killings and as much oppression as they wanted. 
Trotsky went even further in another speech, 
…a whole continent of terror… Compared with those who brought about the hundreds of thousands of executions and the millions of deaths in the Soviet terror system, the Czars seem almost benign… Our minds boggle at the thought of a systematized, routine evil, under which three or four or more million men and women were sentenced each year to forced labour and eternal exile–and in a manner so casual that the prisoners often were not even told what their sentences were...108 
The families, and sometimes even the neighbours, of those who opposed the regime and were not apprehended, were systematically taken hostage and sent to concentration camps. 
It was as if they believed that the more people they killed, the greater success they would have. 
"When the Stalinists decided to open a cheka," one victim recalled; There was a small cemetery being cleaned out nearby. 
Others they locked in tiny cupboards with just a tiny air hole near the face to breathe through… One of the worst methods was known as "the drawer"; prisoners were forced to squat in tiny square boxes for several days. 
Some were kept there unable to move for eight to ten days.113 
To achieve these objectives there is nothing it is afraid to do, nothing for which it has respect or reverence. When comes to power, it is ferocious in its cruelty and inhumanity. 
The disasters brought about by Communism did not stop in Russia. One of the countries worst affected among those to which it spread was China. THE OPPRESSION IN EASTERN TURKESTAN 
The June 1989 Tienanmen Square massacre (about 1,000 dead) is one example of what China has gone through in its recent history. 
The sole reason for the savagery and oppression inflicted by these leaders is lack of religion and the fact these people had no fear of God. 
A human being who fears God and who has firm faith in the hereafter, will definitely be incapable of carrying out any of the oppression, wrongs, injustice, and murders that we have described. 
But people who have no religion and no fear of God know no limits. 
But while they were doing all this, God knew of it, and He will answer what they have done. 
Allah has recorded it while they have forgotten it. 
Allah has knowledge of all things. 
Rejecting all these because they prevent natural evolutionary progress, Ross declared that "The shortest way to make this world a heaven is to let those so inclined hurry hellward at their own pace."123 
In his article Darwin's Three Mistakes, the evolutionary scientist Kenneth J. Hsü, reveals the Darwinist thoughts of America's foremost capitalists: 
Darwinism was also used in a defense of competitive individualism and its economic corollary of laissezfaire capitalism in England and in America. 
Today the reason for countries such as Ethiopia falling victim to drought and starvation is the dominance of this capitalist morality. 
In societies of this kind the divide between rich and poor grows ever wider, as the poor grow poorer, the wealth of the rich grows greater. 
Evolution, in short, gave the doer of evil a respite from his conscience. 
We made everything on the earth adornment for it so that We could test them to see whose actions are the best. 
They will say, 'Yes, we have!' 
Between them a herald will proclaim: 'May the curse of Allah be on the wrongdoers those who bar access to the Way of Allah, desiring to make it crooked, and reject the hereafter.' .... 
A violent moral and spiritual collapse swiftly comes to societies which turn away from religion. 
There are many examples of this in societies in our day. 
At this point some people will say that Darwinism cannot be held responsible for peoples' lack of religion because a large number of those people who live a life without religion have never heard of the claims of Darwinism. 
If you reject God and replace Him with another belief that puts chance, random processes in the place of God, there is no basis for right or wrong. 
The idea that progress, development, and civilisation are the result of people living separate from one another and with no ties of mutual assistance, devotion, respect, and affection, is imposed upon societies. 
The truth is that man is not a species of animal and did not come into existence from any animal. 
As the influence of this view grows in society, there emerge irresponsible people who believe themselves to be totally unrestricted. 
And it can be seen that, even though most people are unaware of the details of Darwinism, they live the life that Darwinism foresaw for mankind. 
He who believes that the only point to life is to pass on his genes, and that everything ends with death, that nothing he does in the world has any meaning, who thinks that friendship, love, goodness, and beauty have no value, will think that life is pitiless and unnecessary and will be able to take no pleasure from anything. 
Gone is purpose; all that is left is direction. 
The thought Nietzsche put forward, known as "nihilism" or "nothingism" is basically this: Man must have a reason for living. 
But if, like Nietzsche, a person absolutely rejects the fundamental purpose and starts to look for a purpose outside the scope of this truth, then of course he is not going to be able to find it. 
Whatever happens he gives thanks to God: for which reason he never falls prey to hopelessness and pessimism. 
With the collapse of Darwinism from the cultural and scientific point of view, those philosophies which draw strength from it will also disappear, and this will mean the lifting of oppression from the world. 
For this reason a heavy responsibility falls to those who possess conscience and faith, who have knowledge of spiritual values. 
These disasters will come to an end as people turn to the true religion, when the beauty, love, affection, compassion, justice, devotion, cooperation, and tolerance which the Qur'an brings to peoples' lives are widely lived. 
Say: 'Truth has come and falsehood has vanished. 
Falsehood is always bound to vanish.' 
Darwin hoped that the difficulties facing his theory would be overcome as science developed in time and that new scientific discoveries would reinforce it. 
The defenders of the theory of evolution resisted Pasteur's findings for a long time. 
The invalidity of that experiment, which in those years was regarded as an important step in the name of evolution, and that the atmosphere used in the experiment was very different from the conditions of the real world, emerged in the years that followed.139 
The wellknown evolutionist professor Leslie Orgel, from San Diego California University, admits this truth in the October 1994 edition of Scientific American magazine: 
Yet it also seems impossible to have one without the other. 
And so, at first glance, one might have to conclude that life could never, in fact, have originated by chemical means.142 
For this reason the mechanism of natural selection possesses no evolutionary force. 
The theory maintains that the millions of living species in the world emerged as a result of mutations, or genetic defects over time, in these living creatures' countless complex organs, such as ears, eyes, lungs, and wings. 
A random change in a watch cannot improve the watch. 
It will most probably harm it or at best be ineffectual. 
For example, in the past, although fish still bore their own features, they must also have gained some features of reptiles, and halffish halfreptile creatures must have lived. 
In other words, in the fossil record, all species of living creature emerged suddenly and in their finished form, with no intermediate form between them. 
Fossils reveal that living creatures emerged in the world fully and perfectly formed. 
This, of course, definitely demonstrates the invalidity that these classes were one another's' ancestors. 
Zuckerman also made an interesting "spectrum of science." 
After that come biological sciences, and then social sciences. 
Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of "how we see". 
That means that the inside of the brain is solid dark, and light does not reach the location where the brain is situated. 
The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the 20th century has not been able to attain it. 
Moreover, the TV screen shows you a twodimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a threedimensional perspective having depth. 
If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. 
But the theory of evolution is being determinedly kept on the scientific agenda. 
But why?… 
When it was first declared operational in 2132, Excalibur's announced purpose was to give Earth ample warning of any future alien visitors: one as gigantic as Rama could be detected at interstellar distancesyears, it was hoped, before it could have any effect on human affairs. 
That original commitment to build Excalibur had been made even before Rama had passed perihelion. As the first extraterrestrial visitor rounded the sun and headed out toward the stars, armies of scientists studied the data from the only mission that had been able to rendezvous with the intruder. 
The primary justification for the refurbishment of Excalibur was scientific. 
TEST AND TRAINING The bizarre metallic creature inched along the wall, crawling up toward the overhang. 
It resembled a skinny armadillo, its jointed snail body covered by a thin shell that curled over and around a compact grouping of electronic gadgetry astride the middle of its three sections. A helicopter hovered about two meters away from the wall. A long flexible arm with a pincer on the end extended from the nose of the helicopter and just missed closing its jaws around the odd creature. 
Even in perfect conditions it's hard to do precision work with these claws at full extension." 
Tabori felt his grip loosening. 
In less than a second, a whining alarm sounded and the cockpit monitor flashed red. EXCESSIVE DAMAGE. 
Tabori and Brown followed. 
Even with its onboard automatic landing algorithm active and in complete control, the damaged flying machine bounced hard on its struts when it hit the ground and tipped over on its side. 
Dr. David Brown eventually looked over at Borzov with a sullen, baleful stare. When he finally spoke in his own defense, his speech was clipped and strained, belying the emotion he was suppressing. 
He had turned around to finish stuffing his parachute into its transparent package. 
The door from the conference room opened and a smiling, ruddy face appeared. "We're all here waiting for you,' said General O'Toole pleasantly. "I think Borzov's becoming a little impatient." Francesca switched off the lights and put her video camera back in the pocket ">f her flight suit. 
She walked over and put her arms gently around the small man. 
The famed Japanese interdisciplinary scientist Shigeru Takagishi, widely regarded as the foremost expert in the world on the first Raman expedition seventy years earlier (and also the author of the Atlas of Rama that was required reading for all of the crew), was sitting in the middle of the oval between Soviet pilot Irina Turgenyev and the brilliant but often zany British cosmonaut/electrical engineer Richard Wakefield. 
Janos Tabori started to ask a question but Borzov interrupted him and launched again into his monologue. 
"Only after those two priorities are satisfied and the Raman craft is adjudged harmless does the capturing of one or more of the biots have any significance." 
I would like to remind General Borzov," David Brown said almost immediately in his sonorous voice, "that some of us do not believe the priorities should be blindly applied in a serial fashion. 
Let me refresh your memory with a few of the more salient points, in case you've forgotten. 
It has been a long day at the end of an extremely busy seventeen days of activity. 
This conversation will be better when we are all fresh." 
The surge of unabashed selfindulgence on a global scale was easy to understand. 
It was just a question of time before the prevailing homocentric notion of the universe was to be irrevocably shattered by clearer awareness of the Others. Thus it was easy to comprehend why the life patterns of most human beings suddenly veered toward selfgratification, reminding literary scholars of a similar time almost exactly five centuries earlier, when Robert Herrick had exhorted the virgins to make the most of their fleeting time in a poem that began, "Gather you rosebuds while you may/ Old time is still aflying...." 
There was unprecedented prosperity and the net result was a shortterm but significant improvement in the standard of living for almost all humans. By the end of the year in 2133, it had become obvious to some of the more experienced observers of human history that the "Raman Boom" was leading mankind toward disaster. 
The communications load on the Global Network System (GNS) was immense. 
Data gridlock delayed transactions for minutes, then hours, contributing additional momentum to the panic. 
There is unanimous agreement that The Great Chaos profoundly altered human civilization in every way. No segment of society was immune. The catalyst for the relatively rapid collapse of the existing institutional infrastructure was the market crash and subsequent breakdown of the global financial system; however, these events would not have been sufficient, by themselves, to project the world into a period of unprecedented depression. 
Isolated wars and civil disturbances did erupt from time to time, primarily in the undeveloped nations, but the concerted efforts of the global peacekeeping forces always contained these problems before they became too serious. 
These services were intended to limit the difficulties created by the supposedly temporary presence of these hordes of idle and underfed individuals. 
In early 2138 a remarkable series of events occurred in Italy. 
The four years from 2138 to 2142 were not good years to be alive. 
By 2143 only a very few hard core colonists remained on the Moon and Mars. 
Communications between Earth and the colonies had become intermittent and erratic. 
As the years passed, and the children born after its conclusion reached adolescence, they were confronted by parents who were cautious to the point of phobia. 
Only the developed nations participated actively. 
She was dressed in a stark brown suit, sexless, with a highcollar blouse. 
The DTC covered a mammoth area, almost twentyfive square kilometers. 
More than a thousand people, most of whom worked at the DTC and found life easier when there was no commute, lived in the apartments that formed a semicircle around the shopping center south of the main terminal. 
The terminal itself housed four major hotels, seventeen restaurants, and over a hundred different shops, including a branch of the chic Donatelli fashion chain. 
Helen Caudill and Jeremy Temple. Before she was really big. 
They fall in love while talking about their failed expectations. 
Not surprising, Francesca had mused when she heard her husband's comment, since he absolutely is. 
I have both freedom and security. 
In her mind's eye she was inside the plane, as she would be the next day on her flight home to Rome. 
But her thoughts jumped back quickly to the real world, to the contracts that David Brown had signed just before she had left his home that afternoon. 
As soon as she opened the door she could hear the sound of heavy breathing. 
Its portals and fancy connecting passageways were abandoned for years to the grasses, water birds, alligators, and ubiquitous insects of Central Florida. 
All of the simulation exercises for the cosmonauts, however, were conducted over at LEO3 with the backup equipment. The cosmonauts would only use the actual flight systems at LEO2 during the last week before launch. 
I have had men tell me before that I resemble a cat. But never a tiger." 
Among other things," Francesca answered nonchalantly. She ignored the implied criticism in his comment. 
But I had no idea that it was going to be billed as the party of the century, as it was called last week by one of those American personality magazines. 
After all, not only is she a doctor and a linguist and a former Olympic champion, but also she is the daughter of a famous novelist and the mother of a fourteenyearold daughter, despite never having been married" 
And unless I misjudged him he will understand immediately. She pulled a small cubic object out of her briefcase and handed it across the desk. "This is the only other item on my agenda," she said. The Newton commanderinchief seemed puzzled. 
He turned the cube over in his hands. 
"I'm the only one who has seen the entire thing." 
She knew better than to say anything just yet. 
To the side of her was a tall Japanese man in a blue dress suit. He was listening carefully to a question from the audience. Nicole interrupted him to acknowledge the new arrivals. 
"Dobriy Utra," Nicole said to the general, quickly nodding a greeting in Francesca's direction as well. "This is the esteemed Dr. Toshiro Hakamatsu," Nicole said. 
Thank you," the man replied, bowing in the direction of Borzov after shaking his hand. "It is an honor for me to be part of this project." Francesca and General Borzov took the two empty seats at the front of the auditorium and the meeting continued. Nicole aimed her pointer at a keyboard on the side of a small podium and a fullscale, multicolored male model of the human cardiovascular system, with veins marked in blue and arteries in red, appeared, as a threedimensional holographic image in the front of the room. 
Even under those conditions there was no sign that any rejection mechanisms were triggered in any of the test subjects. 
Four went to the brain, three more to the heart, four to the primary glands of the endocrine system, and the remaining twentyone monitors spread out to assorted locations and organs ranging from the eyes to the fingers and toes. 
She held up a small, flat, thin object with a keyboard on it. 
Nicole saw many confused looks in her audience. "I'd better back up and start this part of the explanation again," she said. 
1 thought I was dying." 
First, each specific monitor tests its own battery of sensors more than twenty times a day. 
"Any more questions?" she asked. 
They were more than fifty thousand feet below her. 
It was the beginning of the holiday break for the cosmonauts and, except for that stupid party in Rome at the end of the year, Nicole was supposedly free until she had to report to LEO3 on January 8. 
Again Takagishi stopped talking to drink some of his tea. 
You'll recall that up until that time, no physical examinations of any kind had been conducted." 
That's right, Nicole remembered. The potential crew was first reduced to fortyeight and then we were all taken to Heidelberg for the physicals. 
When your countryman Blamont, who had already flown half a dozen major missions for the ISA, was disqualified from consideration because of that trivial heart murmurand the Cosmonaut Selection Board subsequently upheld the doctors by denying his appealI completely panicked." 
He paused to choose his words carefully. 
He is a brilliant man, my American counterpart, but he is also, in my opinion, too certain of his own infallibility. 
He is not one of the space cadets, she was now thinking, so his role is not absolutely critical to mission success. 
As he had repeated the words of his lessons over and over and committed them to memory, he had imagined himself, maybe fifty years in the future, wearing the cassock and papal ring, celebrating mass for thousands in the great churches and stadia of the world. 
What is the significance of the particular sequence of events? 
The cosmonaut automatically dropped to one knee and kissed the papal ring. 
For me as well," the pope replied in lightly accented English. "I have been following the activities of you and your colleagues with great interest." 
A very large, dark wood desk stood on one side of the room under a lifesize portrait of JohnPaul IV, the man who had become pope during the darkest days of The Great Chaos and had provided both the world and the church with twenty years of energetic and inspirational leadership. 
And if so, did God send Jesus, or perhaps his Raman equivalent, to save them from their sins? 
The pope's smile broadened almost into a grin. 
But what do you personally believe, Your Holiness?" O'Toole persisted. "Did the creatures who made these two incredible space vehicles commit some original sin and also need a savior sometime in their history? 
The pope interrupted himself and looked intently at General O'Toole. "Yes," he continued softly, "I said Jesus. 
Even within the church there are those who have an altogether different view of the Ramans." 
It could affect my actions on the mission." 
That's true of most of the survivors of The Chaos. 
I don't know about the other two," 
We are sending a crew of a dozen to rendezvous with it" He turned toward General O'Toole. 
Holy Father," he said, "thank you again for seeing me and sharing this time. 
JohnPaul V smiled and walked over to his guest. 
There were twelve alcoves or chapels attached to the central nave, six with sculpture and artwork following classical Roman Catholic motifs and the other six each honoring one of the world's major religions. 
This eclectic partition of the ground floor was purposely designed to provide comfort for the many nonCatholics who made pilgrimages to the shrine to pay their respects to the memory of the beloved St. Michael. 
The arrangement of the frescoes themselves, which follow the life of the saint in a chronological order, flows in a clockwise direction. Thus the final painting, commemorating Michael's canonization ceremony at Rome in 2188, is right next to the painting of his birth in the Siena cathedral seventytwo years earlier. The frescoes were designed and implemented by a team of four artists, including the master Feng Yi from China, who appeared suddenly in the spring of 2190 without any prior notification. Despite the fact that very little was known outside China of his skill, the other three artists, Rosa da Silva from Portugal, Fernando Lopez from Mexico, and Hans Reichwein from Switzerland, immediately welcomed Feng Yi to their team on the strength of the superb sketches that he had brought with him." 
And they never understood what you meant by the final evolution. 
You had called them to come to Rome to join you, To show the world that everyone was united. 
And so they came. 
The tenth painting showed Michael in his blue robes, standing high on the steps of the Victor Emmanuel Monument next to the Piazza Venezia. 
Everyone's expecting me, especially the press, according to Francesca Sabatini. 
I really am highstrung tonight, Nicole thought as she leafed through the magazine Italia and waited for her food. 
In her television interview two months earlier with Yamanaka, a frustrated Francesca Sabatini, after ten minutes of twoand threeword, monosyllabic responses to all her questions, had asked Hiro if the rumor about his being an android were true. 
When the car turned off the main road between Rome and Tivoli to drive the final mile to the Villa Adriana, the traffic became congested. 
Why have you refused all personal interviews?" 
Nicole said nothing as the security men held back the crowd and led her to a covered electric cart. 
This man died over two thousand yean ago, Nicole thought to herself, remembering her history. One of the smartest humans who ever lived. 
You may recall that we passed the ruins of the original at the beginning of the ride. 
It was basically round in shape, about forty meters in diameter. 
Around the building the guests mixed and talked and drank; advanced robot waiters rolled around carrying large trays of champagne and wine and other alcoholic spirits. 
After a moment she leaned over playfully and forced one of his eyelids open. 
That's impossible." 
"Where did they find" 
"The water surrounding this house is the Cylindrical Sea, the porticoes represent the Central Pkin, and we, lovely lady, are sitting in the city of New York." 
"Then perhaps you and I should go to watch a dolphin show and I will speak to you of Ramans there and Romans here, of cabbages and kings, of dumdedum and sealing wax, and whether pigs have wings." 
A gold scarf was tied around her waist. Her long blond hair was braided and pinned against her head. 
The other eight elements were filled with different pictures and shapes. 
The humans made their first error on the eighth matrix, the dolphins on the ninth. 
Or maybe even one millionth? 
Okagesama de," she replied. Nicole leaned across to her Japanese colleague and whispered in his ear. 
The cameras were still rolling. 
Julien had his arm around her back and was singing lustily. He was also leading the group of twenty or so people clustered around them in singing the final words. 
She struggled hard, finally succeeding in freeing herself from Julien's grasp. 
Nicole watched him disinterestedly, as if she were in a movie theater, or even in one of her own dreams. 
Francesca Sabatini restrained Reggie as a confused David Brown retreated from her embrace. 
Nicole backpedaled with each of his steps. 
When they were in the center of her hotel room and only three or four feet apart, the old man looked up at the ceiling and began to chant. 
Nicole smiled. 
Henry never even suspected. 
Not until that night at Buckingham Palace. 
The two guards vanished as quickly as they had appeared and Nicole saw Darren, smiling as always, occupying the doorway to the chalet. 
I'm fine, Darren," she answered, aware that despite all her lectures to herself, she was already starting to feel nervous. 
His voice was soft and tender. 
Their eyes again locked in a deep communication. 
He extended a data cube toward her. "This is the most valuable gift I could find for you," he said seriously, "and it has taken many marks from the royal treasury to compile it." 
My intuitive sense tells me that this crew of yours will have problems. 
Nicole's brow furrowed. 
"Why are you meddling" 
You're the life science officer. You can treat it however you want." 
He reached up with his hand and very slowly wrapped his fingers around hers. 
He turned around to look at her. 
And he was always in a foul mood. 
Go on," said Janos, "tell him that you love him. 
That's what the fairy queen Titania would do,' 
The little robot was temporarily quiet. 
A second small robot, this one dressed as an elf, leapt into the room. 
Bottom was sleeping in the corner near the edge of Janos' bed. 
In addition he's a Shakespeare fanatic. 
His smile acknowledged her compliment. 
Nicole was laughing as she stepped over the sprite and waved good night to her friends. 
On this evening, however, with the goal of their mission now so close at hand, it was necessary for her to work out for a longer time to calm her hyperactive system. 
Nicole walked slowly over to the computer. "What's going on?" she said casually, her eyes scanning the information on the screen. 
Nicole suddenly reached over and grabbed the bottle out of Francesca's hand. 
Nicole discovered that the liquid in her hand was for inducing abortions and quickly followed Francesca into the lobby. 
I wish to abort the embryo. 
This baby is unwanted. Now, should I be more graphic" 
She also tested Francesca for her acceptability to receive the abortion liquid. 
The fetus had been growing inside Francesca for five days. 
But you are already alive. 
The fetus would be swept away, rejected by her body, within twentyfour hours. There could possibly be some slight cramping with the normal menstruation that would follow immediately. 
Brown and Takagishi took their positions in the control center once the operation of the Alpha relay station was verified. 
The northern half of the Central Plain spread out to fill most of the picture on the screen. 
Equally striking in the image were the long straight grooves or valleys of the Central Plain. 
Then Dr. David Brown started hooting. "All right, Rama," he said in a proud voice. 
There are two major purposes for our first visit: to establish the communications/transportation infrastructure and to complete a detailed survey of the interior, ensuring that this spaceship is exactly like the first one" 
YouVe concocted an apparently logical excuse to hide the real reason for my exclusion from the first sortie team. 
It's always someone else who is at fault, isn't it Dr. Brown?" General Borzov said, smiling at his adversary. 
He remained in his room while the other eleven crew members feasted on game hens and wild rice. 
There was a momentary quiet in the room before Francesca began to recite. 
Then Janos Tabori stood at his chair. 
Yuch," said Janos a moment later, as he passed the infrared scanner to Nicole. 
Nicole also swallowed the worm quickly, commenting to herself that the only thing she had ever eaten that tasted worse than the worm was that awful tuber during her Poro ceremony in the Ivory Coast. 
That Wakefield really is a genius, she was thinking. How is he able to design such extraordinary detail into those little things? 
Indeed she was. As the words "Unsex me here" came from the robot, her (or its) shape began to change. 
DEATH OF A SOLDIER In her dream Nicole was ten years old again and playing in the woods behind her home in the Paris suburb of ChillyMazarin. 
She had a sudden feeling that her mother was dying. The little girl panicked. She ran toward the house to tell her father. A small snarling cat blocked her path. 
Nicole extracted a small data cube from the scanner and inserted it into the diagnostician. 
In about thirty seconds the little monitor blinked and the words 94% LIKELY APPENDICITIS appeared. 
Everyone was there except Wilson and Takagishi, both of whom had skipped the movie. "But I won't make the project wait. We'll go ahead with the first and second sorties while I'm recuperating." 
"Go prepare RoSur for the operation. 
She turned around to Francesca. "I recognize that this is big news. 
But 1 could use one more pair of hands, as an emergency backup." 
Not much," he grumbled. 
My God, Nicole thought, we're going to remove ... 
"Stop it," she shouted. "Stop the operation." 
General O'Toole and Franceses were both thrown against the far wall. 
In the two hours immediately after the operation, Rama went through a sequence of three more maneuvers, each, like the first one, lasting one or two minutes. 
At the time Nicole did not think his omission was important. The required teleconferences with ISA officials were extremely painful. 
Nicole was interrogated about her sobriety at the time of the operation. 
And the stereo cameras should have transmitted a message indicating that the observed images were at variance with the predicted images. But for some reason neither sensor set was successful in interrupting the ongoing operation. 
She asked a statistical routine to compute the likely cause of the symptoms, given the fact that it could not be an appendicitis. 
Would you like to explain to all of us how this asteroid of dumb metal happened to know that General Borzov was having an appendectomy at that very minute? 
In that case," Admiral Heilmann responded, "we would submit the item in question to a vote of all the cosmonauts." 
Admiral Heilmann has been a close colleague of Valeriy Borzov's for many years. None of us has a solid overall command of all aspects of the mission. To split the duties would be" 
"All right," Otto Heilmann said a few minutes later, "we must now choose our leaders. 
"I think we must be careful at this point not to lose the team spirit that we have worked so hard to develop during the past year. 
"I'm sorry, Janos. I'm imposing on you. 
There's nothing more you can learn here. RITE OF PASSAGE Genevieve suddenly broke into tears. "Oh, Mother,' she said. 
My darling daughter, she thought, you must know how much I love you. If only I could spare you from this pain. 
Nicole wanted to reach out and comfort Genevieve, to hold her close, to share one of those motherdaughter caresses that chase away the demons. 
An image of her mother's funeral came to Nicole's mind. 
Together it was easier to bear. 
I'm French, not African. 
She didn't want her fear or anxiety to be transferred to her daughter. Nevertheless, Nicole could tell that her mother was troubled. "Your hands are cold and sweaty, Mama," she whispered in French as she hugged Anawi before departing. 
The tuber is something very special. 
There was a strong spring in the grove where the water rushed out of the ground and formed a circular pool about ten meters in diameter. 
With her head underwater and her eyes closed, she swam and swam and fantasized that she was in the community pool in her suburb near Paris. 
Where they had been before, she found fresh prints of some kind. 
That would make sense, the little girl thought logically. 
They stopped here and were curious about my things. 
She dropped down on her stomach and crawled slowly along the path. 
But where to spend the night? 
The little girl shuddered and scraped the ants off with a stick. 
She zoomed toward it, her bird shrieks piercing the calm of the night. 
She tried to flap her wings. 
There it was a magnificent symphony, enhancing the beauty of the majestic Earth below her. She heard her name being called. 
Who could be calling way out here? 
The lioness didn't move. 
The girl, still softly singing, continued walking toward the animal. 
So why am I feeling sorry for myself now? she thought. 
Her mind was working overtime again, trying to formulate a plan that would give her the crucial answers to what had happened during the operation on Borzov. 
Hello, Nicole," Francesca said, as she opened the door. "What can we do for you?" 
General Borzov's photographs of his wife and children, along with his favorite painting, a picture of a solitary bird with outstretched wings soaring above the Neva River in Leningrad, had been replaced by huge sequencing charts. The charts, each one headed by a different name (First Sortie, Second Sortie, etc.), covered the side bulletin boards from one end of the wall to the other. 
She had not expected that it would be necessary also for her to explain everything to Francesca. 
I have read the assignments for the first sortie," Nicole said eventually in a formal tone, "and I would like to make a request. 
My duties, as outlined in the sequence, are minimal. 
"I would have thought that you couldn't wait to see the inside of Rama." 
I've read all the documents you wrote for General Borzov. 
They are quite adequate." 
Had he been taking medication without her knowledge? 
Eighteen menu items were immediately displayed on the monitor. 
In addition to mundane items like height, weight, and number of siblings, the chart listed two other numbers: IE (for Intelligence Evaluation) and SC (for Socialization Coefficient). 
Negative IE indices indicated belowaverage intelligence. 
They too were based on a battery of standardized tests administered to all students between the ages of twelve and twenty, but the interpretation here was easier to understand. 
His task was to perform unspecified "consulting" for a wide variety of postNewton media endeavors in support of what was referred to as the BrownSabatini project. 
December 2193: Brown awarded top ISA medal for Distinguished Scientific Achievement. 
"And our new commander was right. You do look as if you might benefit from some rest." 
Could be," was the response. 
Don't forget to fasten your seat belt," Wakefield reminded her with a smile. "If the cable were to slow down or stop near the top, where you are weightless, your momentum could cause you to sail out into the Raman void." 
The second rover will probably be operational before noon tomorrow if we don't encounter any difficulties." 
That's a possible scenario," Dr. Brown responded. 
Three kilometers below him, cut into the Central Plain, the long straight valleys that ran from the edge of the bowl to the Cylindrical Sea suddenly exploded with light. 
You will not fall, he said to himself. 
From the ensuing conversation he could tell that Hiro, startled by the burst of light, had lost his footing near the middle of the Gamma stairway. 
Are you all right?" David Brown asked. I think so," Yamanaka answered breathlessly. 
He simply stared, entranced by the world below him. 
The frozen sea seemed illogical and out of place. 
To Richard its skyscrapers had not been too imposing in the views that had been offered by the light from the flares. 
"That's where they live. 
Considering the regular abuse that he received from his neurotic rather and the emotional scars that must remain from his youthful marriage to British actress Sarah Tydings, Cosmonaut Wakefield is remarkably well adjusted. 
Although his SC was low as a youth, he has grown less arrogant as he has matured and is now less likely to force his brilliance upon others. 
Knowledge, not power or money, seems to be his goal...." 
The overall intelligence level of the crew was quite impressive. 
She resolved to talk to Wakefield. After determining that she could add her own files to the king's data cube, she created a new file, a nineteenth file, simply called NICOLE. 
General O'Toole was dozing in the CCC (Command and Control Complex) of the military spacecraft when Nicole arrived to give him a break. 
Nicole sat down at the console and entered the handover code. 
She told me that thinking about Rama had made her a Catholic again." There was a long silence. 
He smiled. 
Into her mind came a picture of Francesca Sabatini listening intently while General O'Toole waxed philosophical about the religious significance of Rama. 
You know," he said at length to Cosmonauts Wakefield and Sabatini, "I don't believe the reports the first crew gave on New York are entirely accurate. Or else this is a different spaceship." 
Francesca walked over to the Japanese scientist. 
We've overflown many of the features of the Northern Hemicylinder this afternoon," Brown said. 
The cities look like duplicates of each other. 
To his left the unimposing narrow stairway cut in the cliff descended in short steps. 
Are you certain you don't want to wait for me to install the pulleys? 
I can help carry it," Francesca interjected. 
They parked the icemobile on the edge of the frozen sea and walked along a path until they found a stairway leading to the ramparts of the wall surrounding the city. 
Richard was immediately intrigued by the geometrical shapes of the buildings. In addition to the normal tall, thin skyscrapers, there were scattered spheres, rectangular solids, even an occasional polyhedron. 
He turned around to acknowledge the question and noticed that his knees had become weak. 
"I'm trying to find the light on my video camera." 
I want complete quiet,' David Brown shouted over the communications system, "until everyone is accounted for." 
We're climbing the stairway up the wall, on the New York side, David, about a hundred meters from where we parked the icemobile. 
He reached down and turned off both his and Walcefield's commpak. 
Yes," said Takagishi, quietly but excitedly. "Like something is brushing against a metallic surface. 
Wait," said Takagishi as Richard stood up. 
You're way overdue for a report." 
"Takagishi was really quite irritated with Dr. Brown, wasn't he?" Richard was saying to Janos as he helped the little Hungarian disembark from the chair. 
I have no idea if it was a new sound, or if maybe Norton and his team heard the same thing seventy years ago. 
But I do know that I had a bad case of the willies while I was standing there on the wall." Francesca was even pissed off at Brown at first. 
"It wasn't, of course," Janos continued. 
It's urgent." 
There was a knock on his door exactly three minutes later. Nicole greeted him and entered the room. 
She was carrying a data cube. 
Perhaps the valve has sprung a new leak. 
She thanked him with her eyes, "I very much appreciate what you did for me before launch," he continued. "If you feel compelled to limit my activities now, I will not object." 
Look at this. 
She moved toward the door. 
"You could help. 
Oh, darn," Richard said dramatically. "Business. 
She turned around to face him. 
And what be your name, fair lady?" TB said. 
The robot appeared to be staring at her. "You look more like a child of Othello and Desdemona." 
You said you had some business to discuss." But you've already used my two minutes," she said with a twinkle in her eye. "Are you certain that you won't die of starvation if I take five more minutes of your time?" 
Now you've aroused my curiosity. 
Richard opened the door and followed Nicole into the corridor. "Thanks for your help," Nicole said. "I appreciate it very much." Thank me after I do something," Richard said with a grin. 
Franceses had divided it into partitions, representing hours, and was now busy writing down whatever he told her, "The damn mission planning software is too inflexible to be useful in a situation like this," Dr. Brown was saying to Janos Tabori and Richard Wakefield. "It's only good when the sequence of activities being planned is consistent with one of the preflight strategies." 
A consensus decision was reached in half an hour. 
Nicole would stay onboard the Newton again, at least until the infrastructure was completed, and represent the cadets in the mission planning process, Admiral Heilmann would go into Rama with the four other professional cosmonauts. 
Next the lights go on and off unexpectedly." 
Wilson looked around the room at the rest of the crew. 
"And what do we all do? 
They don't want us in there. 
We haven't got a chance." 
It had a low, flat body, about twice as long as it was wide. Its weight was supported on six triplejointed legs. 
Although Reggie's behavior was definitely aberrant, there was enough sense in what he was saying to remind each of them of the dangers in their expedition. 
O'Toole staked out his position early. 
Richard Wakefield articulated a point of view that was apparently shared by several of the other crew members. 
She didn't say much herself, but she found her own opinions crystallizing as she followed the flow of the conversation. 
Toward the end of the discussion, however, she offered several personal, candid comments of her own. Her philosophical view of the Newton mission was altogether different from that expressed by O'Toole and Wakefield. 
May I read from the summary?" 
The diminutive Japanese scientist was borrowing a page from Brown's own portfolio. 
Sortie number two is designed to complete the mapping of the inside of Rama, focusing particularly on regions unexplored seventy years ago, as well as the collections of buildings called cities and any interior differences identified on the first sortie. 
Look at these amazing creatures,' he said, filling the center screen with a film of the six crab biots moving slowly across a bland region in the Southern Hemicylinder. 
"They look as if they could be quite formidable." 
If he doesn't, we will submit the issue to a vote of the crew." 
The meeting broke up slowly. 
The helicopter veered sharply to the left and flew over the side of the fivehundredmeter cliff that separated the southern half of Rama from the Cylindrical Sea. The bank here was ten times higher above the water than its northern counterpart. 
The other five crabs followed their leader, executing their turns row by row with military precision. 
From above, the whole region looked like a suburban yard in which part of the grass had been mowedon one side the ground was neat and packed, while in the territory not yet covered by the biots there was no orderly pattern in the soil markings. 
At length Brown spoke into the communicator. "What do you think, Dr. Takagishi? Is there anything else we should do at this time?" 
I can't imagine what we might learn that would materially alter our plans." 
But that was made by nature and took over a billion years, she said to herself. 
Nicole enjoyed being suspended on the chairlift. 
The amazing scene around her was temporarily almost static and she could study at her leisure any feature that was particularly interesting. 
After one more stop for Wilson to disembark, Nicole was at last approaching the bottom of the Alpha chairlift herself. 
It will never come to a complete stop," he was saying, "but it will slow down a lot. 
He grabbed her by the waist and lifted her off the platform. Takagishi and Wilson were already in the backseat of the rover. 
"Well, how does it feel to be part of the second team?" 
They'd like to leave you on the Newton permanently. 
I know it. 
It's just possible," Takagishi said softly, "that Dr. Brown is wrong." 
The blip representing the crabs would move in one direction for slightly more than ten minutes and then reverse itself. 
Hiss," shouted Wakefield. Janos laughed. 
Dr. David Brown pushed his chair back from the table. "Are you finished with your game, Tabori?" he asked. 
"I think it was Oh, here it is," Nicole said. 
Dr. Brown looked away. 
I will try to relax and get plenty of sleep. 
"I was, of course, very concerned to learn about his blood pressuredon't worry, he and I have already agreed that I won't use itbut what really bothered me was he reminded me that we never told you about the sleeping pill. 
I refused at first, but finally, after he kept badgering me, I gave him some nubitrol." 
Fifty meters farther from the cliff, in the neighborhood of a hut that was serving as a temporary headquarters, the rest of the cosmonauts were preparing for the hunt to begin. Irina Turgenyev was checking the installation of the cable snare in the second helicopter. 
David Brown was by himself a few meters away from the hut, talking on the radio with Admiral Heilmann back at the Beta campsite. The two men were reviewing the details of the capture plan. 
Those poor bastard crabs don't have a chance." 
While you were complaining about the length of our last meeting, we were finishing the contingency plans." 
Break break," the voice of Otto Heilmann interrupted him. "News. Hot news. 
Dr, Takagishi and Tabori both agree with you. 
Thanks a million," Francesca shouted as she handed Nicole the camera and dashed off to the waiting helicopter. Well, well," said Reggie Wilson as Nicole approached the rover with the camera cradled in her hands. 
"It doesn't bother me to help others when I have nothing specific to do myself." 
For some reason she had not expected them to be so large or so strange looking. 
Nicole had not forgotten what they had done to that mound of metal. 
"Nicole, try to speed up to the lead biot and then fall back little by little, letting the camera pan across each of the ranks." 
Now 1 know why we brought an Olympic champion with us." 
However, on the third try it landed perfectly on the number four crab's back. 
Nicole was starting to sweat. 
Her camera was fixed on the right rear crab as Janos tightened the cables. Now!" he shouted. The snare, with the biot entrapped, began to rise off the ground. 
The metal net was completely shredded and the biot was freed in five seconds, 
Nicole was amazed by what she was seeing. 
The biots were locked and motionless. 
The line nexus will adhere to the shell of the crab and will wrap its thin cables tightly around the entire carapace. 
AH we saw the biots do was engage in some kind of selfdefense activity." 
Professor Brown," the eminent Japanese scholar tried one last rational appeal, "please look around you. 
He looked around at the others. 
"I say that's enough talk, Otto. 
Then the cosmonauts heard Admiral Heilmann's affirmative reply. 
But our objections were made to sound foolish and even cowardly. 
What are you really all about, Rama? Nicole asked herself for the umpteenth time. 
Her next question startled her. She had never verbalized it before. 
The ever polite Dr. Takagishi thanked Reggie Wilson for driving the rover. 
The helicopter strained as the biot mass dangled two or three meters off the ground. 
"Run to the side," Richard Wakefield screamed into the communicator, "they can only go in straight lines." 
Her original burst of adrenaline enabled her to extend the distance separating her from the crabs to ten meters. 
There was nothing anyone could do. 
Reggie Wilson's horrified shrieks echoed through the vastness of Rama as the biots chopped him apart exactly as if he were part of the rover. 
You are welcome to visit me any time," he said with a friendly smile. 
Dr. Takagishi was slightly embarrassed. 
He held it between his index finger and his thumb. "It's a netsuke heirloom from my wife's family," he said. "It's made from ivory." 
He handed the little man to Nicole. 
Mostly they shared memories of their families. 
Would you please go over to your hut and bring back your biometry equipment? 
"You were right, Nicole," he said, "that there were manual commands input to RoSur. And these commands did indeed shut down the normal fault protection algorithms. 
Manual commands were essentially considered to be emergencies by the overall system design. 
But why," Tabori asked, "did it go back to the first command afterward?" 
The internal question the software asks after finishing with the processing of each command is whether or not there is another manual command in the buffer. 
If there is not, then the software rejects the first command and is free to handle another interrupt. 
If there is, however, the software is told to store the rejected command and process the next command. 
The explanation was clear enough, and she had certainly not wanted the analysis to implicate Janos or any other member of the crew. 
He smiled. 
David Brown, Otto Heilmann, and Francesca Sabatini were arguing about how to reply to the latest directions from Earth. 
But they have ordered us to return to the Newton as soon as possible,' Admiral Heilmann protested. 
She wasn't anxious to answer Dr. Brown's questions about Takagishi's heart condition anyway. 
She walked slowly back to her hut. 
Good night, Otto," David Brown said as the German admiral left his hut. 
"David," she said, "we have more problems." 
Borzov would be on the Newton today, recovering from his appendectomy, and you and I would be here leading the exploration of Rama." 
David Brown removed his hands from hers and started to wring them. "I feel so ... so unclean," he said. 
We could be indicted." 
"What has happened to me? 
Your integrity was compromised a long long time ago." 
That's unfair," Dr. Brown said petulantly. 
We face ourselves as we are, not as we would like to be." 
She returned to the cot and took David's hands in hers again. 
She stood up in front of David, forcing him to open his eyes. 
She switched on her small flashlight and walked away in a southerly direction, toward the Cylindrical Sea. 
For several minutes Francesca flipped through her entire memory bank on Nicole, attempting to find any personality or character flaw that could be exploited. 
Maybe, she thought, if I knew the answer to that question ... 
By this time the lights from the campsite behind her were barely visible. 
It began right after my eleventh birthday, she thought, plunging back into the details of her life eighteen years before. / had no idea what the bastard wanted at first She took another deep drag from her cigarette. 
Automobiles had been banned from upper Orvieto, except by special permit, for almost a hundred years, so Francesca knew the man must be an unusual individual. 
Men have always believed that they were created perfect; it is women who have taught them to sin." 
Francesca gave him her prettiest smile. 
"Did you know," she continued, "that Michelangelo came here to study Signorelli's nudes before he painted the ceiling at the Sistine Chapel?" 
As they went down a narrow alley, she leaned over and playfully bit his ear. He spontaneously pulled her to him and was rewarded with an explosive kiss. 
The surge in his loins overwhelmed him. 
So we went to Rome and then Capri, Francesca remembered. Paris for a week. In Milano you had me live with Monica and Luigi. 
Her ears told her the sound was out on the ice. 
She listened again very carefully, but heard nothing. 
He could not see lights in any of the other huts. 
He took a deep breath and tiptoed out the door. 
Takagishi sat on the bottom rung, hidden against the base of the cliff. He removed some special cleats from his bag and attached them to the bottom of his shoes. 
When he was a hundred meters from the shore, the Japanese scientist took a larger flashlight from his bag and switched on its powerful beam. 
At the center of each of the three main sections was a central core, or plaza, around which the rest of the buildings and streets were arranged. 
Shigeru Takagishi moved deliberately around the entire perimeter of the circle, studying the surrounding buildings as he walked. 
He deployed the scientific apparatus in the plaza, three or four meters away from the octahedron, and then spent ten minutes verifying with his transceiver that all the scientific instruments were properly working. 
Takagishi moved stealthily across the two avenues and started around the octahedron in the direction of the noise. 
The beam reflected off a small piece of metal some thirty to forty meters closer to the center of the plaza. Takagishi realized immediately that the reflection was coming from the instrument package. 
Again he fought the urge to run away. 
Admiral, do you remember that hypothetical discussion we had with General Borzov during the cruise, about the conditions under which we would activate Trinity?" 
He's here already. 
Oh, well, only every time l see you. 
Beg forgiveness and then you pay. 
You know who you are and you know kind of all about yourself. 
Sammy Jankis had the same problem but he really had no system. 
What can l do for you, Leonard? 
OK. lf he calls or shows up here, give me a call in my room, OK? 
Where you put them is really important. 
You did explain, Lenny. 
Yeah, it's tough. lt's almost impossible. 
Are you sure you want this? 
Remember Sammy Jankis. l met Sammy through work. lnsurance. l was an investigator. l'd investigate the claims to see which ones were phoney. l had to see through people's bullshit. lt was useful experience cos now it's my life. 
People get nervous for all sorts of reasons. lt's all about context. 
They're an interpretation, not a record. 
You're living. 
How you doing, Leonard? 
Can't work, can't do shit. 
They were short. 
Sorry. 
Guess l don't have to worry about him any more. 
Oh, and l just take your word? 
Maybe it's... for when l find him. l've lost somebody too. l'm sorry. 
How can l heal? 
She has also lost someone. 
But l'll take a look anyway. 
Nothing except the Gideon Bi... 
You don't know him? 
For Christ sakes! 
This is not my room. lt must be his room. 
Nothing. 
Put him onto Teddy orjust get rid of him for Natalie. 
Teddy, Teddy. (dialling tone) (ringing) Yeah, leave your number, you know what to do. (beep) Yeah. 
Was l supposed to lock the door? (softly) No. l'd like you to leave now. (clicks off alarm) There's something about the drugs stashed in the car that doesn't ring true. 
Well, l think John G left it there. 
Yeah, first l just need you to put these things around the room. Pretend they're your things and this is your bedroom. 
How she treated him. 
You know all about Sammy and you've decided he's faking. 
We shouldn't be talking like this while the case is still open to appeal. l'm not appealing the decision. 
You're still here because of Natalie. 
She takes orders for him, arranges meets. 
Somebody's got to pay, Lenny. 
Do not trust her. 
There. 
Oh! So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership? 
You wander around playing detective. 
Dodd beat the shit out of me. 
Jimmy's partners think l set him up. l don't know if you know this Teddy. 
Exactly what happened. l'm gonna write down what happened. 
Thanks. 
Somebody's come already. (phone rings) (phone rings) (ringing stops) (phone rings) On the house. 
Why are you calling me? 
Everything just fades. 
Just that his condition was mental, not physical. l found out later that she went home and gave Sammy his final exam. 
She wasn't interested in the money. 
What are you still doing here, Lenny? 
There's plenty of tattoo parlours up north. l guess l wanted to get something down before it slipped my mind. 
You're full of shit. 
So take these clothes, put them on and get the fuck out of here. 
Why? l'm undercover. 
Do you remember me? 
Motherfuck! 
Why? l don't wanna get blood on them. 
Well, l don't know. 
Amphetamines l told him l had. ls this a drug deal? 
How did he know me? 
So you lie to yourself to be happy. 
The torment and pain and anguish tearing her up inside. 
Sammy was a con man. 
That's right. 
Don't lie to me any more. 
The guy that cracked your skull and fucked your wife. 
Fuck you. l gave you a reason to live and you were more than happy to help. 
You think ljust want another puzzle to solve? 
Will you help me find the keys? 
Old Sparky's clients came to a knowledge of their deaths from the ankles up. 
He told her to discard her slavename and to die under her free name, Matuomi. 
At the bottom was the restraint room. 
At the execution of Elmer Manfredin July or August of '30, that one was, I believewe had nine witnesses pass out. 
On the left side of the storage shedagainthere was life. 
John Coffey was black, like most of the men who came to stay for awhile in E Block before dying in Old Sparky's lap, and he stood six feet, eight inches tall. 
They'd put him in the biggest denims they could find in Stores, and still the cuffs of the pants rode halfway up on his bunched and scarred calves. 
He looked like he could have snapped the chains that held him as easily as you might snap the ribbons on a Christmas present, but when you looked in his face, you knew he wasn't going to do anything like that. 
It was real: six feet, eight inches. 
Hot work, heavy lifting. 
He would sit down with Old Sparky in a little while, and Old Sparky would make an end to him ... but whatever it was that had done that awful thing was already gone, and now he lay on his bunk, letting his little companion run squeaking over his hands. 
It was like his headshake: down , up, back to center. 
Still with me?" 
I believe I've seen the back end of him," he said. 
But a man with a wife, children, or friends to look forward to on Sunday afternoons was easier to control, if control looked to be a problem. 
"Because I get a little scared in the dark sometimes," he said. 
They did touch you, you know; you didn't see them at their worst, hammering out their horrors like demons at a forge. 
Yes, it's pretty bright in here all night long," I said. 
It made Harry Terwilliger blink, I can tell you that. 
I don't expect it," I said, and I didn't ... but I had hopes. 
And the auto shop never happened, anywaythe next spring, the prison moved sixty miles down the road to Brighton. 
The library was Lshaped, and not much bigger than my office. 
It must have been a hundred degrees in there, and I could feel that hot throb in my groin when I sat down. 
The heat wasn't bothering him, nor were the grunts, thumps, and occasional curses from the infirmary upstairs (where it had to be at least ten degrees hotter, and I hoped Percy Wetmore was enjoying it). 
The thought of those little nineyearold girlstheir fluffy heads of blonde hair and their engaging Bobbsey Twins smilesin connection with Coffey's hulking darkness was unpleasant but impossible to ignore. 
Not that night, not ever again. 
She started the coffee, then put bacon on to fry. 
Except no breakfast was eaten in the Detterick house that morning. 
One look, and she understood why Howie had been white. 
She screamed for Klausshrieked for himand Klaus came on the dead run, his workboots whitened by the halffull pail of milk he had spilled on them. 
At last she managed, "Yes, ma'am. 
Mrs. Detterick, I sure am, oh dear sweet blessed Jesus, I'm aprayin right now that your little girls are all right!' 
On the other side of the alders there was more open ground stretching back to the woods on the right. 
Curled in each arm was the body of a naked girl. 
It was Klaus Detterick who broke the tableau. 
His workboot, caked with spilled milk that had already soured in the heat, scored a direct hit on Coffey's left temple, but Coffey seemed not to feel it at all. 
It took four men to haul the hysterical farmer off John Coffey, and he fetched Coffey I don't know how many good licks before they finally did. 
Still he curled his arms around his unspeakable dolls, their chins down on their chests so their faces could not be clearly seen, one of the few mercies God saw fit to bestow that day. 
"And where did the likes of you get a little lunch, John Coffey?" 
Bad thinking could cause mistakes, maybe more bloodshed. 
Wellsir, I don't exactly remember, be dog if I do," Coffey said in his tearchoked voice, "but it's a little lunch, all right, sammidges and I think a swee' pickle." 
There was also a pickle, wrapped in its own piece of a funny page John Coffey would never be able to puzzle out. 
The lunch, wrapped up again and tied for good measure, finally ended up with Bobo Marchant, who put it in his knapsack, where he kept treats for his dogs (and a few fishing lures, I shouldn't wonder). 
"You want to tell me that?" 
Boy, you are under arrest for murder," McGee said, and then he spit in John Coffey's face. 
The jury was out fortyfive minutes. 
I think you know I didn't find all that out during one hot October afternoon in the soontobedefunct prison library, from one set of old newspapers stacked in a pair of Pomona orange crates, but I learned enough to make it hard for me to sleep that night. 
I finished my butt, went into the bedroom, and finally got to sleep. I dreamed of girls with shy smiles and blood in their hair. 
I've always thought this "getitoverwith" business was overrated. 
Delacroix had wept briefly after turning inhe did most nights, and more for himself than for the folks he had roasted alive, I am quite sureand then had take Mr. Jingles, the mouse, out of the cigar box he slept in. 
That had calmed Del, and he had slept like a baby the rest of the night. 
I worked for three wardens during my years as a Cold Mountain guard; Hal Moores was the last and best of them. 
Not so well at all." 
"Don't wait. 
This was '32, remember, when even something as relatively simple as a urinary infection was either sulfa and stink or suffer and wait. I thank you for your concern, Paul. 
Now let's talk about Percy Wetmore!' I groaned and covered my eyes. 
Just like the schoolroom sissy telling teacher he saw Jack and Jill smooching in the cloakroom." 
Yes, but" And you know how he runs it along the bars sometimes, just for the pure hell of it. 
The temperatures outside were unseasonable, and the infection crawling around inside me had turned the thermostat up even more. 
And when a man's in that kind of situation, why, sometimes his fist flies out pretty much of its own accord. 
What's this kid doing? 
I looked at him with my jaw hung. 
Good," he said, and stood up himself. 
Seems a little better." Well, that's fine." He saw me to the door. 
Don't worry about that!" 
I was happy to go. 
Delacroix's mouse was one of God's mysteries. 
Delacroix claimed that he trained that mouse, which started its life among us as Steamboat Willy, but I really think it was the other way around. 
Basically, we wanted to know just one thing: were they pleased with the service? 
You see it foamin at the mouth, Mouse Man?" 
There was no broom by the duty desk, but there was a rolling mopbucket with the mop still in the wringer; I'd taken my turn at swabbing the green lino and all six of the cells shortly before sitting down to the recordbox with Dean. 
Aw, Brutal, no!" Dean exclaimed, then looked at me. 
The truth was, I kind of wanted to see what he'd do, too. 
Brutal reached into the desk drawer above the kneehole and brought out the big leatherbound book with the word VISITORS stamped on the front in gold leaf. 
Regulation 19 stated simply: Each visitor to E Block shall show a yellow Administration pass and shall be recorded without fail" He's gone nuts," Dean said to me. 
It was because of that first talkie cartoon, where he rolled his eyes and bumped his hips around and pulled the whistle cord in the pilothouse of the steamboat. There," Brutal said, slamming the book closed and returning it to its drawer, "all done and buttoned up." 
He hesitated and added, "The wrong someone." 
He hesitated again, looking nearsightedly around almost as if he expected to see that the walls had grown ears, before finishing: "Someone like Percy KissMyAssandGotoHeaven Wetmore." 
I guess we ought to," I said. 
"No hole, no crack ... there's that, but" He pointed to the drain in the floor. 
I don't know," I said. 
Cursing at the top of his voice, Percy unlocked the door and hauled all that shit out again. 
There was a shelf jutting out from the back of the ladder near the top, the sort of thing a workman would use to hold his toolkit or a painter the bucket he was working out of. 
There was a flashlight on it. 
You're shorter than me, so you'll have to go pretty near all the way, but I'll hold your legs!" 
Look to your left, where those two beams come together. 
I did, and saw what he wanted me to see almost right away. 
It was a small mouse," I said, "but that small? 
Don't let nothing happen to Mr. Jingles, I could hear Delacroix saying in a voice that wouldn't stay steady I could hear that, and I could feel the warmth of Mr. Jingles as the Frenchman handed it to me, just a mouse, smarter than most of the species, no doubt, but still just a mouse for a' that and a' that. 
Something back inside that hole. 
I took a pen out of my breast pocket with my right hand, still holding onto the beam with my left, not worried anymore about Brutal inadvertently tickling my sensitive knees. 
It was a tiny splinter of wood which had been tinted a bright yellow, and I heard Delacroix's voice again, so clearly this time that his ghost might have been lurking in that room with usthe one where William Wharton spent so much of his time. 
Christ," I whispered. 
You found another one, didn't you?" Brutal asked. 
As for what Brutal and I agreed on that night in the restraint room, it turned out just that way It was almost as if we had taken a solemn oath on those tiny bits of colored, wood. Neither of us ever took part in another execution. 
Brad Dolan, his name is. 
"You're just lucky you don't have that Alzheimer's disease, Paulie," was what he said. 
There's a great lot of them, and I think there's apt to be a great lot more before I am through. 
The President was awake this time, standing at his cell door. 
Percy kind of sneered at that, but for the time being said nothing. 
The mouse stopped where it had before, no more than three feet from the duty desk, looking up at Dean like a prisoner before the bar. 
Looks more like a nigger eating watermelon to me. ". Percy remarked, but neither guard paid him any mind. 
The mouse sniffed but did not touch. 
Percy wanted not just to kill the mouse but to squash it, so he ran in big, comical leaps, like a deer, stamping down with his heavy black workshoes. 
Percy gave him an ugly look and flicked his hair off his brow. 
Percy's chest expanded at that. 
And we don't scare them any more than we have to, because they're under a lot of strain," Dean said. 
It's best to be quiet!" 
What Dean said to me on that subject when he told me this story the following night has stuck with me ever since, because it turned out to be a kind of prophecy. 
You don't know the half of it," Dean said. 
The mouse was back the very next evening, which just happened to be the first of Percy Wetmore's two nights off before he slid over to the graveyard shift. 
I was there to see his reappearance; so was Dean. 
Harry was on the desk. 
The water was so pure and so cold that it felt like your mouth was cut every time you drank. 
I always listened carefully when the subject was Percy, because I agreed with Dean a hundred per centI thought Percy was the sort of man who could cause a lot of trouble, as much for the rest of us as for himself. 
I tell you, it was exactly as if the damned thing knew it had been called. 
He reached into his breast pocket and came out with a slice of cinnamon apple wrapped in waxed paper. 
He broke off the end and tossed it on the floor. 
What do you mean?" TootToot asked. 
I'm not going to talk about this," Harry said. He sounded as if he was halfjoking, halfnot. 
He only ate from you fellas," TootToot said. 
Visiting hours for most Cold Mountain prisoners were as rigid as steel beams, but that didn't hold for our boys on E Block. 
Not me, though. 
The crown of The Chief's head would be shaved tomorrow night, and Dean's check then would be to make sure he didn't need a touchup. 
Stubble could impede conduction, make things harder. 
At the head of the corridor we turned right, away from life as it was lived in the exercise yard and toward death as it was died in the storage room. 
That had also been emptied for our use. 
He's fast, and he doesn't get them all worked up. 
Bitterbuck would cross to the platform on an angle that would keep him safely away from the seated spectators, and half a dozen guards would be added for insurance. 
Or writhing on the floor with his balls swelling up to the size of Mason jars, for that matter, while forty or so spectatorsmany of them gentlemen of the presssit in those Grangehall chairs, watching the whole thing. 
We clamped TootToot's ankles. 
Toot gave me a grin as if to say that was a good 'un, Boss Edgecombe, a real good 'un. 
Shit," I said, "I'm getting too old for this job." 
But I wasn't, neither was he, not as far as this goddam job went, and both of us knew it. 
Not today, though; there was no need to get Toot's old head wet. 
Old Toot, perhaps trying to recapture his earlier flare of comic genius, began to buck and flail in the chair, as Old Sparky's actual customers almost never did. 
I'm a done tom turkey!" 
Harry and Dean, I saw, were not watching this at all. 
The execution went wellif there was ever such a thing as "a good one" (a proposition I strongly doubt), then the execution of Arlen Bitterbuck, council elder of the Washita Cherokee, was it. 
Over against the wall, the prison doctor watched expressionlessly, lips thinned until his mouth looked like a single white stitch. 
The doctor stepped forward from his place and listened with his stethoscope. 
Van Hay rolled on three and The Chief surged forward again, twisting a little from side to side in the grip of the current. 
That one braid was pretty well charred, and I was sorry to see that the cunning little bow on that side of his head was now nothing but a blackened lump. 
"Hope hell's hot enough for you." 
But instead of grabbing at Percy, Brutal grabbed hold of the gurney and began pushing Arlen Bitterbuck slowly toward the far end of the tunnel, where his last ride was waiting, parked on the soft shoulder of the highway. 
I was deeply in love, you see, with the young woman who was to become my wife two weeks after my nineteenth birthday. 
I didn't stop, and when a voice in my head clamored that it would be madness to mail such a letter, that I would be giving her my naked heart to hold in her hand, I ignored it with a child's breathless disregard of the consequences. 
If I'd known the story was going to go on this long, I might never have started. 
They had to ID him by his fingerprints. 
On the whole, he might have been better off with Old Sparky ... but then he never would have had those extra twelve years, would he? 
They never caught whoever did for him. 
Which actually meant just me and Brutal, because Percy kept pretty much to himself. 
But all good things come to an end, and on a rainy Monday in late Julyhave I told you how rainy and dank that summer was? 
I found myself sitting on the bunk of an open cell and waiting for Eduard Delacroix. 
For Chrissakes! 
Come on, you fuckin Frenchfried faggot!" Percy yelled, ignoring Brutal completely. 
And here he came, dragging a guy not much bigger than a bowling pin by one arm. 
Yet he did not look entirely unhappy. Delacroix was trying to keep up with him, but he had the legirons on, and no matter how fast he shuffled his feet, Percy pulled him along faster. 
Don't let him hit me no mo, m'sieu," Delacroix babbled. "S'il vous plait, s'il vous plait!" Let me at im, let me at im!" Percy cried, lunging forward. 
What's it all about, anyway?" I was trying to get my body in between Delacroix's and Percy's, but it wasn't working very well. 
Percy's club continued to flail away, now on one side of me and now on the other. 
Whap! Whap! And now Delacroix was bleeding from one ear and screaming. 
I couldn't imagine the most predatory homosexual on God's green earth doing what Percy had just described. 
Then I turned to Percy "Get out of here," I said. 
I saw Brutal looking at me disapprovingly, but ignored it. "Go on, get out of here. 
You don't scare me, you know," Percy said. 
Christ almighty Jesus," he said, putting the pencil down. 
Brutal snorted. 
He put his hands out same as anyone would when they start to fall, and one of them brushed the front of Percy's pants. 
Showing him who bosses the shooting match around here?" 
"God, I hate this. 
And you want to know something else, Paul? 
I shook my head. 
Look, Cap'n" he said when he saw me. "I done tame me a mouse!" 
Watch dis!" Delacroix said. 
Boss Howell named him." 
Not serenityI don't think Percy Wetmore had a serene bone in his bodybut the look of a man who has discovered he can wait for the things he wants. 
Probably it was just smelling the little Frenchman's fear, and reacting off that. 
He sat perfectly still with his back feet in Delacroix's hair and his front ones splayed on Delacroix's bald looking at Percy, seeming to size him up. 
It was the truth then, and for awhile after, but I found out in time. 
What had griped Percy the most was me telling him to get out of my sight. 
Well, Moores told me, he had stood Percy off for as long as he could, and when it became dear to him that Percy was going to try pulling some strings to get me reprimanded and moved to another part of the prison at the very least, he, Moores, had pulled Percy into his office and told him that if he quit rocking the boat, Moores would make sure that Percy was out front for Delacroix's execution. 
It's amazing how some men can change, given the right incentive; in Percy's case, all Warden Moores had to offer was the chance to take a bald little Frenchman's life. 
He's gonna walk the Mile in a month, six weeks at the very outside. 
"Who gonna buy a cigar box some mouse been using for a toilet?" 
I had never seen a mere mouse attend to something with such sharpnesswith such intelligence. I don't really believe that Mr. Jingles was a supernatural visitation, and if I have given you that idea, I'm sorry, but I have never doubted that he was a genius of his kind. Delacroix bent over and rolled the threadless spool across the floor of his cell. 
The mouse was out of his box in a flash and across the floor after it, like a dog chasing after a stick. 
Come and see what Mr. Jingles can do! 
I suppose he was completely happy, maybe for the first time in his whole miserable life. 
That wasn't exactly it, but it gives you an idea of that stewpot French of his. 
It was a matter of two days, I think, from the twentyseventh of October to the twentyfifth. Don't hold me to it exactly, but I know that's close; I remember thinking that Toot was going to get his Corona box back even sooner than he had expected. 
His eyes were raw, the skin beneath them puffy and swollen. 
His voice was low, rasping, almost a bark, and there were blackishpurple bruises rising on his neck. 
You were cruising along, everything going according to Hoyle, you made one mistake, and bang, the sky fell down on you. 
Sometimes you also discovered a yellow streak in them, once their backs were to the wall, but more often there was nothing there but fight and mean and then more fight and more mean. There are people who see nobility in folks like Billy Wharton, but I am not one of them. 
Every now and then he hummed a little, Harry said, and Percy roused himself enough from his funk to say that the lugoon dripped spittle from his lax lower lip, a drop at a time, until it had made a puddle between his feet. 
Pumpkin time, it would have been. 
As for me, I was sitting in what would be Wharton's home until it came time for him to check into the hot placefirst cell on the right as you headed down the corridor toward the restraint room. 
From over Dean's shoulder, one blazing blue eye dared me to shoot. 
We spend a lot of time together, Elaine and I. If I hadn't reached such a grotesque age, I suppose I might speak of her as my ladyfriend. 
It's strange, but it's true. 
'Crazywild and proud of it. Wharton is nineteen years old, and he just doesn't care.' 
The hand which had gone around my shoulders was now rubbing my back. 
It used to make me prickle all over when Janice did that, and it still made me prickle all over when Elaine did it early this morning. 
I was starting to shiver again in spite of my best efforts. 
What's a few sleepless nights at our age? 
I thought about Warden Moores, and Harry Terwilliger, and Brutus Howell; I thought about MY mother, and about Jan, my wife, who died in Alabama. 
Because it was him." 
Because she might have said yes, and she would only have said that for me. Not so good. 
And then, filling the open doorway to the prison yard, a miracle in the flesh: Brutus Howell. They had finished moving the last of the infirmary equipment, and he had come over to see who wanted coffee. 
There was a dull whock! 
I missed my chance to make like James Cagney in White Heat. 
What happen, boss?" Delacroix asked. "Who been hurt?" 
It ain't over yet," Delacroix said, looking up the Mile toward the cell where Wharton was jugged. "L'homme mauvais, c'est" Well," I said, "don't let it get you down, Del. 
So talk, John Coffey," I said, trying to keep my voice light and calm. 
Stop, I said to myself, you just stop now, Paul. 
I used one key on the top lock, another on the bottom lock, and then I slid the door back on its track. 
You know, boss, that maybe not such a good idear," Delacroix said in a voice so nervous and prissy it would probably have made me laugh under other circumstances. 
I sat down there next to him, and he put his arm around my shoulders, as if we were at the movies and I was his girl. 
I could see every pore on john Coffey's face, I could see every bloodshot snap in his haunted eyes, I could see a tiny healing scrape on his chin. 
I could still feel the sweat it had drawn out of my skin, and I could smell it, but it was gone, all right. 
Then his teeth parted, too, and he exhaled a cloud of tiny black insects that looked like gnats or noseeums. 
They swirled furiously between his knees, turned white, and disappeared. 
I remember thinking the name of the SaviorChrist, Christ, Christ, over and over, like thatand I remember thinking that the fever had driven me delirious. 
There was a moment of dizziness, but that passed even before I was able to reach out and grab the bars of Coffey's cell door for balance. 
"What did you do to me?" 
"I helped it, didn't I?" 
He th'ow some grisgris on you?" 
Delacroix reached up and took the mouse in one hand. 
Then it took the offered piece of candy and began to munch it. Delacroix looked at it a moment longer, then looked at me. 
"Have you a little rest. 
I sat there, feeling the nothing in my groin where a forest fire had been blazing not ten minutes before. I helped it, didn't I? 
I didn't believe all of them, but there were plenty of people I did believe. 
What did God want of me, in this case? 
No one was apt to question my looking and sounding better; I'd been telling the world I was getting better, and until that very day I'd honestly believed it. 
After what had happened to me there in his cell, I was more curious than ever. 
She didn't ask my business, just led me through a small house fragrant with the smell of baking and onto the back porch, where her husband sat with a bottle of pop in his hand and an unopened copy of Liberty magazine on his lap. 
And thank you. 
A cold drink would be wonderful, ma'am." 
He never took his eyes off the kids down at the bottom of the yard. 
He gave me a sharp, dry look. 
I just wanted to make sure of you." 
I sent him a picture of Coffey and he said that was the man. 
All right," she said, and drew her head back inside. 
He saw my reaction and laughed. 
But they didn't manage to whop the devil out of him, did they, Edgecombe? 
I know how he was found, and it's hard to jibe that with what I see, day in and day out, on the block. 
Then he leaned back in his chair again and looked at me. 
It is of no particular use, but you keep it around because you think it loves you. 
He knew he was ugly. 
A huge, circular scar ran out of his hair, down his forehead, through one dead and indifferently cocked eye, and to the comer of his mouth, which had been disfigured into the knowing leer of a gambler or perhaps a whoremaster. 
Hammersmith took a handkerchief from his back pocket and wiped at his eyes with itthey were dry, but I suppose he'd gotten used to them being wet. 
"He played with them; used to lick Arden's face until she giggled. Caleb used to pull his ears, and when he was first learning to walk, he'd sometimes go around the yard, holding to Galahad's tail. 
But I didn't concern myself with that, you know. 
You want to know if he did it, your weepy Mr. Coffey with the scars all over him?" 
Don't you doubt it, and don't you turn your back on him. 
But you'll fix him, won't you, Edgecombe? 
Don't mention it," he said. 
It was a long drive, and this time I wasn't able to shorten it by singing songs. 
The dirty sonofabitch must have been saving it up all day," Harry said later, still disgusted and outraged. 
It wasn't a bad way to run things, all and all, and I felt that, once I could shift Percy over to days, life would be even better. 
"Come on, you ugly motherfucker," he said. 
Wharton jumped forward, and Brutal hit him a good smart lickthe kind of lick I'm sure Percy dreamed ofacross his forehead, laying his baton right over Wharton's eyebrows. 
Pretty soon you'll be history yourself, Wild Bill. 
I caught him and pushed him to Harry. And Harry propelled him on down the Green Mile, past the gleeful Delacroix and the impassive Coffey. Wharton ran to keep from falling on his face, spitting curses the whole way. 
"All ready," Harry said. 
"Come on, Wild Billy. And look on the good side. 
He suddenly collapsed, half of him in the cell, half of him on the playedout lino of the Green Mile, kicking his feet and bucking his body. 
Carrying his jerking body, listening to him grunt from one end and fart from the other was one of my life's less pleasant experiences. 
There was nothing he did that hadn't been tried before (well, except for the thing with the moonpie, maybe; even Brutal admitted that was pretty original), but his sheer persistence was scary. 
And the situation might continue for quite awhile, because somewhere he had a lawyer who was beating the bushes, telling folks how wrong it would be to kill this fellow upon whose brow the dew of youth had not yet dried and who was, incidentally, as white as old Jeff Davis. 
That was the week Melinda Moores, the warden's wife, came home from Indianola. 
The doctors were done with her; they had their interesting, newfangled Xray photographs of the tumor in her head; they had documented the weakness in her hand and the paralyzing pains that racked her almost constantly by then, and were done with her. 
"He's gonna be good, ain't you, Del? 
Percy and I were standing up by the duty desk, watching this, Percy with his arms folded and a small, contemptuous smile on his lips. 
What dis about, you gran' 'fou?" Del asked querulously, drawing his feet up on the bunk as Brutal undid the double locks on his cell door and ran it open. 
One of them, I believe, is a politician all the way from the state capital." 
"Got other fish to fry. 
But Delacroix had no way of knowing any of that. 
Harry and Dean stopped in front of the empty cell across from Wharton's (that worthy had still not so much as stirred). 
He spoke in an indulgent, proprietary way that didn't sound like the old Percy at all. 
He jerked away with an expression of fear and dismay, and tripped over one of Brutal's big feet. 
What broke it was cackling laughter, so sudden and so completely its own mad thing that it was shocking. 
And, given Percy's last namean unfortunate one, in this contextit was a story that would have been told with the relish of high glee for years to come. 
I think he saw that pity, and it made it worse with himlike having an open wound scoured with nettles. 
I tell you what, though," he said, "I don't like this weather much. 
Dat stuff gripe me like a motherfucker, I can't get off the toilet the nex' day, but I don't think I gonna have a problem this time, n'estce pas?" Most of them worry about their immortal souls with a kind of moronic ferocity, but Delacroix pretty much dismissed my questions about what he wanted for spiritual comfort in his last hours. 
I started to speak after all, then something made me look over my shoulder and out the cell door. 
And suppose the kid lost interest and forgot to feed him for two or three days at a stretch? 
Percy was there, too, and Brutal finally tired of trying to start a conversation with him and getting nothing but sullen grunts in response. 
Is that right, Paul? 
"It's a big success. 
And they can't be white mice, because those are petshop mice." 
You shittin me? 
And there's, like, this whole city made out of Bakelite boxes and toiletpaper rolls, with windows made out of isinglass so you can see what they're up to in there" Yeah! 
It was pretty funny. 
Mr. Jingles raced out after it, and Percy saw his chance. 
Then, with my belly full and with the damp air still perking up my brain (or so I hoped), I would go up to the solarium and write about the execution of Eduard Delacroix. 
He was wearing jeans and a cheesylooking Westernstyle shirt. 
I'm pretty sure of something else, as well: I'll have to watch out for Mr. Brad Dolan. 
I hate it when he calls me Paulie, and I think he knows it, but I was damned if I'd give him the satisfaction of seeing it. 
Those slickers're for the employees, not the residents." 
The more I listened to him, the more he sounded like Percy. 
What do you do down that path?" he asked. 
That made me think of a reporter who'd covered John Coffey's trial. The reporter was a terrible man named Hammersmith, and the most terrible thing about him was that he hadn't known he was terrible. 
It was nothing but the remains of my second piece of toast. 
I heard, all right, but wouldn't give him the satisfaction of saying so. I went in, passed through the kitchen (I could now smell eggs and sausage cooking, but no longer wanted any), and hung the poncho back up on its hook. 
Then I went upstairs to my roomresting at every step, giving my heart time to slowand gathered my writing materials together. 
"I've got more time than Carter's got liver pills. 
"That would be my honor." 
And why shouldn't we be allowed such an idea? 
Just as Mr. Jingles reached the spooltoo intent on it to realize his old enemy was at handPercy brought the sole of one hard black workshoe down on him. There was an audible snap as Mr. Jingles's back broke, and blood gushed from his mouth. 
He threw himself at the door of his cell and thrust his arms out through the bars, reaching as far as he could, crying the mouse's name over and over. 
But Mr. Jingles was the focusing point for those pentup feelings, and it was terrible to listen to him. 
Like Delacroix, he had put his arms through the bars of his cell door, but unlike Del, he wasn't waving them around. 
And his voice, had the same quality, which was why, I suppose, I didn't recognize it as belonging to Coffey at first. 
"What's going on?" Dean asked, but I only shook my head. 
Delacroix gathered him up, laughing and crying at the same time, covering the mouse with shameless, smacking kisses. Dean and Harry and Brutal watched with silent wonder. 
Then, very gently, he tossed the spool. 
It rolled across the cell, past the Corona cigar box, and to the wall. 
I realized that Percy looked older, somehow. 
My heart was thumping hard in my chest but I made my voice come out mild, almost disinterested. 
He sounded as if he was on the verge of laughter. 
He stalked past us, mouth set, small hands (Wharton was right, they were pretty) fiddling with his comb. 
I don't know about Brutal, but I couldn't think of a thing to say. 
I didn't even know how to think about what we had just seen. 
I turned him around, lifted him onto the platform, then backed him up until the backs of his knees struck the seat of the electric chair and he had to sit down. 
"That you'll put in for a transfer the very next day." 
About that even your offsides uncle the governor is going to care." 
Percy's eyes flicked back and forth mistrustfully between us. 
He said nothing, but I thought we almost had him. Come on, let's quit this," I said. 
Promise you'll leave after Del." He thought it over. 
If nothing else," Brutal said, "just think how nice it'd be to get away from that sack of pus Wharton." 
Good enough?" 
More fools us. 
The next day was the thickest yet, and the last of our strange October heat. 
At quarter past ten, Brother Schuster showed up and delighted us all by saying he would recite the Lord's Prayer with Del in Cajun French. 
"Here. Don't let nothing happen to Mr. Jingles." 
It was John Coffey's voice, and it was eerie the way it came right then, as though he had read my mind. 
"People pay a dime apiece to see him. 
You a good man, Boss Howell," Del said. 
Oui, monsieur," he said, and looked at Mr. Jingles, perched on John Coffey's broad shoulder, for the last time. "Au revoir, mon ami," he said, beginning to cry harder. "le t'aime, mon petit." 
It should have been funny, that blown kiss, or maybe just grotesque, but it wasn't. 
He nodded at me, then clapped Del on the shoulder. 
I glanced at the clock again and almost said somethingwould have, if Brutal hadn't twitched my sleeve and shaken his head. 
Come on, Del. Not far now." 
Fine, boss, dat fine. Because I ain't ascairt no more." 
"The only thing most of these people will remember about you is how you go out, so give them something good." 
“Sit down, Dasha,” Varvara Petrovna brought out with terrifying composure. 
“And it's the first time I've set eyes on you, my love, though I've been interested and wanted to know you a long time, for I see how wellbred you are in every movement you make,” Marya Timofyevna cried enthusiastically. 
“Can you make anything of it?” Varvara Petrovna asked with proud dignity. “I understand it....” 
I don't consider I have any right to inquire into them, if they are kept secret from me. 
And she wagged her head expressively. 
“We must put a stop to this,” Varvara Petrovna repeated, listening attentively to Marya Timofyevna. 
“That's impossible, Varvara Petrovna!” and Mavriky Nikolaevitch, who had sat all the time in unbroken silence, suddenly came forward in alarm. 
But what struck me most was the expression of Lizaveta Nikolaevna from the moment Darya Pavlovna had come in. 
Losing your temper too, of course, you spoke of certain anonymous letters. 
“Well, goodbye, Liza” (there was almost the sound of tears in Varvara Petrovna's voice), “believe that I shall never cease to love you whatever fate has in store for you. 
It appeared therefore that “the garb of love,” of which he had shouted to Shatov the day before, really did exist. 
All this, that is, the dresscoat and clean linen, had been procured by Liputin's advice with some mysterious object in view (as I found out later). 
“I have come, madam ...” he blared out like a trumpetblast. 
Varvara Petrovna waited, not taking her eyes off him. 
“Madam, madam!” He jumped up again, probably unconscious of doing so, and struck himself on the breast. 
“Ask another question.” 
You've never asked yourself such a question,” he said with pathetic irony. 
He was by now walking about the room again. 
When such a gentleman gets into” a circle in which he is not at home he usually begins timidly,but you have only to give him an inch and he will at once rush into impertinence. 
He walked about waving his arms and not listening to questions, talked about himself very, very quickly, so that sometimes his tongue would not obey him, and without finishing one phrase he passed to another. 
Shatov sat in the same position as before, but, what was strangest of all, Marya Timofyevna had not only ceased laughing, but had become terribly sad. 
You insist on an answer, why?” repeated the captain, winking. 
And is that justice, madam?” 
“That's allegory; besides, you express yourself too sensationally, sir, which I consider impertinence.” 
“No, it's not a fable of Krylov's I want to read. It's my fable, my own composition. 
“Lived a cockroach in the world Such was his condition, In a glass he chanced to fall Full of flyperdition.” 
In those portals now, madam, Lebyadkin may have spoken about an honourable young lady, in the honourable indignation of a soul revolted by wrongs, and his slanderers have taken advantage of it. 
He pressed him in his arms and the tears rolled down his cheeks. 
I knew you'd carry on. 
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was already in the room; he came in very quietly and stood still for an instant in the doorway, quietly scrutinising the company. 
But one thing struck me. In old days, though he had been considered handsome, his face was “like a mask,” as some of our sharptongued ladies had expressed it. 
I quite understand that no one has authorised me to tell the story, and I dare say I look ridiculous putting myself forward. 
Believe me, Varvara Petrovna, that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch is not at all to blame for not immediately answering your question just now with a full explanation, it's all a trivial affair. 
Kirillov, who was there (a very original man, Varvara Petrovna, and very abrupt, you'll see him perhaps one day, for he's here now), well, this Kirillov who, as a rule, is perfectly silent, suddenly got hot, and said to Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, I remember, that he treated the girl as though she were a marquise, and that that was doing for her altogether. 
“No, it was something higher than eccentricity, and I assure you, something sacred even! 
How sorry I am that you ... not that you're not a woman, but that you can't be one just for the moment so as to understand.” 
“I understand, I understand all that, Varvara Petrovna,” said Pyotr Stepanovitch, with a movement of some impatience. 
“You'll understand then the impulse which leads one in the blindness of generous feeling to take up a man who is unworthy of one in every respect, a man who utterly fails to understand one, who is ready to torture one at every opportunity and, in contradiction to everything, to exalt such a man into a sort of ideal, into a dream. 
When the first contemptible anonymous letter was sent to me, Pyotr Stepanovitch, you'll hardly believe it, but I had not strength enough to treat all this wickedness with contempt.... 
“It's a sacred duty I intend to carry out. 
Here he doesn't feed her properly, beats her, and bullies her. 
Mr. Lebyadkin, is that all true that I have said just now?” 
Drops of perspiration stood out on his forehead. 
But let me tell you I've hardly begun yet what I've got to say about your conduct, in its real sense. 
Varvara Petrovna understood that note, but her exaltation was not damped, quite the contrary. 
“I will explain everything to you, maman, of course, but now ...” 
And laughter again, Mavriky Nikolaevitch was tall, but by no means inexcusably so. 
“More than two hours,” answered Nicolas, looking at her intently. 
“I believe one may congratulate you ... or is it too soon?” he brought out with a peculiar line in his face. 
He turned quickly to her. 
“Well, you see, if there's anything I've not understood,” said Pyotr Stepanovitch, as though in alarm, talking more quickly than ever, “it's his fault, of course, for writing like that. 
Am I such a merciless creditor? 
“Please, Stepan Trofimovitch, for God's sake, don't say anything,” she began, speaking with haste and excitement, with a look of pain in her face, hurriedly stretching out her hands to him. 
Darya Pavlovna, please forgive me! ... 
When Shatov stood still facing him with his eyes fixed on him, and without uttering a word, every one suddenly noticed it and there was a general hush; Pyotr Stepanovitch was the last to cease speaking. 
It was not a slap with the palm of his hand, but a blow with the whole fist, and it was a big, heavy, bony fist covered with red hairs and freckles. 
But the conquest of fear was what fascinated them. The continual ecstasy of vanquishing and the consciousness that no one could vanquish them was what attracted them. 
He had scarcely regained his balance after being almost knocked over in this humiliating way, and the horrible, as it were, sodden, thud of the blow in the face had scarcely died away in the room when he seized Shatov by the shoulders with both hands, but at once, almost at the same instant, pulled both hands away and clasped them behind his back. 
He did not speak, but looked at Shatov, and turned as white as his shirt. 
I went to see him on Tuesday and knocked at his door. 
And what was there they didn't say! 
When very soberminded and sensible people smiled at this rumour, observing very reasonably that a man always, mixed up with scandals, and who was beginning his career among us, with a swollen face did not look like a government official, they were told in a whisper that he was employed not in the official, but, so to say, the confidential service, and that in such cases it was essential to be as little like an official as possible. 
It immediately became known to every one that Yulia Mihailovna had made a special call on Varvara Petrovna> and had been informed at the entrance: “Her honour was too unwell to see visitors.” 
I may observe, by the way, that she was already gradually beginning to gain that exalted influence among us for which she was so eager and which she was certainly struggling to win, and was already beginning to see herself “surrounded by a circle.” 
At first, however, he was ill, especially on Monday. He had an attack of his summer cholera. 
Sometimes, too, it seemed to me that the mysterious determination he had taken seemed to be failing him and he appeared to be struggling with a new, seductive stream of ideas. 
I suspected that he was longing to assert himselfagain, to come forth from his seclusion, to show fight, to struggle to the last. 
“But why have you been arguing with him, Stepan Trofimovitch?” I asked him reproachfully. 
“They say that French cleverness ... “he babbled suddenly, as though in a fever ...” that's false, it always has been. 
She beamed at me from the distance, laughed, and nodded in a very friendly way. 
He did not receive Pyotr Stepanovitch either, though the latter ran round to Varvara Petrovna's two or three times a day so long as he remained in the town. 
“I'm sure you've done your best.” 
I've come with the frankest explanations which I stand in more need of than you—so much for your vanity, but at the same time it's true. I've come to be open with you from this time forward.” 
You would not have said 'you're clever,' granted; I'll let it pass anyway. 
By the way, I always say a lot, that is, use a great many words and talk very fast, and I never speak well. 
You're laughing? 
“Just so, just so!” Pyotr Stepanovitch caught him up, apparently delighted. 
“You say you've changed your ideas about me?” he asked. 
I'll let them know, they'll meet together, and we'll go in the evening. 
Virginsky is a universal humanity man, Liputin is a Fourierist with a marked inclination for police work; a man, I assure you, who is precious from one point of view, though he requires strict supervision in all others; and, last of all, that fellow with the long ears, he'll read an account of his own system. 
“I notice it's awfully hard to make you angry today, and I begin to be afraid of you. 
“Afterwards, perhaps, not now. 
“It does not matter.” 
“In Russian, on the sly, of course, Yulia Mihailovna knows and allows it. 
I won't,” he cried out suddenly, “I'm not referring to that — not a word on delicate subjects. 
“I can well believe it; you should go to bed. 
The Shpigulin factory's interesting; as you know, there are five hundred workmen in it, it's a hotbed of cholera, it's not been cleaned for fifteen years and the factory hands are swindled. 
“I hear you're going in for being a gentleman here,” said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch with a smile. 
Oh yes, by the way, again, if you meant anything of that plan, you remember, about Lizaveta Nikolaevna, I tell you once again, I too am a fellow ready for anything of any kind you like, and absolutely at your service.... 
Perhaps he imagined, as he made his exit, that as soon as he was left alone, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch would begin beating on the wall with his fists, and no doubt he would have been glad to see this, if that had been possible. 
At last, when he was dressed and had put on his hat, he locked the door by which his mother had come into the room, took the letter from under the paperweight, and without saying a word went out into the corridor, followed by Alexey Yegorytch. 
But opening his umbrella the latter went without a word into the damp and sodden garden, which was dark as a cellar. 
The little sandy paths were wet and slippery. 
“Won't it be noticed?” Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch asked suddenly. 
“At one or halfpast, not later than two.” 
It appeared that Alexey Yegorytch had the key in his hand. 
It was past ten when he stopped at last before the locked gates of the dark old house that belonged to Filipov. 
It had only just been taken out of the cradle. 
The woman immediately carried it out of the room. 
“I know he won't agree.” 
There'll be two pairs of pistols, and we'll toss up, his or ours?” “Excellent.” 
“Would you like to look at the pistols?” “Very well.” 
“I understand shooting oneself, of course,” Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch began suddenly, frowning a little, after a dreamy silence that lasted three minutes. 
“Suppose you had lived in the moon,” Stavrogin interrupted, not listening, but pursuing his own thought, “and suppose there you had done all these nasty and ridiculous things.... 
“I don't know,” answered Kirillov. 
“That'll scarcely be possible in our time,” Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch responded slowly and, as it were, dreamily; the two spoke without the slightest irony. 
I didn't know then that I was happy. 
It was decayed at the edges. 
That motherinlaw will die; but the baby will remain. It's all good. 
I discovered it all of a sudden.” 
And if anyone blows his brains out for the baby, that's good too. 
“You were so sure I should come then?” 
He got up and seized something that was lying on the uppermost of his three bookshelves. 
It was a revolver. 
He sat down. 
“I see from your eyes that you were prepared for anything from me rather than that,” said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, with a faint smile. 
“Here, take it, the hundred roubles you sent me; but for you I should have perished out there. 
She made me a present of that note nine months ago, because I was so badly off after my illness. 
They gave you no answer, but charged you to take over a printing press here in Russia from some one, and to keep it till you handed it over to some one who would come from them for it. 
“That Verhovensky is such a fellow that he may be listening to us now in your passage, perhaps, with his own ears or some one else's. 
Shatov made a wry face at hearing such a question asked in such a matterof fact tone. “If I were a spy, whom could I inform?” he said angrily, not giving a direct answer. 
“You, you, Stavrogin, how could you mix yourself up with such shameful, stupid, secondhand absurdity? 
In fact, from the very beginning I told them that I was not one of them, and that if I've happened to help them it has simply been by accident as a man of leisure. 
But now they've changed their views, and have made up their minds that it would be dangerous to let me go, and I believe I'm sentenced to death too.” 
Please don't laugh about it, he's quite capable of pulling a trigger. 
I beseech you to allow me ... I can't ... ask your question!” 
“I've heard that you have some influence on Marya Timofyevna, and that she was fond of seeing you and hearing you talk. Is that so?” 
Tell me, can you spare me another ten minutes? ... 
Drop your tone, and speak like a human being! Speak, if only for once in your life with the voice of a man. 
Do you understand that you ought to forgive me that blow in the face if only because I gave you the opportunity of realising your immense power.... 
“Since I have remained another halfhour with you when time is so precious,” he pronounced earnestly and impressively, “you may rest assured that I mean to listen to you at least with interest ... and I am convinced that I shall hear from you much that is new.” 
“I know them very well. 
“It's your phrase altogether, not mine. 
Seriously, tell me seriously, didn't you read all my letter from America, perhaps you didn't read it at all?” 
The two first and the last. 
Damn it!” cried Shatov, waving his hand..”If you've renounced those words about the people now, how could you have uttered them then? ... 
You pointed out that if France is in agonies now it's simply the fault of Catholicism, for she has rejected the iniquitous God of Rome and has not found a new one. That's what you could say then! 
“This examination will be over for all eternity, and you will never hear it mentioned again.” “You keep insisting that we are outside the limits of time and space.” 
Nations are built up and moved by another force which sways and dominates them, the origin of which is unknown and inexplicable: that force is the force of an insatiable desire to go on to the end, though at the same time it denies that end. 
God is the synthetic personality of the whole people, taken from its beginning to its end. 
Reason has never had the power to define good and evil, or even to distinguish between good and evil, even approximately; on the contrary, it has always mixed them up in a disgraceful and pitiful way; science has even given the solution by the fist. 
Oh, how I despise your haughty laughter and your look at this minute!” 
I'm a man of no talent, and can only give my blood, nothing more, like every man without talent; never mind my blood either! 
Here I've been dancing about in my nakedness before you for the last halfhour. 
“I merely mention it as something queer,” Stavrogin interrupted suddenly. “Every one for some inexplicable reason keeps foisting a flag upon me. 
Is it true that you decoyed and corrupted children? 
Speak, don't dare to lie,” he cried, beside himself. “Nikolay Stavrogin cannot lie to Shatov, who struck him in the face. 
“But you talked like that,” Shatov went on imperiously, keeping his flashing eyes fastened upon him. 
“I don't know either why evil is hateful and good is beautiful, but I know why the sense of that distinction is effaced and lost in people like the Stavrogins,” Shatov persisted, trembling all over. 
“But what is it you want?” Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch asked, raising his voice at last. 
“You're an atheist because you're a snob, a snob of the snobs. 
You're speaking of Marya Timofyevna,” said Shatov, waving one hand, while he held a candle in the other. 
Moreover Pyotr Stepanovitch gives me hopes of a passport, and a merchant's one, too, to go all over Russia, so I'm waiting on his kindness. 
Last Friday I filled myself as full of pie as Martin did of soap; since then I didn't eat one day, and the day after I fasted, and on the third I'd nothing again. 
“Let me take your umbrella, please. 
And, indeed, the whole room was obviously kept extremely clean. 
Even the walls smell of resin and remind me of nature. 
“I see that you haven't changed a bit in these four years and more, captain,” said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, somewhat more amiably. 
In this way he killed two birds with one stone, satisfying at once his poetical aspirations and his desire to be of service; but now he had a third special and very ticklish object in view. 
All her followers turn away, all her suitors are gone. A pretty kettle of fish. 
And yet the lady was offended by the letter and the verses. 
“Repeat the verses,” said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch sternly. 
What will people think? 
If you haven't written, have you blabbed to anybody here? 
If you had an idea you should have kept it to yourself. 
The officers in the regiment gave me a thrashing, but, bless them for it, let me go. 
The public announcement of the marriage seemed to him absurd. 
Besides these there were two books with coloured pictures—one, extracts from a popular book of travels, published for juvenile reading, the other a collection of very light, edifying tales, for the most part about the days of chivalry, intended for Christmas presents or school reading. 
Her hair was done up in the same little close knot at the back of her head; her long thin neck was exposed in the same way. 
She held out her hands timorously also. 
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch sat down and waited. 
He saw that she several times wanted, very much in fact, to look at him again, but that she obstinately controlled herself and kept her eyes cast down. 
But she seemed not to hear him. 
Only Dasha's an angel. 
“Who told you that? 
Now my dreams are not good, and my dreams are bad, because you've come. 
It's too late for me to begin a third life.” 
The countess would have liked to eat me, though she did make me sit in the carriage beside her. 
(Her chin and lips were twitching.) 
She wanted to say something more, but suddenly, for the third time, the same terror instantly distorted her face, and again she drew back, putting her hand up before her. 
I'll sit as though I weren't expecting anything, and I'll take up a book, and suddenly you'll come in after five years' travelling. 
He seized her firmly above the elbow; she laughed in his face. 
Oh heavens! That alone kept me happy for those five years that my falcon was living somewhere beyond the mountains, soaring, gazing at the sun.... 
At first Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch walked on without stopping, and for. some time did not even listen to the tramp who was pestering him again. 
I speak to you, sir, as to my father, or my own brother; for Pyotr Stepanovitch will never learn that from me, and not a soul in the world. 
You might set my mind at rest, so that I might know the real truth; for we can't get on without assistance.” 
Things were hastened forward by Gaganov's obstinate desire to fight at all costs. He did not understand his adversary's conduct, and was in a fury. 
Strange as it is to write, the original design, or rather desire, to leave the army was due to the proclamation of the 19th of February of the emancipation of the serfs. 
He was secretive and selfcontained. 
He kept imagining that the duel would somehow not come off; the least delay threw him into a tremor. 
“I entirely agree with Mr. Kirillov's words.... 
Only then they saw that Gaganov had not missed him completely, but the bullet had only grazed the fleshy part of his finger without touching the bone; it was only a slight scratch. 
Kirillov at once announced that the duel would go on, unless the combatants were satisfied. 
“I declare,” said Gaganov hoarsely (his throat felt parched), again addressing Mavriky Nikolaevitch, “that this man,” again he pointed in Stavrogin's direction, “fired in the air on purpose ... intentionally.... 
I'm not restricting the duel at all.” “In that case the encounter can go on,” said Mavriky Nikolaevitch to Gaganov. 
I'll fire a third time ... whatever happens.” 
Kirillov picked up the hat and handed it to Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch. 
Mavriky Nikolaevitch went up and began saying something to him, but he did not seem to understand. 
“Why don't you speak?” he called impatiently to Kirillov, when they were not far from home. 
“I've done all I can, anyway.” “No.” 
Stavrogin had a very preoccupied face. 
“What ought I to have done then?” “You ought to have killed him.” 
“Are you sorry I didn't kill him?” 
“I thought you were seeking it,” Kirillov commented with terrible unconcern. 
He learned at once from Alexey Yegorytch that Varvara Petrovna had been very glad to hear that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had gone out for a ride—the first time he had left the house after eight days' illness. 
“Keep watch over her all today, and if you notice her coming to me, stop her at once, and tell her that I can't see her for a few days at least ... that I ask her not to come myself.... 
Bring me some tea, if you can, at once.” The old man had hardly gone out, when almost at the same instant the door reopened, and Darya Pavlovna appeared in the doorway. 
“Where have you come from?” exclaimed Stavrogin. 
“I was standing there, and waiting for him to go out, to come in to you. 
“I've long meant to break off with you, Dasha ... for a while ... for the present. 
The announcement of the marriage won't be today?” she added irresolutely. 
I've made up my mind to that. 
You know all that.” 
Do you know, ever since last night I feel awfully inclined to laugh, to go on laughing continually for ever so long. 
“She will come even after the shop,” he whispered, thinking a moment, and an expression of scornful disdain came into his face. 
They all persisted in assuming a romance of some sort, some fatal family secret, something that had happened in Switzerland, and for some reason imagined that Yulia Mihailovna must have had some hand in it. 
It was difficult to understand why these rumours, or rather fancies, persisted so obstinately, and why Yulia Mihailovna was so positively connected with it. 
He drawled, too, and spoke with peculiar suavity, probably having picked up the habit from Russians travelling abroad, or from those wealthy landowners of former days who had suffered most from the emancipation. 
Is there any house where he visits here?” 
“Yes, Pyotr Mihailovitch, yes,” the other chimed in with zest, “talk of the younger generation!” 
And now, suddenly, every one was positive that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was betrothed to one of the count's daughters, though nothing had given grounds for such a supposition. 
And as for some wonderful adventures in Switzerland with Lizaveta Nikolaevna, even the ladies quite dropped all reference to it. 
Every one now confidently considered Lizaveta Nikolaevna a most ordinary girl, who paraded her delicate nerves. 
They even increased the prosaicness of that to which before they had striven to give such a fantastic colour. 
They were ashamed to remember her. “And if there had been a hundred lame girls—we've all been young once!” 
In all eyes fastened upon him could be read eager anticipation. 
In a word, he was a success, he was the fashion. 
Family pride, of course, helped her to get over it. 
She did, however, pay a visit of ceremony to the governor's wife. 
I could make nothing of it and was in complete amazement. Karmazinov, too, says it's hard to understand it. 
They all see nothing in it now, Russians and English alike. 
I think Stepan Trofimovitch might read us something too, if it were quite short and ... not so very learned. 
You've quite sent him to Coventry. 
We'll trot him out, you know; I'm reckoning on him for something, and he may still be useful.” 
She frowned. 
It was remarkable that they had not once met during those five days, though Pyotr Stepanovitch had dropped in at Varvara Petrovna's almost every day. 
Alas, I must confess one strange weakness in my friend; the fantasy that he ought to come forth from his solitude and fight a last battle was getting more and more hold upon his deluded imagination. 
Oh, how that book tortured him! 
“You old fogies are all so devilishly ambitious. 
I told her in so many words that all this friendship of yours is nothing but a mutual pouring forth of sloppiness. 
I positively blushed for you.” 
“Worse, you've been a parasite, that is, a voluntary flunkey too lazy to work, while you've an appetite for money. 
I did laugh, my boy, over your letters to her; shameful and disgusting. 
I believe there are more than two thousand letters there. 
She sees for herself that you needed money like every one else, and that from that point of view maybe you were right. 
She's not angry about the money, though you have milked her like a goat. 
She's only in a rage at having believed in you for twenty years, at your having so taken her in over these noble sentiments, and made her tell lies for so long. 
“Rather! 
It's simple and clear.” “Tell me, you monster, are you my son or not?” 
“Another word and I'll box your ears.” 
I'm not to blame because you and she managed so stupidly in Berlin. 
Aren't you an .absurd set, after that? 
Pyotr Stepanovitch certainly had some designs on his parent. 
Andrey Antonovitch von Lembke belonged to that race, so favoured by nature, which is reckoned by hundreds of thousands at the Russian census, and is perhaps unconscious that it forms throughout its whole mass a strictly organised union. 
He was distinguished, too, by intentional untidiness, thinking this, for some reason, witty. 
Board of Trustees 
The Board of Trustees elects an Execution Board comprised of the Chairman and two members to use its authority in financial affairs and to allocate the budget. 
It performs other duties assigned within the Core Regulations. 
Faculty, Institute and Higher School Executive Boards 
The reporters of the Executive Boards are the secretaries of the concerned faculty, institute and higher school. 
At the end of this term, Deans and Institute and Higher School Directors may be appointed again for at most three years. 
They may be appointed again for the same term. 
Amendments to the Core Regulations 
(Surat alHashr: 18) 
It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. 
Thanks to their effective, lucid narrative, they can be read at a one sitting. 
All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
Even at times when you think you are alone you have never really been alone. 
Allah’s appointed angels are constantly monitoring and inscribing everything that you do. 
However, if he is among those whose Books are given in their left hands, he will then say: 
Fear Allah and know that Allah has knowledge of all things. 
The Qur’an makes mention in many verses of the deep awe that believers possess: 
Although a believer fears Allah, he should never forget Allah’s compassion, mercy and forgiveness, or that He is the One Who due to His generosity accepts repentance. 
Allah’s mercy is close to the gooddoers. 
Thus, Allah reveals this secret in the Qur’an: 
They fear Allah’s warnings 
On the other hand, those who refuse to believe cannot properly comprehend the meanings of the Book of Allah, even if they do read it. 
When the time comes, the punishment they have denied will manifest as certain truth. Allah declares in one of His verses: 
However, this is not so, they are people who once inhabited the Earth who you may have seen walking along the street, some of whom you may recognize and know personally. 
Amongst Allah’s creatures, it is only the true believers who are aware of Allah’s great warning and whose condition is one of fear and hope: 
Love of Allah can only be achieved with nearness to Allah, which becomes a reality when one develops an intimate and sincere attachment to Him. 
Arguing that fear of Allah is unnecessary is in fact no different from saying, “there is no need for fasting, prayer and worship.” 
The Qur’an is full of references to Allah punishing some people as a result of the sins they have committed on Earth. 
A prime example of this is the story of Qarun, who was given great wealth by Allah. As a result of this vast wealth he became arrogant and developed an exaggerated sense of his own selfimportance. 
When they make a mistake or even commit a wrong action, they are aware that Allah could respond immediately and so they turn to Him in a state of remorse and repentance, begging Him for forgiveness. 
To persist consciously with such behavior is clear evidence of failure to appreciate the totality of Allah’s power. 
If Allah willed, He could at any moment withdraw all of the blessings He has bestowed upon mankind. This is referred to in the Qur’anic verses cited below: 
The reality is that everything a person owns, every breath he takes, every second of his life he owes to Allah, and because true believers are aware of these realities they are constantly mindful of exceeding Allah’s limits. 
People should never be satisfied with themselves and what they have done insofar as they remain conscious of death becoming a reality at any moment and being caught illprepared for an end that has no return. One should spend every moment striving to protect Allah’s limits. They fear the Day of Judgment 
He will know that benefit and loss, good and bad can only come from Allah, that all the incidents he will encounter are only the will and creation of Allah in accordance with the fate predetermined for him by Allah. 
Allah mentions this quality in the verse cited below: 
They said, “Do not be afraid. We are two litigants, one of whom has acted unjustly towards the other, so judge between us with truth and do not be unjust and guide us to the Right Path. 
This brother of mine has ninetynine ewes and I have only one.” 
Their continuous and consistent praise and exaltation of Allah is an indication of their total love and attachment to Him. 
In total contrast to this however, those who have not been given the ability to discriminate are destined for ruin, both on Earth and in the Hereafter. A double share from Allah’s mercy 
By Allah, they are capable of overcoming every obstacle by using the intelligence and understanding He has provided them with. 
Truly Allah forgives all wrong actions. 
Instead of distress, Allah causes to descend upon their hearts a feeling of peace and security. 
Believers who fear an encounter with the infinite punishment of Hell, and who are mindful of not rebelling against Allah, will gain the reward of those who fear and act cautiously as Allah has promised, and they will be sent to enter their eternal home: 
My devotees, you will feel no fear today; you will know no sorrow. 
… They will have whatever they wish for with their Lord. 
The Qur’an describes every aspect of everlasting life for the believers in the Garden, such as their places of residence, their clothing, their spouses, the beauty of the surroundings, the foodstuffs and various other delights that await them. 
In one Qur’anic verse the eternal lives led by those who fear Allah and the terrifying end to be faced by those who do not fear Allah are compared: 
Is that like those who will be in the Fire timelessly, for ever, with boiling water to drink which lacerates their bowels? 
Allah has promised the men and women of the believers Gardens with rivers flowing under them, remaining in them timelessly, for ever, and fine dwellings in the Gardens of Eden. 
To have gained Allah’s approval will be the source of a joy and happiness infinitely superior to any earthly comparison. 
Allah’s pleasure is what brings the ultimate sweetness to the blessings of the Garden. Although the rewards of the Garden are wonderful in themselves, what is more delightful still is the joy of being affirmed by The Lord of all the Worlds as being worthy of receiving His kindness. 
Say, “So will you not guard against evil?” 
As openly revealed by Allah in His verses, when those people who possess only superficial belief are asked about it, they will admit their belief in Allah, but the fearful awareness of Him will be found wanting. 
Generally amongst the populace an understanding of religion based on hearsay is widespread. 
As a result of this, people’s understanding regarding Allah varies widely. 
As well as being unable to give Allah the recognition due to Him, many ignorant people also possess deficient knowledge and many false beliefs about the Garden and the Fire. 
These people enjoy their lives on Earth to their hearts’ desire, they rebel against Allah and then, they assume they will be forgiven after spending a short period in Hell. 
Allah has informed us of this reality in the Qur’an: 
Or do you feel secure against Him taking you back into it another time and sending a violent storm against you and drowning you for your ingratitude? 
The distresses of trials and hardships can only be faced by relying on Allah and receiving strength from Him. 
These ignorant people conjure up values and priorities in the name of Islam, which are very different from those contained in the Qur’an. 
An evil generation has succeeded them, inheriting the Book, taking the goods of this lower world, and saying, “We will be forgiven…” (Surat alA‘raf: 169) 
We have prepared for them a painful punishment. 
Say: “So how have you been bewitched?” 
With regard to fearing Allah as is due is to Him, this is only made possible by constantly bearing in mind and reflecting on Allah’s greatness, glory and grandeur, His high rank, infinite knowledge and power, and His unrestricted and unconditional sovereignty over all His servants, as well as having an absolute belief in Allah’s promises, threats, the Day of Judgment and the intensity of its ordeals and the fearful and eternal punishment of Hell. 
This belief will make way for a strengthened fear of Allah. 
Without a doubt, the oppression practiced by these people will be responded to in kind in the Hereafter. 
The angels readily obeyed Allah’s command and prostrated before Adam (as). 
The likeness of those who disbelieve is that of the beast which, call out to it as one may, can hear nothing but a shout and a cry. 
The tragic demise of Qarun constitutes an open and clear example to those who do not possess any fear of Allah, and who are caught up with being haughty. 
A pleasant destination in the Hereafter however, is reserved for those sincere people who are not arrogant: 
Truly I fear Allah, the Lord of all the worlds. 
Human beings and other living creatures are inherently weak and constantly in need. They are subject to Allah’s purposes in the creation and are at every moment entirely dependent on Him for life and sustenance. 
Despite seeing people around them dying, in spite of knowing that the Hereafter awaits them, in spite of the ageing of their own bodies and the stepbystep approach of the end, they do not fear Allah, and so refuse to think about death at all. 
They think that everything happens by chance and that the events that occur around them are without rhyme or reason. 
For example, he could fall sick with an unexpected illness, lose all his wealth, or perhaps an unexpected catastrophe could befall him or his loved ones. 
They said, “We will never enter it, Musa, as long as they are there. 
We will stay sitting here.” 
Consequences experienced on Earth 
However, they are unaware that everything they do is being recorded second by second, and that in Hell, Allah will present them with it all as a source of endless punishment. 
They cannot comprehend even the most basic of realities. 
Therefore, one can only try to imagine the pain and suffering occasioned by Allah’s detestation: 
These people perished in an instant due to their rebelliousness and noncompliance with Allah’s limitations. 
One would shiver at the thought of committing the least transgression or making any remark that might jeopardize one’s prospects in the Hereafter. One would immediately turn to Allah supplicating and begging for His forgiveness. 
He would take every opportunity to do as much as possible for his own benefit in the Hereafter. 
Given the enormous importance of this subject, it will be of great benefit to summarize it here. 
The theory maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e. g., ears, eyes, lungs, and wings) underwent “mutations,” that is, genetic disorders. 
Thinking even a little bit on the claims of tevolutionists discloses this reality, just as in the above example. 
Technology in the Eye and the Ear 
Many people who see its true face are wondering with amazement how they could ever have been taken in by it. They said, “Glory be to You! 
He was almost panting now. 
Come and see what Mr. Jingles can do! And overhead, the thunder banged again. 
Del tried to speak and at first nothing came out but a terrified whisper full of air and vowelsounds. 
The shadow of a contemptuous smile touched the corners of Percy's lips, and I could have cheerfully shot him right there. 
I sorry for what I do," he said. 
As for Brutal, he never looked at Percy at all, not as Percy bent over the bucket (moving so as to partially block what he was doing from our view), not as he straightened up and turned to Del with the cap in his hands and the brown circle of sponge already inside it. Brutal was looking at the cloth which had replaced Del's face, watching the way the black silk mask drew in, outlining the circle of Del's open mouth, and then puffed out again with his breath. 
Delacroix began to jitter and twist inthe chair, his maskcovered face snapping from side to side as if in some vehement refusal. 
But those of us on the platform heard him, all right choked howls of pain from beneath the smoking mask, sounds an animal caught and mangled in a haybaler might make. 
What the hell's happening to him?" someone cried. 
The mask burst into flame on Delacroix's face. 
Brutal came up and stood beside me, holding the fire extinguisher. 
Anderson had turned around and was bawling at the panicky witnesses, telling them everything was all right, everything was under control, just a powersurge from the electrical storm, nothing to worry about. Next thing, he'd be telling them that what they smelleda devil's mixture of burned hair, fried meat, and freshbaked shitwas Chanel No. 5. 
Over and out of here were two concepts that appealed to him just then. 
That was good. But the way Brutal was looking at Percy wasn't. 
"Get them all back by the door." 
I steeled myself as best I could, then put the disc of the stethoscope on the redblack patch of raw flesh I'd made on Del's chest. 
What do you mean, no?" he asked me furiously. 
Brutal stared at me, mouth agape, eyes so angry they were watering. 
Listen to me, Brutusyou take a poke at him, and most likely we all go. You, me, Dean, Harry, maybe even Jack Van Hay. 
I switched my attention back to Brutal. 
Was the plan, or the beginnings of it, in my head even then? 
Don't worry about that," he said sullenly. 
I'd get away with it. 
I can hear him!" 
Brutal pointed at the gurney, and the shape under the sheet. 
They volunteered for the damn job, nobody drafted them." 
What matters to the Percys of the world is how it plays in the newspapers. 
"If they tried, their editors'd kill it. 
Too gruesome for a family audience. 
They know it as well as we do." 
He turned and started up the stairs. 
I went down to John Coffey. 
The shoe was related, but different. 
All my real idea was right then, however, was an odd realization: that John Coffey and Melinda Moores, different as they might have been in size and sex and skin color, had exactly the same eyes: woeful, sad, and distant. 
How could she know those words?" 
When he was well and in charge of himself, not distracted by worry or grief, Hal Moores had a cutting and sarcastic facet to his personality; his subordinates feared that side of him even more than his anger or his contempt, I think. 
Why do you ask?" It doesn't matter, I guess," I said. 
Lying was out of the question; it wasn't the way we were with each other. 
Coffey did something to it. 
Did he suck it out of you?" Brutal asked. 
The hurt. 
"The touch and the breath. 
God works in mysterious ways His wonders to perform. 
You want to balance it off somehow." 
Even Warden Moores had been a party to it. "His nuts are going to cook whether Wetmore's on the team or not," he had said, and maybe that was well enough, considering what the little Frenchman had done, but in the end Percy had done a lot more than cook Del's nuts; he had blown the little man's eyeballs right out of their sockets and set his damned face on fire. 
It's what God made him for." 
He's so hardheaded he makes old Doubting Thomas look like Joan of Arc. 
Also, he's huge. 
I didn't know just how to begin. 
I've had a lot of easy starts since I started telling the story of John Coffey, but yesterday I had to crank. 
I think it was because I'd gotten to Delacroix's execution, and part of my mind didn't want to have to relive that. 
That's how it worked for me yesterday. 
Perhaps I only feel that way because I've become a very old man (a thing that happened behind my own back, I sometimes feel), but I don't think so. 
In any case, I wrote all day yesterday, the words simply flooding out of me, the sunroom of this glorified old folks' home gone, replaced by the storage room at the end of the Green Mile where so many of my problem children took their last sitmedowns and the bottom of the stairs which led to the tunnel under the road. That was where Dean and Harry and Brutal and I confronted Percy Wetmore over Eduard Delacroix's smoking body and made Percy renew his promise to put in for transfer to the Briar Ridge state mental facility. 
I found myself looking around for Dolan even though his car was gone, called myself a chump for letting him get so far under my skin, and crossed the croquet course. 
On many nights I'll wake up and creep back down to the TV room, where I watch old movies on the American Movie Channel. 
When I woke and saw that the patch of sun which usually lies on the floor at six in the morning had made it all the way up to the foot of my bed, I hit the deck in a hurry, so alarmed I hardly noticed the arthritic flare of pain in my hips and knees and ankles. 
The car was there, gleaming rustily in the morning sun. Because Mr. Brad Dolan has something to arrive on time for these days, doesn't he? 
Yes. Old Paulie Edgecombe goes somewhere in the early mornings, old Paulie Edgecombe is up to something, and Mr. Brad Dolan intends to find out what it is. What do you do down there, Paulie? 
"I didn't mean to startle you." 
He's not in the west wing, either. 
That's because he was a resident before the rules changed." 
As we did, I decided to give up and put myself in her hands. 
I'm going over to the west wing, to the hall toilet there. 
And I'm going to make myself scarce as soon as the smoke detector turns on the westwing fire alarm." 
Edgecombe!" Kent Avery rasped, hanging onto his walker with one hand and yanking obsessively at the crotch of his pajama pants with the other. 
The quavering in his voice, coupled with the memory of how John Coffey had healed both my urinary infection and the broken back of Delacroix's pet mouse, had finally pushed me over the line that runs between just thinking about a thing and actually doing a thing. 
So when I suggested that another miracle might result if we took John Coffey to Melinda Moores, they didn't outright laugh. 
There was silence, then, all of them looking at me, waiting to see how I'd respond. 
Except retreat, for me, at least, was already impossible. 
How can you be?" There are two things," I said. 
I took off one of my shoes and gave it to him last night," I said. After the execution, this was, when things had settled back down a little. 
The Dettericks' dog wasn't much of a biter, but it was a worldclass barker," I said. 
"How come no one brought that up at the trial?" 
Nobody was really equipped to think of it, Coffey's own attorney included." 
What?" Dean asked. 
I didn't feel like I could have stopped doing what he wanted, even if I'd tried." 
Is that when you knew? 
I tried to take it back, but it was too late.' 
"The question right now is what we door don't doabout Melly. 
Probably nothing will, but maybe ..." 
And it's to be tonight? 
If we're going to do it, it had better be tonight," Harry said. "If I get a chance to think about it, I'll most likely lose my nerve." 
I think we might be the only chance she has left," I said at last. 
I thought I could still smell the faint, lingering odor of burned flesh on the air. 
I believe he wanted to tip me a wink, but restrained himself. 
The truck?" I asked. 
Where we talked about." 
Dean came back and gave me a little nod. 
That should be creative," Brutal remarked, hooking his thumbs into his belt and looking up at the ceiling. 
No, not sick. 
If that meant lathering on the softsoap, I would gladly lather it on. 
Where's my supper?" 
You don't con me that easy." 
We shook our heads. 
Then it got to be ten of twelve, I could stand it no longer and gave Dean a little nod. 
"We'll come in and take it back. 
And you will have drunk your last R. C. Unless they serve it down in hell, that is." 
His smile faded. 
With Paul," Brutal said, "the quality of mercy is not strained; it droppeth like the gentle rain from heaven." 
Percy snorted. 
We're going to do it." You don't want to wait for beautiful there to pass out?" 
He handed it to Brutal. 
The three of us walked up the Green Mile. 
Percy's eyes widened, and he lunged. 
It wasn't The Last Days of Sodom and Gomorrah, but it was the one we sometimes gave to inmates who were feeling especially horny and who had been wellbehaved enough to deserve a treat. 
Brutal tossed me the straitjacket and pushed his face up into Percy's. 
Sure thing. 
Percy's lips were trembling, and his eyes were too bright. 
An oven that wasn't cooking the way you wanted, Percy let out a miserable shriek of pain and surprise that I would have given a great deal not to have heard. 
Things had gone much too far for that. 
Into the restraint room we went, Percy's cheeks red and wet with tears, his eyes rolling into their sockets, his pampered locks all flopping down on his forehead. Harry pulled Percy's gun with one hand and his treasured hickory, headknocker with the other. 
He stood in the middle of the room, under the caged light, wearing the straitjacket, breathing through flared nostrils, and making muffled mmmph! mmmph! sounds from behind the tape. 
You still want to go for that ride, John?" 
Coffey appeared to think about this. 
Coffey's reaction was remarkable. 
He had looked that way again when he'd been holding his hands out for the mouse. 
He was snoring before his head touched his thin prison pillow, deep blue shadows brushed under the hollows of his eyes and the tip of his tongue lolling out. 
No more than one, though. We don't want to kill him." Speak for yourself," Brutal rumbled, and gave Wharton a contemptuous look. 
John Coffey considered the question carefully, then shook his head. 
He sat down, scooted through it that way, stood up again, and went down the stairs to where Brutal was waiting for him. 
At first he wouldn't go, and I might as well have been trying to pull a boulder out of the ground with my bare hands. 
They're still in there. Pieces of them, still in there. 
Come on!" I said. 
We went down the stairs with Coffey in the lead. 
At the top, Harry got around him (not without some difficulty, either, although he was the smallest of the three of us) and unlocked the bulkhead. 
He could move it, but wasn't able to flip it up. 
He pushed to the front againbumping Harry into the wall with one hip as he did soand raised the bulkhead with one hand. 
We breasted the first rise and walked down the other side, where all we could see of the prison was the bright glow of the lights in the tops of the trees. And still Harry led us onward. 
As far as Coffey was concerned, we had ceased to exist. His head was tilted back and he was drinking in the sight of the stars sprawling across the sky. 
If we don't end up making that one locked into the back of our own stagecoach, that is." 
Look, boss!" he cried in a low, rapturous voice, pointing up into the black night. 
Why not? I remember thinking. 
For him it was more of a step than a jump. 
Then I grabbed Brutal's elbow like this was a date we were on and got the two of us walking toward the stoop where that light was now burning. 
Who the hell goes there at twothirty in the goddam morning?" he asked. 
"Who else is down by that truck?" 
I believe there is good in the world, all of it flowing in one way or another from a loving God. 
But I believe there's another force as well, one every bit as real as the God I have prayed to my whole life, and that it works consciously to bring all our decent impulses to ruin. 
Nothing I tried made any sense. 
He turned in that direction for just a moment, his face confused and despairing. 
The only emotions I remember feeling were fright and a kind of dull embarrassment for Hal. 
"It's all right! 
Moores's tangled, tufted eyebrows drew together. 
As if in answer, the old woman's voice rose again, querulous and certain and utterly lost: "Come in here and poke my mudhole, you son of a bitch! 
What are you doing here?" Moores asked us again. 
Is it a prison break, or..." 
When Coffey plucked the Buntline Special from his hand and passed it to me, I don't think Hal even knew it was gone. 
Just to help, boss, that's all." 
It was a tone I'd heard before, and after a moment I realized it was how I'd sounded myself when I'd gone into Coffey's cell the night he cured my urinary infection. 
We think he can," Brutal said. 
She took her handsas spongywhite as her faceout from under the counterpane and patted them together. 
I've heard about niggercocks my whole life but never seen one!" 
I don't hardly remember where they all come from, ma'am," John Coffey said in a humble voice, and sat down beside her on her bed. 
Hal was beside me now, breathing rapidly but not trying to interfere. 
He gripped it hard enough to leave a bruiseI saw it the next daybut right then I hardly felt it. What's your name?" she asked. 
The words barely breathed, barely slipping to us on the badsmelling, air. 
"I see it, and I can help. 
Then his smooth bald head moved, and that was gone, too. 
Hal Moores tried to have it repaired, but it never kept time for more than fifteen minutes at a stretch again. 
A portion was turning black, down by the jittering lump that was her right foot. 
He turned his head so as not to cough in her face, lost his balance which wasn't hard; big as he was, he'd been sitting with his butt halfway off the side of the bed to start with), and went down onto the floor. 
He landed on his knees and hung his head over, coughing like a man in the last stages of TB. I thought, Now the bugs. He's going to cough them out, and what a lot there'll be this time. 
John!" Brutal shouted. "Sick it up! 
It was as if she had stolen a couple of roses right out of the wallpaper. 
Did I have the Xray?" 
His face was still the color of ashes, and he looked ten years older, like a once powerful man at last losing a long battle with consumption. 
John Coffey, ma'am," he said, to which she immediately replied, "But not spelled like the drink." 
"Stand up, Hal, you're pinning me in here." 
I tapped him on the shoulder, hard enough to get his attention for a moment, at least. 
I think so. 
He looked at John Coffey, then put out one handjust as I had done on the day Harry and Percy escorted John onto the block. 
I could make it." 
She put her arms around him and gave him another hug. 
At the end of it was a silver medallion. 
"I got to take a leak, is all. 
I didn't like it. I walked into a clump of willows, unbuttoned, and let go. I was still dose enough to my urinary infection so that the body's amnesia had not taken full hold, and I could be grateful simply to be able to pee without needing to scream. 
And when we get squared away, you know what? 
If we don't get arrested and thrown in jail ourselves first. 
Thunder in the west and a smell that might have been juniper berries. 
Give them to me," Brutal said. "I'll do it." 
Beside me I could hear John Coffey's tortured breathing. 
Brutal and I got the door up, and Harry led john down the steps. 
Brutal and I followed him as fast as we could, then lowered the bulkhead behind us and locked it again. 
Our voices had a flat, echoey quality in the brick tunnel. 
"The evening ain't over as long as we got him to contend with." 
I got up, wincing, trying to stretch some life into my back. 
I was afraid of him, and I don't think that realization was entirely new. 
What you writin, anyway? 
When you let me see," he replied, and he was no longer smiling. 
From our trip with John back through the tunnel under the road. 
She had a tray in her arthritic handsjuice, a scrambled egg, toast, more tea. 
He can, and he's going to," she said in that same dry tone of command. 
His name is Mr. Edgecombe," she said, "and if I ever hear you call him Paulie again, I think I can promise you that your days of employment here at Georgia Pines will end, Mr. Dolan." 
He was hulking over her, now, trying to laugh and not quite making it. 
I was remembering how many times Percy Wetmore had threatened us with his connections, back in the bad old days. 
And without one more word." 
Speaker of the statehouse makes him powerful enough to deal with a roach like Brad Dolan, but it doesn't make him rich," she said, laughing. 
I offered her the pages I had clumsily swept together. 
"I'll go out back," she said. 
And the dragon's been vanquished," I said. 
She smiled, bent, and kissed me over the eyebrow in the sensitive place that always makes me shiver. 
His skin was so gray he looked as if he'd been rolled in flour. 
"You under his right arm, me under his left." 
In the end, we did manage to get John up the stairs. 
Let's hope it stays that way," Brutal said. 
He was able to cross the storage room under his own power, but we had to help him up the three steps to my office and then almost push him through the little door. 
John sat heavily on his bunk. 
Ready?" I asked them. 
"Want these back?" I asked. 
He looked at me warily, then nodded his head. 
Which is to say, if I didn't have him where I wanted now, I never would. 
He nodded his head. 
He was milkpale. 
We wouldn't have to do it ourselves. 
There was a long, long silence as he considered. 
"We'll consider the matter closed. 
With Brutal's hand digging into the soft sides of his face the way it was, Percy looked eerily like Old TootToot. 
Harry undid the last buckle on the straitjacket. 
Grimacing with disgust and rage, Percy pawed it off and let it drop at his feet. He wouldn't look at any of us, not directly. 
Percy, if you think about it" Oh, I intend to," he said, brushing past me. 
He reached the door of the restraint room and turned to survey us with a look of angry, embarrassed contempta deadly combination for the secret we'd had some fool's hope of keeping. 
He left the room and went striding up the Green Mile, forgetting in his agitation why that green floored central corridor was so wide. 
I followed him out the door, trying to think of a way to soothe him downI didn't want him leaving E Block the way he was now, sweaty and dishevelled, with the red print of my hand still on his cheek. 
John Coffey was a giant, and he had a giant's reach. 
I saw his long brown arms shoot out from between the bars and yelled, Watchit, Percy, watch it!" 
What wasn't going into him through his quivering mouth was flowing in by way of his nostrils. 
Then the hand on the nape of his neck flexed, and Percy was pulled forward onto John 's mouth again; was almost impaled on it. 
Percy's left hand sprang open. 
His treasured hickory baton fell to the green linoleum. 
Beneath me, I seemed to feel the floor shake as it had in the back bedroom of the Warden's neat little Cape Cod. 
What'd he do?" Brutal shouted. 
Brutal joined me, and reached toward Percy's empty face with both hands. 
He was outside of Wild Bill Wharton's cell by then. 
We ran at him, all four of us. 
Back near the beginning of this I wrote that Percy was at Briar Ridge by the time that Brutal found the colored slivers of Mr. Jingles's spool a couple of months later, and I didn't lie about that. 
He never got the office with the fan in the comer, though; never got a bunch of lunatic patients to push around, either. 
His face began to turn red. 
We didn't see that," Brutal said. 
See what?" 
As I talked, she brought me black coffee by the halfcup at first my hands were shaking too badly to pick up a whole one without spilling it. 
I don't know, Jan," I said. 
Percy had gone crazy and shot William Wharton to death. 
Do you hear me? 
He was quiet? 
Simpler would be better, and I knew it. 
That might be," I said, lowering my voice even more. 
Then she asked, Does Hal know it's a miracle, Paul? 
Does he understand that?" 
Naw," I said, tilting my bowl to capture the last spoonful, "probably would have cooked him some soup. 
John Coffey called him a bad man." 
An idea had come to me. 
"I don't know anything for sure, but I'm going to find out if I can." 
Well, the various gentlemen of the press took turns at that job. 
When you added in the fact that the young man in question remained just as mad as a March hare, you could understand why the governor only wanted it to go away, and as soon as possible. 
Now, however, it was Coffey's turn to walk the Green Mile, and who among us could stop it? 
Janice had kissed me on my way and wished me good luck; I'd thanked her but no longer had any clear idea what good luck would befinding what I was looking for or not finding it. 
By three that afternoon I was well up in the ridge country. 
Catlett thought it over and then told me something interesting. He said he'd deny he'd ever said a word if I spread it around, and it wasn't conclusive anyway, but it was something, all right. It was sure something. 
Come on home with me, we'll talk there," he said. 
McGee talked awhile. 
So what are you going to do?" 
Then I stood up. 
I'll tell you something, smart guy," he said, still speaking in that tone of hollow belligerence. 
"Probably because you're still upset. 
I expected an uproar when I told Brutal, Dean, and Harry what I knew (I couldn't prove it, but I knew, all right), but at first there was only thoughtful silence. 
If he did, he forgot it later." Sure," Dean said. 
More like threequarters. 
He took me back to his office, sat me down, gave me a cup of coffee and a sinker, and told me that sixteen months ago, when Wharton was barely eighteen, a man in the western part of the county caught him in the barn with his daughter. It wasn't rape, exactly; the fellow described it to Catlett as 'not much more'n stinkfinger., Sorry, honey." 
She looked pale, though. 
How old was the girl?" Brutal asked. Nine", I said. 
Brutal was laughing in spite of himself. 
It was three months later, give or take, that Wharton broke out and started the spree that ended with the holdup," I said. 
Next I told them about my visit to Trapingus County. 
In midMay, about a month before the holdup and the murders which finished Wharton's short career as an outlaw, Klaus Detterick had painted his barn (and, incidentally, Bowser's doghouse next to it). 
Even so," he added, "there's no law against a man sleeping rough in the woods, Mr. Edgecombe. 
He spoke in a low, gentle voice, the way you speak when you're telling someone there's been a death in the family. "On one hand you've got this fellow who helped Klaus Detterick paint a barn and then went away. 
About what got you going, first up to Purdom County and then down to Trapingus. 
Crimes he's committed, bigshots he's known, women he's gone to bed with, touchdowns he scored in high school, even the damn weather." 
"That's about the size of it." She sat with her head lowered, thinking. 
Why not?" 
She sat that way for almost a full minute, and then she did something which shocked me as badly as my sudden flow of tears must have shocked her. 
She reached out and shoved everything off the table with one wide sweep of her armplates, glasses, cups, silverware, the he bowl of collards, the bowl of squash, the platter with the carved ham on it, the milk, the pitcher of cold tea. 
I sat in the living room of our little house, smoking cigarettes, listening to the radio, and watching the dark come up out of the ground to swallow the sky. 
She was right. 
So far as I knew, there was no one like him on the planet. 
We can rustle you up most anything. 
Then the lines smoothed out and he smiled. 
Someone you could say a little prayer with, night after next? It comforts a man, so I've seen that many times. 
The feeling was strong inside me by then, and it was like before, when he'd cured my waterworks, but it was different, too. 
It was different because this time he didn't know he was doing it. 
"I wasn't thinkin. 
I could see the darkness he had spoken of, too. It lay in all the spaces of the world as he saw it, and in that moment I felt both pity for him and great relief. 
One of them had maybe started to cry out, so Wharton had hit her and she had bled from the nose. 
He smiled. 
Lying down was the last thing I felt like right thenthe idea seemed so ridiculous that I almost laughed. 
Still, halfway home that morning, it came back strong. 
He looked out through the bars at us, a lot calmer than we felt, it seemed. 
John Coffey, as an officer of the court..." 
I dreamed there was kids, and how they laughed at his tricks! My!" 
Dean was as white as paper. 
What should we pray for, boss?" John asked. 
And then, as I'd thought he might have to do, he helped me to my feet. 
Still, what could we do? 
I guessed I could understand why; the modified clamps had a hungry look, their jaws seeming to gape like the mouths of alligators. 
There was that hum, like an old fridge kicking on, and the lights burned a little brighter. 
I don't think he understood much, if any, of what Brutal was telling him, but he took comfort from Brutal's hand on his shoulder. 
"I'm sorry for what I am." 
Brutal was looking at me, eyebrows raised, frozen in place, the mask in his hands. 
Any more than you were in charge of catching him, you tub of guts," Harry whispered. 
Not in my league, of course, but few are. 
Dean Stanton ran the straplet out to its maximum length on this occasionacross John 's chest and gave it to me. 
Overhead, three of the hanging lights blew outPow! 
I parked my flivver, I got out, I walked up the back steps, and then the second greatest grief I have ever known washed over me. It was thinking of how he'd been afraid of the dark that did it. 
She put an arm over my shoulders. 
The first morning passed, and the first afternoon, then the first shift back at work. 
It's here, but I'll understand if you'd just as soon not" It isn't a question of what I want", she said. 
Sometimes you can't help people. 
Sometimes it's better not even to try. 
All right", she almost whispered. 
"Not scary." 
"I'm going to take these down to my room. 
"And poor Paul Edgecombe, too." 
The orderly who found her said she looked peaceful, as if it had come suddenly and without much pain. 
Peering over the edge of it were a pair of bright little oilspot eyes. 
From the bag on the table I took a spool which I had colored myselfnot with Crayolas but with Magic Markers, an invention undreamed of in It came to the same, though. 
He was old, but as obsessed as ever. 
As I've said, he was old, a Methuselah of a mouse. Sixtyfour, at least. 
When he'd first come I'd found him lying on the steps leading to the kitchen in just that same way, as if he'd travelled a long distance and was exhaustedhe had still been able to guide the spool with his paws, as he had done all those years ago on the Green Mile. 
That was beyond him, now; his hindquarters would no longer support him. Yet his nose was as educated as ever. 
I squatted again, broke a small fragment off the piece I'd brought with me from the sunroom, and put it on the floor. 
Lined it with the softest stuff I could find. 
Maybe only because, in a way, him chasing a spool was like old people having their slow and careful version of sexyou might not want to watch it, you who are young and convinced that, when it comes to old age, an exception will be made in your case, but they still want to do it. 
Mr. Jingles set off after the rolling spool again, clearly with pain, and just as clearly (to me, at least) with all his old, obsessive enjoyment. 
How far down the road had he driven after his shift was over? 
Don't you tell me to get out, you wrinkledy old bitch," he said, still smiling. 
Should we have a little funeral, with paper flowers and" SHUT up!" 
GET OUT OR YOU'LL NEVER WORK ANOTHER DAY HERE! 
I couldn't take my eyes off Mr. Jingles, lying on Elaine's palm like the world's smallest bearskin rug. 
He turned and strode away, looking like a man who believes he's earned at least a draw. I waited until he was gone, and then gently took Mr. Jingles from Elaine. 
And it was Del I found myself thinking of, Del kneeling on the green carpet of my office with his hands folded and his bald pate gleaming in the lamplight, Del who had asked us to take care of Mr. Jingles, to make sure the bad 'un wouldn't hurt him anymore. 
Our third grandchild, a beautiful girl named Tessa, was graduating from the University of Florida. 
Sixtyfour, I was then, a mere stripling. 
There were burstopen suitcases everywhere. 
I have often thought it would have been better for me, if not for herif she had been killed instantly. 
It might have made it possible for me to let her go a little sooner, a little more naturally. 
Once, earlier on in that awful year of 1956, I passed a gallstone. 
Need I tell you? I look back over these pages, leafing through them with my trembling, spotted hands, and I wonder if there is some meaning here, as in those books which are supposed to be uplifting and ennobling. 
“From where does the tiny bee learn how to make such tasty honey? 
So how did the first human all of a sudden appear?” 
Do you know what this correct answer is? 
Everything that you see around you, including yourself, your friends, your parents, the earth, the sun, the food that you love, bananas, cherries, strawberries, colourful roses, violets, beautiful scents, human beings, cats, dogs, ants, bees, horses, birds and butterflies, in short everything was created by Allah. 
Along with earth, the sun, moon, and millions of stars exist in it as well. 
I waited for a couple of years and then a computer emerged from this box.” 
What happens to the puzzle’s pieces that you had stuffed inside the balloon? 
Allah is the Maker of the “Big Bang”, the Organiser of the matter that scattered in space after the “Big Bang”. By bringing together all this matter, He is also the Creator of the sun, earth, planets and stars. 
Let’s consider how Allah created the earth so that living things can survive: 
We need oxygen in the air so that we can breathe. 
If even only one of these events doesn’t take place, no living thing would be left on earth. 
They won’t say, “Waves formed the city made of sand”, but they would say “Tiny pieces of matter, namely the atoms, came together by chance and they formed the sun, stars and earth all by themselves.” 
A meteor entering the atmosphere shrinks through combustion. 
We can compare the atoms to marbles. 
In all the places in which you go about and all the corners that you turn, there are atoms. 
But cells are the building blocks of humans, ants, cats, roses, trees, and all other living organisms around you. 
Look at your brother. 
Your brother started out as a single cell in your mother’s abdomen. 
After this, the cells continued to divide and the same information duplication happened in all of them, resulting in many cells with the same information. 
You probably have thought about why cells took on different tasks or how they were able to combine in such a neat shape. 
Cells are tiny beings that are invisible to the naked eye. 
Allah shows great mercy to you and gives you many blessings. 
How much do you know about this body of yours, which works nonstop and repairs itself when it runs down? 
You wouldn’t be able to see all the beautiful things. 
You wouldn’t be able to imagine what a rabbit or a dog looks like, because you would never have seen one. 
However, none of this equipment gives as clear a view as your eyes do. 
Isn’t your vision clear? 
Even if you turn on the best of stereos, you hear some crackling and hissing sounds. 
Your heart, which is about the size of your fist, continues this action throughout your life without becoming tired or even stopping once. 
One of these living things is the human being. 
We told you earlier how the human being was created. 
In this section, we will explain the amazing features of some of these animals and plants. 
Whatever she does, she will not be able to prevent the mosquito from biting. 
In this way, human beings should realise that they have absolutely no power in front of Allah. 
Now, think about yourself. 
This is the buzz of a mosquito. 
After learning this, you will probably view mosquitoes with different eyes. 
She gives her eggs this shape because, since they have been left on water, the eggs could easily sink. 
The white eggs that the mother lines up with care immediately begin to darken. 
It looks like the diver’s snorkel the child in the next picture is using. 
As you can see, Allah does not protect just you, He also protects all other living creatures. 
But first, he must get out of the shell. 
However, the head portion of the cocoon is covered with a special sticky substance that prevents the head of the mosquito from coming into contact with water. 
This is a very important moment, because the mosquito must stand on water on the tips of its feet, and it must not wet its wings. 
The mosquito manages this with great skill, because Allah created him with this talent. 
Due to this, scientists were able to invent a camera that captures images by means of heat. 
People copying a small mosquito! 
The technique that the mosquito uses to suck blood is so meticulous that it astonishes people. 
If this were so, the mosquito would not have existed, because none of the mosquitoes would have been able to feed protein to their eggs. 
First, it anaesthetises and then it sucks. 
If a mosquito is able to continue its life, for example, then this is because Allah is protecting it. 
Allah neither misses anything, nor does He forget. 
Stop here and think for a moment. 
The machines that are able to fly today were developed only during the last century. 
Now, this question may have occurred to you: Who teaches the fly all these moves? 
You will probably reply, “yes!” 
A worker bee lives between 4 to 6 weeks. For 3 weeks after its birth it lives inside the hive. 
During their brief lives, the bees work nonstop. 
In addition, no one teaches them the work that they are supposed to do. 
After flying about all day long, they find their own source and take with them as much royal jelly as they can, and then they return to their hive. 
Allah says in a verse in the Qur’an: 
Unlike other creatures, it is not the female penguin that incubates the eggs but the male. 
They come close to each other, forming a circle, and in this way, they warm each other up. 
This is because Allah has also created their bodies very differently from ours. 
Even with their small size, the bee hummingbirds travel very long distances and during this trip, they flap their wings around two and a half million times. 
Flying fish don’t fly with wings like birds, but they slide on fins that resemble a bird’s wings. 
In this way, they slide swiftly in water. 
The uniqueness of the ostrich is its ability to run only on its big toe. 
These flaps curl up when it walks on land. 
Meanwhile, the flaps on the back of its feet open and provide it the width that will allow it to run on water. 
There are thousands of animals on earth like these that you might not have seen or heard of yet. 
Well, could all these animals have achieved such interesting features by chance? 
Of course not! 
During the summer, juicy fruits such as watermelons, cherries, cantaloupe and peaches come out. 
No fruit could decide its scent. 
We asked, “How could all of these have occurred?” 
Obviously, Allah has created all of them. 
It is very easy for Allah to create all of these, because He is very Powerful. 
It is just like saying, “No one baked that cake in the kitchen; it baked itself by accident”. 
They mixed in just the right proportions. 
If there is someone baking the cake, then there is a very Intelligent Being Who has created the sun and humans. 
These people try to confuse others by saying things that are not true. 
The people who believe in the theory of evolution are called “evolutionists”. 
This means, according to Darwin, that one day, fish turned into reptiles by chance. 
This means that in reality, you are made up of billions of atoms that have come together. 
Allow them to put inside this barrel all the atoms that they wish. 
(They can pass the task to younger evolutionists, as their lifetimes would not be enough.) 
The events we have mentioned until this moment are correct, but they have nothing to do with evolution. 
This is wrong, because no matter how fast a deer runs, or how long it extends its neck upward, it cannot turn into another creature, a lion or a giraffe, for example. 
This can only happen in fairy tales. 
There was an explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, and this caused radiation to spread over the whole city, surrounding areas and even as far as Western Europe. 
This claim is nonsense. 
If mutations were beneficial, when the radiation leak occurred, everyone would have gone to Chernobyl to evolve into more advanced beings. 
Thus, we can learn about creatures that lived long ago. 
(It is impossible for something like this to happen but we are just putting together a scenario!). 
The whole universe, planets, stars and our own earth were formed after this enormous explosion. 
Well, do you know when the first living creatures appeared? 
No fossil hunter (palaeontologist) has ever come across such a transitional form. 
Again, they would all die! 
Something like this is impossible! It can never be possible because there are a lot of differences between fish and land creatures and all of these changes cannot just happen suddenly by coincidence. 
However, on land they cannot breathe with their gills and so they would die. 
Probably they found kidneys lying somewhere when they decided to go on land! 
Furthermore, it wasn’t preparing to come ashore, as evolutionists claim. 
Things like this only happen in stories or in cartoons. 
It can flap its wings 500 to 1000 times per second. 
THE ARCHAEOPTERYX, WHICH EVOLUTIONISTS CALL A TRANSITIONAL FORM, IS IN FACT A COMPLETE BIRD! 
The Archaeopteryx had the same chestbone, to which its wings were attached, as other flying birds. 
Then how did sea mammals develop? 
Their aim is to make people forget Allah, and for this reason they tell everyone, “Allah did not create you. 
EVOLUTIONISTS CANNOT SHOW ANY PROOF THAT HUMANS CAME FROM APES 
In the field of science, it is very important to produce “proof”. 
That meant that there is a force pulling the apple to the ground and he called it “gravity”. 
However, such a fossil has not been discovered until today. 
However, evolutionists try to trick people with their theories. 
You see, by drawing such pictures, evolutionists try to confuse people. 
As we stated earlier, not one fossil has been found to prove it. 
There are people belonging to different ethnic groups such as the Africans, Chinese, Red Indians, Turks, Europeans, Arabs and many others. 
When you see a Red Indian or an Eskimo, you immediately know that they belong to a different ethnic group. 
Afterwards, a picture of a creature imagined to exist between man and the apes was drawn taking this single tooth as basis. 
Moreover, the era during which these people lived is an era in which evolutionists claim that humans were still not formed. 
This makes total nonsense of evolutionists’ claims such as that humans evolved from apes, and that first there was primitive man (half human, half ape) who then evolved into today’s mankind. 
One of the oldest fossils found to date is that of the Turkana Boy, which is about 1.6 million years old. 
These claims made by the theory of evolution are not based on any scientific evidence but are rather based on total imagination. 
The reason that evolutionists claim that the humans have originated from apes is the physical resemblance between the two. 
If just one of them, for example the lens, were missing, the eye could not function. 
If all of its pieces were together but the gas pedal was missing, you would not be able to drive it. 
The eye’s structure is much more complicated and flawless than that of a car. 
These four chemicals aligned in different combinations can form different data. 
However, all this knowledge has been fitted into a tiny molecule that we can’t even see with our eyes. 
Or rather, would you think that they were written by educated scholars and professors, and then published by a book company? 
Obviously, the latter is the logically correct answer. 
If He had not given us these faculties, we would not have been able to taste the things that we eat. 
You like some things, and you enjoy them and think of them as fun. 
It could be a dessert that you enjoy eating, a game that you enjoy playing, or an outing with people you love. 
To begin with, you did not exist. 
You were nothing. 
Then we must be grateful to Allah for each moment of our lives. 
For the most part they were all timid people—of course, they were petitioners. 
I was lying from spite. 
I was simply amusing myself with the petitioners and with the officer, and in reality I never could become spiteful. 
I knew that they had been swarming in me all my life and craving some outlet from me, but I would not let them, would not let them, purposely would not let them come out. 
That is my conviction of forty years. 
For man’s everyday needs, it would have been quite enough to have the ordinary human consciousness, that is, half or a quarter of the amount which falls to the lot of a cultivated man of our unhappy nineteenth century, especially one who has the fatal illluck to inhabit Petersburg, the most theoretical and intentional town on the whole terrestrial globe. (There are intentional and unintentional towns.) 
I did not believe it was the same with other people, and all my life I hid this fact about myself as a secret. 
About that in particular I want to say a few words. 
III With people who know how to revenge themselves and to stand up for themselves in general, how is it done? 
Let us suppose, for instance, that it feels insulted, too (and it almost always does feel insulted), and wants to revenge itself, too. There may even be a greater accumulation of spite in it than in L’HOMME DE LA NATURE ET DE LA VERITE. 
Apart from the one fundamental nastiness the luckless mouse succeeds in creating around it so many other nastinesses in the form of doubts and questions, adds to the one question so many unsettled questions that there inevitably works up around it a sort of fatal brew, a stinking mess, made up of its doubts, emotions, and of the contempt spat upon it by the direct men of action who stand solemnly about it as judges and arbitrators, laughing at it till their healthy sides ache. 
Of course the only thing left for it is to dismiss all that with a wave of its paw, and, with a smile of assumed contempt in which it does not even itself believe, creep ignominiously into its mousehole. 
But it is just in that cold, abominable half despair, half belief, in that conscious burying oneself alive for grief in the underworld for forty years, in that acutely recognised and yet partly doubtful hopelessness of one’s position, in that hell of unsatisfied desires turned inward, in that fever of oscillations, of resolutions determined for ever and repented of again a minute later—that the savour of that strange enjoyment of which I have spoken lies. 
But enough ... not another word on that subject of such extreme interest to you. 
Why, of course, the laws of nature, the deductions of natural science, mathematics. 
As though such a stone wall really were a consolation, and really did contain some word of conciliation, simply because it is as true as twice two makes four. 
It is a good example, gentlemen, and I will develop it. 
His moans become nasty, disgustingly malignant, and go on for whole days and nights. 
At the same time I was genuinely touched and penitent, I used to shed tears and, of course, deceived myself, though I was not acting in the least and there was a sick feeling in my heart at the time.... 
I repeat, I repeat with emphasis: all “direct” persons and men of action are active just because they are stupid and limited. 
I will tell you: in consequence of their limitation they take immediate and secondary causes for primary ones, and in that way persuade themselves more quickly and easily than other people do that they have found an infallible foundation for their activity, and their minds are at ease and you know that is the chief thing. 
(I am sure you did not take it in.) I said that a man revenges himself because he sees justice in it. 
But I see no justice in it, I find no sort of virtue in it either, and consequently if I attempt to revenge myself, it is only out of spite. 
But what is to be done if I have not even spite (I began with that just now, you know). 
Oh, gentlemen, do you know, perhaps I consider myself an intelligent man, only because all my life I have been able neither to begin nor to finish anything. 
I should have respected myself because I should at least have been capable of being lazy; there would at least have been one quality, as it were, positive in me, in which I could have believed myself. 
I should have found for myself a form of activity in keeping with it, to be precise, drinking to the health of everything “sublime and beautiful.” 
I should have snatched at every opportunity to drop a tear into my glass and then to drain it to all that is “sublime and beautiful.” 
And what a good round belly I should have grown, what a treble chin I should have established, what a ruby nose I should have coloured for myself, so that everyone would have said, looking at me: “Here is an asset! 
And, say what you like, it is very agreeable to hear such remarks about oneself in this negative age. 
The fact is, gentlemen, it seems there must really exist something that is dearer to almost every man than his greatest advantages, or (not to be illogical) there is a most advantageous advantage (the very one omitted of which we spoke just now) which is more important and more advantageous than all other advantages, for the sake of which a man if necessary is ready to act in opposition to all laws; that is, in opposition to reason, honour, peace, prosperity—in fact, in opposition to all those excellent and useful things if only he can attain that fundamental, most advantageous advantage which is dearer to him than all. 
Why, to maintain this theory of the regeneration of mankind by means of the pursuit of his own advantage is to my mind almost the same thing ... as to affirm, for instance, following Buckle, that through civilisation mankind becomes softer, and consequently less bloodthirsty and less fitted for warfare. 
I take this example because it is the most glaring instance of it. 
Take the farce of SchleswigHolstein .... 
In old days he saw justice in bloodshed and with his conscience at peace exterminated those he thought proper. Now we do think bloodshed abominable and yet we engage in this abomination, and with more energy than ever. 
Consequently we have only to discover these laws of nature, and man will no longer have to answer for his actions and life will become exceedingly easy for him. 
Then—this is all what you say—new economic relations will be established, all readymade and worked out with mathematical exactitude, so that every possible question will vanish in the twinkling of an eye, simply because every possible answer to it will be provided. 
“Science has succeeded in so far analysing man that we know already that choice and what is called freedom of will is nothing else than—“ Stay, gentlemen, I meant to begin with that myself I confess, I was rather frightened. 
If, for instance, some day they calculate and prove to me that I made a long nose at someone because I could not help making a long nose at him and that I had to do it in that particular way, what FREEDOM is left me, especially if I am a learned man and have taken my degree somewhere? 
Then I should be able to calculate my whole life for thirty years beforehand. In short, if this could be arranged there would be nothing left for us to do; anyway, we should have to understand that. 
In short, one may say anything about the history of the world—anything that might enter the most disordered imagination. The only thing one can’t say is that it’s rational. 
And that is not all: even if man really were nothing but a pianokey, even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of simple ingratitude, simply to gain his point. 
And if he does not find means he will contrive destruction and chaos, will contrive sufferings of all sorts, only to gain his point! 
But while I am alive and have desires I would rather my hand were withered off than bring one brick to such a building! Don’t remind me that I have just rejected the palace of crystal for the sole reason that one cannot put out one’s tongue at it. 
You declare that you are afraid of nothing and at the same time try to ingratiate yourself in our good opinion. 
And another problem: why do I call you “gentlemen,” why do I address you as though you really were my readers? 
Now, when I am not only recalling them, but have actually decided to write an account of them, I want to try the experiment whether one can, even with oneself, be perfectly open and not take fright at the whole truth. 
Quite so; but yet it is more imposing on paper. 
It came back vividly to my mind a few days ago, and has remained haunting me like an annoying tune that one cannot get rid of. 
I believe I should not have dared to look at anyone with such an unsightly countenance. 
Another had such a very dirty old uniform that there was an unpleasant odour in his proximity. 
And what a faculty they have for the most contradictory sensations! 
It is not a poor material! 
I do not say this from any foolish or boastful patriotism. 
At other times I should have felt very much disgusted, but I was in such a mood at the time, that I actually envied the gentleman thrown out of the window—and I envied him so much that I even went into the tavern and into the billiardroom. 
Only fancy, this was two years after his insult to me, and my challenge would have been a ridiculous anachronism, in spite of all the ingenuity of my letter in disguising and explaining away the anachronism. 
And all at once I revenged myself in the simplest way, by a stroke of genius! A brilliant thought suddenly dawned upon me. 
I had got ready long beforehand a good shirt, with white bone studs; my overcoat was the only thing that held me back. 
He never lent money to anyone, but I had, on entering the service, been specially recommended to him by an important personage who had got me my berth. 
In this way everything was at last ready. 
The officer was afterwards transferred; I have not seen him now for fourteen years. 
I could not even picture him before me then. 
No, I had a lofty way of getting out of it all. 
I had to call on Anton Antonitch, however, on Tuesday—his athome day; so I had always to time my passionate desire to embrace humanity so that it might fall on a Tuesday. 
I had the patience to sit like a fool beside these people for four hours at a stretch, listening to them without knowing what to say to them or venturing to say a word. 
He was evidently uncomfortable at these reminiscences, and was, I fancy, always afraid that I might take up the same tone again. 
They were engaged in warm and earnest conversation about a farewell dinner which they wanted to arrange for the next day to a comrade of theirs called Zverkov, an officer in the army, who was going away to a distant province. 
And it was not from any interested motive that they grovelled, but simply because he had been favoured by the gifts of nature. 
I remained angrily and contemptuously silent and would not answer him. 
When we left school he made advances to me; I did not rebuff them, for I was flattered, but we soon parted and quite naturally. 
How twentyone roubles?” I asked in some agitation, with a show of being offended; “if you count me it will not be twentyone, but twentyeight roubles.” 
Do you want to join, too?” Simonov observed, with no appearance of pleasure, seeming to avoid looking at me. 
He knew me through and through. 
Oh, there’s no making you out ... with these refinements,” Trudolyubov jeered. 
“Tomorrow at fiveo’clock at the Hotel de Paris.” 
Will you pay your subscription now? 
I was sent to the school by distant relations, upon whom I was dependent and of whom I have heard nothing since—they sent me there a forlorn, silent boy, already crushed by their reproaches, already troubled by doubt, and looking with savage distrust at everyone. 
But by then I did not desire their affection: on the contrary, I continually longed for their humiliation. 
After a good many questions I elicited from the waiters that the dinner had been ordered not for five, but for six o’clock. 
Zverkov cried ironically, for to his notions this was bound to be extremely funny. 
It was a round table. 
In my novel surroundings I was unnaturally ready to be irritated. 
Yes, you can’t afford to dine at cafes on that,” Ferfitchkin added insolently. 
Oh, spare his blushes,” cried Ferfitchkin, sniggering. 
Have you gone out of your wits in your office?” 
But they seemed to have forgotten me altogether. 
Simonov made haste to fill up the glasses with champagne. 
I want to make a speech separately, on my own account ... and then I’ll drink it, Mr. Trudolyubov.” 
I drew myself up in my chair and feverishly seized my glass, prepared for something extraordinary, though I did not know myself precisely what I was going to say. 
I went on almost mechanically, for I was beginning to shiver with horror myself and had no idea how I came to be talking like this. 
He was frightfully offended and turned pale. 
But probably I was so ridiculous as I challenged him and it was so out of keeping with my appearance that everyone including Ferfitchkin was prostrate with laughter. 
I will go on sitting and drinking, because this is a publichouse and I paid my entrance money. 
I simply tried not to look at any of them. 
The waiter who came into the room stopped, from time to time, to look at me. 
Once—only once—they turned towards me, just when Zverkov was talking about Shakespeare, and I suddenly gave a contemptuous laugh. 
Friends,” cried Zverkov getting up from the sofa, “let us all be off now, THERE!” Of course, of course,” the others assented. 
You are a scoundrel,” a thought flashed through my mind, “if you laugh at this now.” 
No matter!” I cried, answering myself. 
“Now everything is lost!” 
I made a rush for the roughly made sledge; but as soon as I raised my foot to get into it, the recollection of how Simonov had just given me six roubles seemed to double me up and I tumbled into the sledge like a sack. 
That is a mirage, cheap mirage, revolting, romantic and fantastical—that’s another ball on Lake Como. 
That’s most likely, indeed. 
But where can I get pistols? 
“It’s of no consequence! 
But no, it’s impossible. 
I have come to discharge my pistol and ... and I ... forgive you. 
I was actually on the point of tears, though I knew perfectly well at that moment that all this was out of Pushkin’s SILVIO and Lermontov’s MASQUERADE. 
At last we arrived. 
“Where are they?” I asked somebody. 
I felt as though I had been saved from death and was conscious of this, joyfully, all over: I should have given that slap, I should certainly, certainly have given it! 
She was very simply dressed. 
My harassed face struck me as revolting in the extreme, pale, angry, abject, with dishevelled hair. 
Now I suddenly realised vividly the hideous idea—revolting as a spider—of vice, which, without love, grossly and shamelessly begins with that in which true love finds its consummation. 
Twenty.” 
I saw them carrying a coffin out yesterday and they nearly dropped it,” I suddenly said aloud, not that I desired to open the conversation, but as it were by accident. 
Oh, you know ... down below ... from a house of illfame. 
And there must have been water in the grave.” 
I’ve seen it myself ... many times.” 
But why should I die?” she answered, as though defending herself. 
She died of consumption.” 
She was in debt to her madam,” I retorted, more and more provoked by the discussion; “and went on earning money for her up to the end, though she was in consumption. 
No doubt they knew her. 
They were laughing. 
But after another year of this life you will be very different—you will go off.” 
I don’t think anything.” 
That’s what’s wrong, that you don’t think. 
Even in sorrow life is sweet; life is sweet, however one lives. 
She turned her head nearer to me, and it seemed to me in the darkness that she propped herself on her arm. 
Why so?” she asked. 
Ah! so she was listening! 
That is always so. 
You know that you may torment a man on purpose through love. 
Then there are some women who are jealous. 
If he went off anywhere—I knew one such woman, she couldn’t restrain herself, but would jump up at night and run off on the sly to find out where he was, whether he was with some other woman. 
A plump little rosy baby, sprawling and snuggling, chubby little hands and feet, clean tiny little nails, so tiny that it makes one laugh to look at them; eyes that look as if they understand everything. 
When its father comes up, the child tears itself away from the bosom, flings itself back, looks at its father, laughs, as though it were fearfully funny, and falls to sucking again. Or it will bite its mother’s breast when its little teeth are coming, while it looks sideways at her with its little eyes as though to say, ‘Look, I am biting!’ 
Can you seriously think that you will never grow old, that you will always be goodlooking, and that they will keep you here for ever and ever? 
I say nothing of the loathsomeness of the life here .... 
How can he love you when he knows you may be called away from him any minute? 
Ask him, if you have got one, whether he will marry you. 
You don’t believe that you will ever be like that? 
No, Liza, it would be happy for you if you were to die soon of consumption in some corner, in some cellar like that woman just now. 
Don’t doubt it, that’s how it is; you have sold your soul, and what is more you owe money, so you daren’t say a word. 
When you die, strange hands will lay you out, with grumbling and impatience; no one will bless you, no one will sigh for you, they only want to get rid of you as soon as may be; they will buy a coffin, take you to the grave as they did that poor woman today, and celebrate your memory at the tavern. 
It was dark; though I tried my best I could not finish dressing quickly. 
Suddenly I felt a box of matches and a candlestick with a whole candle in it. 
As she ran away she flushed, her eyes shone, and there was a smile on her lips—what was the meaning of it? 
In fact, it was not the same face, not the same look as the evening before: sullen, mistrustful and obstinate. 
When I had finished reading it I met her glowing, questioning, and childishly impatient eyes fixed upon me. 
She fastened her eyes upon my face and waited impatiently for what I should say. 
In a few words, hurriedly, but with a sort of joy and pride, she explained to me that she had been to a dance somewhere in a private house, a family of “very nice people, WHO KNEW NOTHING, absolutely nothing, for she had only come here so lately and it had all happened ... and she hadn’t made up her mind to stay and was certainly going away as soon as she had paid her debt...” and at that party there had been the student who had danced with her all the evening. 
She dropped her shining eyes with a sort of bashfulness as she finished. 
Let her come, though; it doesn’t matter .... 
On reaching home I promptly wrote to Simonov. 
When he learned that there was money in the letter, Apollon became more respectful and agreed to take it. 
Something was not dead within me, in the depths of my heart and conscience it would not die, and it showed itself in acute depression. 
On this occasion the jostling of the streets irritated me more than ever, I could not make out what was wrong with me, I could not find the clue, something seemed rising up continually in my soul, painfully, and refusing to be appeased. 
He will fasten upon her in order to be rude to me. 
Oh, the beastliness! 
What I wanted was to excite an honourable feeling in her .... 
Her crying was a good thing, it will have a good effect.” 
But, however, “Liza will very likely come all the same,” was the refrain with which all my reflections ended. I was so uneasy that I sometimes flew into a fury: “She’ll come, she is certain to come!” 
The damnable romanticism of these pure hearts! 
Why, how fail to understand? 
But for some unknown reason he despised me beyond all measure, and looked down upon me insufferably. 
He was in love with every button on his coat, every nail on his fingers—absolutely in love with them, and he looked it! 
In his behaviour to me he was a perfect tyrant, he spoke very little to me, and if he chanced to glance at me he gave me a firm, majestically selfconfident and invariably ironical look that drove me sometimes to fury. 
He consented to do nothing for me for seven roubles a month. 
He spoke in a slow, measured tone, with his hands behind his back and his eyes fixed on the ground. 
He maddened me particularly when he read aloud the psalms to himself behind his partition. 
I could not live in furnished lodgings: my lodging was my private solitude, my shell, my cave, in which I concealed myself from all mankind, and Apollon seemed to me, for some reason, an integral part of that flat, and for seven years I could not turn him away. 
I purposed to say nothing to him about it, and was purposely silent indeed, in order to score off his pride and force him to be the first to speak of his wages. 
This time the usual staring manoeuvres had scarcely begun when I lost my temper and flew at him in a fury. 
He would not go away, but stared at us sarcastically. 
After standing over us for a couple of minutes Apollon went away, but that did not make me more at ease. 
What made it worse was that she, too, was overwhelmed with confusion, more so, in fact, than I should have expected. 
Apollon, who had already sat down to his work and put on his spectacles again, at first glanced askance at the money without speaking or putting down his needle; then, without paying the slightest attention to me or making any answer, he went on busying himself with his needle, which he had not yet threaded. 
My temples were moist with sweat. I was pale, I felt it. 
She looked at me uneasily. 
It was an hysterical attack. 
I began, gasping for breath and regardless of logical connection in my words. 
I longed to have it all out at once, at one burst; I did not even trouble how to begin. 
Answer, answer,” I cried, hardly knowing what I was doing. 
“Save you from what? 
Why didn’t you throw it in my teeth when I was giving you that sermon: ‘But what did you come here yourself for? was it to read us a sermon?’ 
Of course, I couldn’t keep it up then, because I am a wretched creature, I was frightened, and, the devil knows why, gave you my address in my folly. 
That I posed as such a hero to you, and now you would see me in a wretched torn dressinggown, beggarly, loathsome. 
Do you understand? How I shall hate you now after saying this, for having been here and listening. Why, it’s not once in a lifetime a man speaks out like this, and then it is in hysterics! ... 
What happened was this: Liza, insulted and crushed by me, understood a great deal more than I imagined. 
When I began calling myself a scoundrel and a blackguard and my tears flowed (the tirade was accompanied throughout by tears) her whole face worked convulsively. 
I, too, could not restrain myself, and sobbed as I never had before. 
Why was I ashamed? I don’t know, but I was ashamed. 
She was sitting on the ground with her head leaning against the bed, and must have been crying. 
I know I shall be told that this is incredible—but it is incredible to be as spiteful and stupid as I was; it may be added that it was strange I should not love her, or at any rate, appreciate her love. 
But several minutes passed and she still remained, without stirring, as though she were unconscious. 
It was the same note; it could be no other, there was no other in the flat. So she had managed to fling it from her hand on the table at the moment when I had dashed into the further corner. 
I could not endure it. 
Should I not torture her? 
“Will it not be better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for ever? 
It would be the worse for us if our petulant prayers were answered. Come, try, give any one of us, for instance, a little more independence, untie our hands, widen the spheres of our activity, relax the control and we ... yes, I assure you ... we should be begging to be under control again at once. 
Leave us alone without books and we shall be lost and in confusion at once. 
We are oppressed at being men—men with a real individual body and blood, we are ashamed of it, we think it a disgrace and try to contrive to be some sort of impossible generalised man. 
However, prosperity and power alone are not enough to save those people and to make this world a place of welfare in which justice, peace, confidence and wellbeing prevail. 
Only being conscientious will channel resources and power towards the welfare of the poor and desperate. 
It is only the believers who constantly live by their consciences. 
By it, Allah guides those who follow what pleases Him to the ways of peace. He will bring them from the darkness to the light by His permission, and guide them to a straight path. 
As you read this passage, millions of people are suffering, are cold and hungry, or facing expulsion from their homelands. 
So woe to those who do salat (regular prayers), whose hearts from their salat are remote, those who show off and deny help to others. 
To feed one's self, to find a house in which to reside, to set up a family, and to have a job are the praised values to which one mostly aspires. 
Yet, for a person without purpose or an outlook on the world, the existence of certain ideas will surely have no meaning. 
The purpose of this life is to strive to be a person of whom Allah approves and whom He will host in His Garden. 
Being aware that our purpose in the world is to earn Allah's approval, favour and the Garden, we cannot remain indifferent or insensitive to any event taking place around us. 
Having seen these horrible scenes, however, people can still go to sleep and go on with their usual lives since they personally come to no harm. 
Yet, the more people become distant from the Qur'an, the more they show insensitivity of conscience. 
Allah relates the selfish, insensitive and brutal conduct of people who lack religion as follows; 
Any who disbelieve after that, such people are deviators. 
Someone, who readily kills a human being, for instance, for no apparent reason or for a worldly interest, does this because he does not fear Allah. 
Then every self will be paid in full for what it earned. 
Allah states this in the following verse: 
They fulfil their vows and fear a day whose evil will spread far and wide. 
In case the situation turns out to be otherwise, people deliberately commit themselves to a cruel system. 
The likeness of those who disbelieve is that of someone who yells out to something which cannot hear – it is nothing but a cry and a call. 
The following example will contribute to a better understanding: a person, who believes that swindling is a horrible crime, will strictly avoid it throughout his life. 
Meanwhile, he may find refuge in some excuse: that conditions compelled him or his responsibilities to his family laid the ground for such a crime… No matter what these excuses are, the fact remains that slander is wicked under all circumstances. 
You who have iman! Show integrity for the sake of Allah, bearing witness with justice. 
Under any circumstances, be it under threat or duress, or in the presence of anything of benefit to them, they never tend to mischief, being aware that Allah surrounds them at every moment. 
In one verse, Allah proclaims that the slaves of the AllMerciful do not bear false witness: 
In these societies, all strata are saturated with this mentality, giving us an abundance of examples to analyse. 
This tendency explains why there are limited opportunities available to women in business life. 
This attitude maintains courtesy after a divorce. There are many measures taken in the Qur'an securing a woman's rights after divorce. 
…Give them a gift – he who is wealthy according to his means and he who is less well off according to his means – a gift to be given with correctness and courtesy: a duty for all gooddoers. 
Today, all individuals around the world do not have equal access to resources. 
In rich countries, some resources no longer in use remain idle even though they could be transferred to poor countries. 
Associations are set up to organise this aid. However, these associations lack credibility, since they are often full of corruption. 
The basic Qur'anic teachings command matters such as cooperation and mercy, which are the essence of a just society. In such a society, everyone safeguards each other's interests and thus the rights and interests of all are secured. 
Thus, it is essential that he is fair in his decisions, makes no prejudicial discrimination against people, correctly identifies the needy and devises pertinent actions addressing their problems. 
Politicians being "guided" by this fear, adopt policies suiting the best interests of these interest groups or they create artificial crises. Sometimes political parties suffer intraparty clashes. 
For politicians and parties alike, vested interests and political preferences always take precedence. 
People, who do not conduct themselves responsibly and conscientiously, do not fear Allah. They do not show mercy to people and act fairly for the same reason. 
The majority of people in the world live on the breadline while many countries depend on foreign 'aid' for survival. 
Even so, hundreds of candidates apply for a few vacancies in public service, which will bring a rather moderate income. 
What is the solution, then? 
When we add the number of dependants to this figure, the dimensions of the problem become even more serious. 
But Allah has permitted trade and He has forbidden usury. 
In another verse, it is stressed that usury does not bring prosperity to man: 
To improve living standards, stability and order are essential in all domains of social life. This also holds true for the economy. 
To fulfil it, one primarily needs to communicate the religion and the blessings that the religion adds to one's life. 
The world agenda is dominated by children who make their living on streets collecting trash, who spend freezing nights out on the streets and have dangerous jobs in return for which they receive little money, risking their lives. So, much of the world is not safe from the child deaths stemming from malnutrition and other povertylinked problems. 
In Africa, this figure is estimated to be 5 million and is steadily increasing. 
One of the important consequences of world poverty is the refugee problem. 
Malaysia, for instance, forced veteran foreign workers within her borders to leave. These people, who arrived in Malaysia with the hope of a better life, had to return to their home countries after years of service. 
Such people are the truly sincere. 
Woe that Day to the deniers: those who deny the Day of Reckoning. 
These people, who have drifted from the religion aspire to possess more and they instil this ambition into the minds of others around them, predisposing them to disobey the limits of Allah. 
We are living in a time when those who have entirely abandoned religious values are in the majority. Not content with what they personally do, these people are willing also to cause others to drift along this dark path. 
Disbelief actually lays the basis of this inclination. This rationale maintains that human beings came into existence as a result of chance and that thus man does not have to feel responsible toward his Creator. 
Indeed, renowned materialists and advocates of Darwinism clearly express how disbelief sees moral values. 
This is why disbelief is the foremost reason accounting for moral degeneration, as is also affirmed by the aforementioned words of W. Provine. 
As is also stressed in this verse, the generations who are born to disbelieving people become irreligious and devoid of moral values like their parents. 
Yet, there may be people claiming to be moral, albeit disbelieving. They assert they do not get involved in any of the aforementioned immoral behaviour. 
A disbelieving person, who claims he has never received bribes, can readily lie if it serves his interests. 
(Surat alBaqara: 268) As indicated in the verse, because of the fear of impoverishment, a majority of people dare to indulge in all forms of immorality. 
On the other hand, even the thought of living immorally does not occur to the mind of a person hoping to earn the mercy of Allah. 
In one verse, Allah stresses that the fear of Allah that believers have makes them strive with good character: 
That societies tend to such degradation is a token of their imprudence. 
He needs substantial sums of money for drugs, yet, paradoxically, drugs physically hinder him from working. 
At this stage, the addict starts to make his or her living outside the law, stealing, cheating, in heterosexual or homosexual prostitution, etc. 
Meanwhile, many magazines and press organs instil into our minds that homosexuality is a popular and acceptable way of life. 
Allah, in the Qur'an, proclaims that the cities of the people who disobeyed the prophet Lut were razed to the ground because they practised homosexuality, a disaster which went down in history. 
On the other hand, in a believing society people strive for what is better, more honourable, more aesthetic and honest. 
In our day, gambling blights societies. Nevertheless, gambling continues to be one of the most profitable sectors. 
There are people who kill taxi cabdrivers at midnight for a handful of money. 
These people do not have fear of Allah and, furthermore, they raise cruel offspring having no fear of Allah. 
Nuh said, 'My Lord! do not leave a single one of the disbelievers on earth! 
In the Qur'an, the period of the Pharaoh is related as a period similar to this era. 
The reason why people become cruel, to the extent of committing violent mass murders or massacres, is actually because of the mentality they imbibe from their leaders. 
We made them leaders, summoning to the Fire, and on the Day of Rising they will not be helped. 
The theory of evolution advocated by materialist philosophers is the pillar on which this distorted understanding is founded. 
Causes of War 
Totally bereft of all humane qualities such as compassion, mercy and the ability to cooperate, such people only pursue their personal greed and strive to satisfy their cravings for leadership. In the words of the Qur'an, this character is described as follows: 
Often, violation of one country's rights by another becomes the reason why a country wages war on another. A war declared for an acre of land usually sets in train the irreversible momentum towards ruin for every country. 
Such people will have a painful punishment. 
Believers should tell all people of the bliss, joy and sense of security and trust the religion grants man. 
Allah informs us in the Qur'an that once truth is revealed, falsehood is doomed to vanish: Rather We hurl the truth against falsehood and it cuts right through it and it vanishes clean away! 
In the following pages, considerable space will be devoted to some of the troubled countries plagued with conflict. The stress given to these countries, however, does not serve merely informative purposes. 
For such purposes, there are thousands of books, tens of thousands of reports available. 
Nobody must think that these conflicts, which lay waste many a country, are far away and that thus they are incapable of doing anything. 
Dagestan is a neighbour of Chechnya, densely populated with Muslims (80%). 
The pain has not ended yet; in cavelike shelters, many people currently live under very difficult conditions. 
The camp accommodated 214 families, with a total of 1110 members. 
A pot boiling on a fire kindled with a few dry branches. 
I did not have the courage to open the pot to see if there was anything inside. 
Ethnic Cleansing in Kosovo 
Kosovo, a region with a Muslim majority, remained under Ottoman rule until the Balkan War of 1912. 
In the war launched by Serbs on April 1992, the plan was to annihilate Muslims in a few weeks or force them to emigrate. 
Serbs killed more than two hundred thousand Bosnian Muslims, forced two million people out of their homes and raped more than fifty thousand Muslim women. In Serbian concentration camps, Muslims were subjected to unbearable torture, tens of thousands became disabled…What is most striking is that the Serbs who committed such cruelty and the Bosnians, the focus of Serbian rage, are of the same race and speak the same language. 
Life is as precarious for Muslims in Indonesia, an archipelago in Far East, as it is for many other people facing war around the globe. 
In Indonesia, a former Dutch colony, the rule of the country has always been in the hands of people of Javanese origin, who make up 7% of the population. 
Upon this, the ruling elite declared the Muslims traitors and subjected them to mass executions. 
By 1998, the year when Suharto became president for the seventh time, corruption was already endemic in Indonesia with Suharto employing nepotism to maximum advantage. 
The military administration endeavoured to put down this revolt by gunfire and they massacred thousands of people. 
A Muslim Community Whose Ties with the Entire World have been broken: Uigur Turks in Eastern 
Eastern Turkestan is for many probably a littleknown country. 
Muslim people who resisted the assimilation policies of China were brutally massacred and their rights denied. 
People were buried alive and women raped… In 1953, Muslims represented 75% of the population while the Chinese made up 6%. In 1990, however, this state of affairs reversed in favour of the Chinese. The Chinese population constituted 53% while Muslim population fell to 40%. 
With payrises and selective promotions, Marcos made the armed forces his personal political machine, suspended implementation of the constitutional law and replaced it with martial law. 
The Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) fought on behalf of the Muslims and in bloody clashes more than fifty thousand Muslims, the majority of whom were civilians, lost their lives. 
These were ferocious guerrillas, who went to great lengths in violence, such as breaking the skulls of their victims or drinking their blood. They employed special torture techniques for every victim and, after murdering, confiscated all property. 
Clashes, wars and massacres reflect little of what civilians suffered throughout the Israeli invasion. 
The Phalange Party's establishment of its political power through the support of Israel was the beginning of a bloody war that was to devastate Beirut. 
Those who are disbelievers filled their hearts with fanatical ragethe fanatical rage of the Time of Ignorance – and Allah sent down serenity to His Messenger and to the believers, and bound them to the expression of taqwa which they had most right to and were most entitled to. 
Darwin made his views about the origins of human beings clear in his book The Descent of Man published in 1871. 
In this struggle, the strong always defeat the weak and thus progress occurs. 
Darwin maintained that this "struggle for survival" is also true for human races. 
After Hitler took power, he incorporated these views of Haeckel's into official policy, which resulted in the immediate internment in special centres of the mentally disturbed, the disabled, the blind and those having inherited diseases. 
After keeping these categories of men isolated from society for a while, Nazis arrogated to themselves the right to murder them secretly upon a confidential order by Hitler. 
The way Musa addressed Pharaoh shows clearly his faith in Allah and the way he put his trust in Him: 
Finally in 1972, with a few exceptions, the continent had become independent. 
In this region riddled with corruption, the independence of 1960 hardly brought any relief from the political pressure of the imperial western states. 
Maintaining that all forms of improvement in the world are attainable through conflict, they believed they could achieve their goals only through a communist revolution. 
In his time, those resisting him and the communist system were executed. The civil war lasted for three years, and it brought complete devastation to Russia. 
His "communism project" became an utter griefridden experience for the public; millions drifted into starvation and misery, villagers were used for forced labour and people were severely oppressed. Meanwhile, all forms of religious practises were outlawed. 
Forced emigration became part of the Stalinist policy; millions of people were relocated, leaving their homelands for remote parts of Russia. 
From what historians relate, Stalin derived pleasure from such brutality and, in his Kremlin office, very much enjoyed examining the reports of the death tolls coming in from the labour camps. 
Economic deterioration in Russia had its parallels in China, thanks to the principles adhered to under the name of "socialist change and equal rights." 
Religion, considered to be the greatest obstacle to the materialist system, became a subject discussion of which was banned. 
Communist ideology sees the concept of family as against its own purposes. 
The end of a country in which communism is adopted will not be different from Russia or China. 
Moral values are entirely refused and groups with vested interests dominate society. 
People are indoctrinated into believing that the dictator is infallible and that his decisions are relevant. 
Rebellions were put down bloodily by communist militants. Insurgents were shot dead before the eyes of the public. 
The Communist Party committed the country to endless cycles of civil strife, rioting and disorder. 
The youth were brainwashed with disbelief and the system raised militants instead of peaceful generations. 
Allah, the Creator of man, also created the way by following which we will feel ourselves secure and peaceful and He communicates this system to us through the Qur'an. 
Therefore, it is impossible for the theory of evolution, which holds that living beings are not created by Allah, but are products of coincidences, to be true. 
Unsurprisingly, when we look at the theory of evolution, we see that this theory is denounced by scientific findings. The design in life is extremely complex and striking. 
We have dealt with this subject in great detail in some of our other studies, and shall continue to do so. However, we think that, considering its importance, it will be helpful to make a short summary here as well. 
In this section, we will examine these three basic points in general outlines: 
Since the theory of evolution denies creation and does not accept any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the "first cell" originated coincidentally within the laws of nature, without any design, plan, or arrangement. 
Even in the period when Darwin wrote The Origin of Species, the belief that bacteria could come into existence from nonliving matter was widely accepted in the world of science. 
With various theses he advanced in the 1930's, he tried to prove that the cell of a living being could originate by coincidence. 
The theory maintains that millions of living beings present on the earth formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms such as the ears, eyes, lungs, and wings, underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. 
The reason for this is very simple: the DNA has a very complex structure and random effects can only cause harm to it. 
An earthquake does not improve the city, it brings destruction.33 
Since these would be in a transitional phase, they should be disabled, defective, crippled living beings. 
All the fossils unearthed in excavations showed that, contrary to the expectations of evolutionists, life appeared on earth all of a sudden and fullyformed. 
A famous British paleontologist, Derek V. Ager, admits this fact, even though he is an evolutionist: 
Also, it is very strong evidence that living beings are created. 
By outlining the link chain as "Australopithecus > Homo habilis > Homo erectus > Homo sapiens," evolutionists imply that each of these species is one another's ancestor. 
Put briefly, the scenario of human evolution, which is sought to be upheld with the help of various drawings of some "half ape, half human" creatures appearing in the media and course books, that is, frankly, by means of propaganda, is nothing but a tale with no scientific ground. 
Lord Solly Zuckerman, one of the most famous and respected scientists in the U. K., who carried out research on this subject for years, and particularly studied Australopithecus fossils for 15 years, finally concluded, despite being an evolutionist himself, that there is, in fact, no such family tree branching out from apelike creatures to man. 
The men and women of the believers are friends of one another. They command what is right and forbid what is wrong and establish salat and pay zakat, and obey Allah and His Messenger. 
However, there are people on the streets trying to survive. If we ignore the existence of these people, we will not be listening to our consciences. 
In this structure, the rights of the poor and of those forced from their homes are protected. All means are used to prepare better conditions for them and to lessen their pain. For this cause, people do not avoid making sacrifices. 
All the pain these people suffer is because of this child. 
They were taken and locked in strategic buildings, all possible bombing targets. 
In heavy rain and facing severe cold, women, small children and the elderly left everything behind and walked, destination unknown. Approximately three months later, when they returned, nothing was the same. 
Refugees and the public were subjected to all forms of violence and torture. Serbs raped women, killed the pregnant and destroyed buildings and property. More than 100,000 people were killed. The state of the forced migrants was dreadful. 
Duvalier established a dictatorial regime like any other country in the vicinity. 
As in all other dictatorships, the Duvaliers revelled in extravagance while the public lived in great misery. 
 A camp near Forres. 
Worthy gentleman! 
So should he look That seems to speak things strange. 
God save the King! 
"Give me," quoth I. 
 Here I have a pilot's thumb, Wreck'd as homeward he did come. 
The charm's wound up. 
Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear Things that do sound so fair? 
The King hath happily received, Macbeth, The news of thy success; and when he reads Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight, His wonders and his praises do contend Which should be thine or his. 
ANGUS. We are sent To give thee, from our royal master, thanks; Only to herald thee into his sight, Not pay thee. 
ANGUS. Who was the Thane lives yet, But under heavy judgement bears that life Which he deserves to lose. 
This supernatural soliciting Cannot be ill, cannot be good. If ill, Why hath it given me earnest of success, Commencing in a truth? 
If chance will have me King, why, chance may crown me Without my stir. 
New honors come upon him, Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould But with the aid of use. 
 Very gladly. MACBETH. 
That is a step On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap, For in my way it lies. 
SCENE V. Inverness. Macbeth's castle. 
Thou'ldst have, great Glamis, That which cries, "Thus thou must do, if thou have it; And that which rather thou dost fear to do Than wishest should be undone." 
Come to my woman's breasts, And take my milk for gall, your murthering ministers, Wherever in your sightless substances You wait on nature's mischief! 
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble, Which still we thank as love. 
 Your servants ever Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt, To make their audit at your Highness' pleasure, Still to return your own. DUNCAN. 
By your leave, hostess. 
If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well It were done quickly. 
If the assassination Could trammel up the consequence, and catch, With his surcease, success; that but this blow Might be the beall and the endallhere, But here, upon this bank and shoal of time, We'ld jump the life to come. 
When in swinish sleep Their drenched natures lie as in a death, What cannot you and I perform upon The unguarded Duncan? 
Thanks, sir, the like to you. 
Get thee to bed. 
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible To feeling as to sight? 
Thou sure and firmset earth, Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear Thy very stones prate of my whereabout, And take the present horror from the time, Which now suits with it. 
Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven, or to hell. 
 That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold; What hath quench'd them hath given me fire. 
It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman, Which gives the stern'st good night. 
But wherefore could not I pronounce "Amen"? 
What do you mean? 
 Who was it that thus cried? 
Go, get some water And wash this filthy witness from your hand. 
I'll go no more. I am afraid to think what I have done; Look on't again I dare not. 
What hands are here? 
I hear knocking At the south entry. 
Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts. 
To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself. 
Who's there, in th' other devil's name? 
Is thy master stirring? 
Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes. 
Is the King stirring, worthy Thane? 
What's the matter? 
 [Aside to Malcolm.] What should be spoken here, where our fate, Hid in an auger hole, may rush and seize us? 
Let's away, Our tears are not yet brew'd. 
Look to the lady. 
Fears and scruples shake us. 
I'll to England. 
This murtherous shaft that's shot Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way Is to avoid the aim. 
Ah, good father, Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man's act, Threaten his bloody stage. 
How goes the world, sir, now? 
What good could they pretend? 
 Fail not our feast. BANQUO. 
Attend those men Our pleasure? 
It was, so please your Highness. 
Well then, now Have you consider'd of my speeches? 
So is he mine, and in such bloody distance That every minute of his being thrusts Against my near'st of life; and though I could With barefaced power sweep him from my sight And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not, For certain friends that are both his and mine, Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall Who I myself struck down. 
Duncan is in his grave; After life's fitful fever he sleeps well. Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison, Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing, Can touch him further. 
There's comfort yet; they are assailable. 
Then be thou jocund. 
 What's to be done? MACBETH. 
Come, seeling night, Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day, And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale! 
A banquet prepared. 
Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure The table round. 
Sweet remembrancer! 
Now good digestion wait on appetite, And health on both! LENNOX. 
If thou canst nod, speak too. 
The time has been, That, when the brains were out, the man would die, And there an end; but now they rise again, With twenty mortal murthers on their crowns, And push us from our stools. 
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends. I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing To those that know me. 
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold; Thou hast no speculation in those eyes Which thou dost glare with.

So that, I say, He has borne all things well; and I do think That, had he Duncan's sons under his keyAs, an't please heaven, he shall notthey should find What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance. 
He knows thy thought: Hear his speech, but say thou nought.

Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill Shall come against him. 
A seventh! 
I did hear The galloping of horse. Who wast came by? 
'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word Macduff is fled to England. 
I dare not speak much further; But cruel are the times when we are traitors And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor From what we fear, yet know not what we fear, But float upon a wild and violent sea Each way and move. 
 Yes, he is dead. 
Let us rather Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men Bestride our downfall'n birthdom. 
Each new morn New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out Like syllable of dolor. 
What I believe, I'll wall; What know, believe; and what I can redress, As I shall find the time to friend, I will. 
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues, Was once thought honest. You have loved him well; He hath not touch'd you yet. 
I am young, but something You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb To appease an angry god. 
A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge. 
Wear thou thy wrongs; The title is affeer'd. 
What I am truly Is thine and my poor country's to command. 
Enter a Doctor. 
I thank you, Doctor. 
My countryman, but yet I know him not. 
Well too. MACDUFF. The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace? 
Merciful heaven! 
When was it she last walked? 
Observe her; stand close. 
I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour. 
Hell is murky. 
Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him? 
What does the tyrant? 
ANGUS. Now does he feel His secret murthers sticking on his hands, Now minutely revolts upbraid his faithbreach; Those he commands move only in command, Nothing in love. 
 Who then shall blame His pester'd senses to recoil and start, When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there? 
Enter Macbeth, Doctor, and Attendants. 
Was he not born of woman? 
What wood is this before us? 
The time approaches That will with due decision make us know What we shall say we have and what we owe. 
Were they not forced with those that should be ours, We might have met them dareful, beard to beard, And beat them backward home. 
She should have died hereafter; There would have been a time for such a word. 
 Gracious my lord, I should report that which I say I saw, But know not how to do it. MACBETH. 
I pull in resolution and begin To doubt the equivocation of the fiend That lies like truth. 
Enter Malcolm, old Siward, Macduff, and their Army, with boughs. Drum and colors. MALCOLM. 
Enter Malcolm and old Siward. 
We have met with foes That strike beside us. 
Enter, sir, the castle. 
Turn, hell hound, turn! 
I will not yield, To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet, And to be baited with the rabble's curse. 
Macduff is missing, and your noble son. 
They will be well rewarded in this world and in the Hereafter. 
What we have said so far makes it clear that only those who are sincere in their faith will understand the Qur'an correctly. 
Since he cannot reason, he will be unable to any more than make twisted and mindless assumptions in interpreting Qur'anic verses. 
No matter how clever and cultured a person may be, if he views the Qur'an with an insincere and concealed intent, he will not be able understand or interpret it correctly, and will reach many false conclusions. 
In fact, just the opposite applies; the Qur'an will simply increase such a person's perversion and confusion. 
The Qur'anic commandments have been explained in a clear and simple manner so believers can easily abide by them. 
Those firmly rooted in knowledge say, 'We have faith in it. 
Time and again a word can have more than one meaning. 
As a result, they will declare that those verses they are unable to understand are contradictory. 
Their minds are so closed that in one verse they are described as less than cattle. 
Thinking, using one's reason, and making an effort to try and grasp the meanings, finer points, mysteries and miracles of the Qur'an are essential if one is to truly appreciate it. 
Accordingly, one should try to establish a connection between the verses and himself, his surroundings and the events he experiences, and strive to understand the Qur'an by thinking deeply on all of these. 
He will fight with all his might to seek ways to contradict the Qur'an. In so doing he will argue about the verses. 
So the accomplishments of an arrogant person, such as his academic career, culture and expertise, will actually serve to distance him from the Qur'an. 
The unwise claims made by seeming experts or intellectuals regarding the Qur'an are proof of the fact that pride prevents anyone from truly acknowledging the Qur'an. 
Who hears the Signs of God recited to him and then persists in his arrogance just as if he had never heard them. 
People who do that follow an inherited traditional religion rather than the Qur'an, and at the same time try to adapt the Qur'an to that perverted religion. 
Right guidance has become clearly distinct from error. 
Anyone who rejects false gods and has faith in God has grasped the Firmest Handhold, which will never give way. 
Then when they arrive He (God) will say, 'Did you deny My Signs even though you did not have proper knowledge of them. 
And when he (Solomon) saw it standing firmly in his presence, he said, 'This is part of my Lord's favour to test me to see if I will give thanks or show ingratitude. 
And when the caravan went on its way, their father said, 'I can smell Joseph's scent! 
They usually make unreasonable and ignorant remarks about the Qur'an using sentences that begin with such words as, "In the 21st century…", "In our day and age…", "In the space age….", "In the West…." , and so on. 
The verse that they use to make their claim reads: 
Now, let us examine why such a thoughtless claim is illogical and baseless from several angles: 
As can be seen, the drinks served in Heaven do not have any of the negative effects and attributes those alcoholic drinks in this world do. 
But the sin in them is greater than the benefit.' 
The logic of anyone who sees this topic as a contradiction when God has made it all so clear must be seriously doubted. 
Where they will recline, calling for plentiful fruit and drink (sharab) ... 
First of all, if you take a good look, you can see that there is no such praise in the verse. The praise is rather of "the fruit of the datepalm and the grapevine" which provide people with wholesome nourishment. 
The intoxicants mentioned in the first part of the verse are what people distill from these components and cause drunkenness, which have already been mentioned in many parts of the Qur'an as harmful and wrong. 
He can make this clear in a single verse with the same superior Wisdom. 
The deniers' attempt to find contradiction in such obvious subjects clearly shows their desperate situation in the face of the Qur'an. 
Naturally, these antibodies and growth hormones make their way to the pig's muscles during circulation and accumulate there. 
Today in countries such as the U. S.A. and Germany, where pork is popular, obesity has become a widespread problem. 
God has also prohibited, in the Qur'an, the consumption of any animal that has been consecrated to something other than God. He has only forbidden you carrion, blood and pork and what has been consecrated to other than God. 
You who have faith! God will test you with game animals which come within the reach of your hands and spears, so that God will know those who fear Him in the Unseen. 
The Qur'an conveys the ignorant words of those who are unable to realize this holy wisdom: 
To display the laws of God that have existed since the creation of the universe and govern believers as well as nonbelievers. 
They keep others from it and avoid it themselves. 
It is quite natural for such similarities to exist because, ultimately (if we were to remove the altered parts of the Torah and the Gospel) they all contain the words of God and their message is one and the same. 
And We have sent down the Book to you (O Muhammad) with truth, confirming and conserving the previous Books. 
This reality is stated in the Qur'an: 
Therefore, the presence of these similarities does not in any way show that our Prophet wrote the Qur'an. In fact, quite the opposite; it further emphasizes the truth that the books of all Divine religions come from one source, God. 
God has revealed in His verses that the Qur'an is the book of truth sent by Him and the condition of those who do not believe in this truth. 
The term "Ummi", which refers to a person who has no knowledge of the previous divine books and is not a member of these religions, is used in the Qur'an for the Prophet Muhammad to emphasize his attribute. 
The verse is: 
So it becomes clear that the term is not used in the Qur'an with its classical form to imply the "illiterate". 
Since the previous divine books have gone through extensive manmade changes and have lost much of their original divine message, they contain conflicting references and logic, and are at times the direct opposite of what is contained in the Qur'an. There are also many variations in their anecdotes compared to Qur'anic ones. 
These books have been changed in content and logic as well as style and composition; hence they have been turned into mystical religious history texts rather than divine books. 
Overall, the main subject in the Qur'an is declaring God to be free of imperfection and ordering believers to avoid idolatry in order to surrender themselves only to God. 
The Jews say, 'God's hand is chained.' 
Another such claim the Qur'an entirely opposes is the crucifixion of the Prophet Jesus by the Jews. 
The invalidity of this assumption is visible from several standpoints. 
The number of written sources that have survived to our time is very limited, and furthermore not all of them have been translated. 
Incorrect information, superstitions and twisted beliefs were common in those ancient societies. 
They have brought injustice and falsehood.' 
We chose him in the world and in the hereafter he will be one of the true believers. 
In fact, one does not necessarily have to be aware of this special use of the term in Arabic to grasp its purpose. 
God gives this miraculous creature as an example in the Qur'an to emphasize the supremacy of His Creation. 
Guide us on the Straight Path, the Path of those You have blessed, not of those with anger on them, nor of the misguided. 
It is stated in various parts of the Qur'an that the universe was created in six days. 
These verses are as follows: 
Yet, if a person concentrates and uses wisdom he can readily see that there is absolutely no paradox at all. 
In the 11th and 12th verses state that the sky was formed in 2 days. 
However, with the spread of Christianity and its cultural influences during the second and third centuries AD the ancient Egyptians forgot their religion as well as the language, and the use of hieroglyphs came to a gradual stop. 
This discovery made it possible to research ancient Egyptian civilization, their beliefs and social life. 
The Qur'an, on the other hand, makes no reference to the flood being universal. 
We can see the Qur'an states that only the people of the Prophet Noah were destroyed, and not the whole world. 
We would never destroy any cities unless their inhabitants were wrongdoers. 
The Prophet Noah was only sent to his people to remind them. 
Buck lived at a big house in the sunkissed Santa Clara Valley. 
Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king,king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller's place, humans included. 
Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. 
During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. 
But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered housedog. 
The Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers' Association, and the boys were busy organizing an athletic club, on the memorable night of Manuel's treachery. 
This man talked with Manuel, and money chinked between them. 
Never in all his life had he been so vilely treated, and never in all his life had he been so angry. 
The hoarse shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was. 
The man sprang for his throat, but Buck was too quick for him. 
Why were they keeping him pent up in this narrow crate? 
But each time it was the bulging face of the saloonkeeper that peered in at him by the sickly light of a tallow candle. 
Wherever the hatchet fell on the outside, he was there on the inside, snarling and growling, as furiously anxious to get out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out. 
Here was neither peace, nor rest, nor a moment's safety. 
It was a harness, such as he had seen the grooms put on the horses at home. 
By afternoon, Perrault, who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his despatches, returned with two more dogs. 
Like Dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing, expected nothing; and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst, even Spitz left him alone. 
Forever after Buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of their comradeship had no more trouble. 
He would return and see how his own teammates were making out. 
The resulting tangle was even worse, but Buck took good care to keep the traces clear thereafter; and ere the day was done, so well had he mastered his work, his mates about ceased nagging him. 
Francois's whip snapped less frequently, and Perrault even honored Buck by lifting up his feet and carefully examining them. 
Always, they broke camp in the dark, and the first gray of dawn found them hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them. 
A dainty eater, he found that his mates, finishing first, robbed him of his unfinished ration. 
He was fit, that was all, and unconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life. 
All his days, no matter what the odds, he had never run from a fight. 
He did not rob openly, but stole secretly and cunningly, out of respect for club and fang. 
In short, the things he did were done because it was easier to do them than not to do them. 
He could eat anything, no matter how loathsome or indigestible; and, once eaten, the juices of his stomach extracted the last least particle of nutriment; and his blood carried it to the farthest reaches of his body, building it into the toughest and stoutest of tissues. 
Yet it was a secret growth. 
He was too busy adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease, and not only did he not pick fights, but he avoided them whenever possible. 
On the other hand, possibly because he divined in Buck a dangerous rival, Spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth. 
Francois was surprised, too, when they shot out in a tangle from the disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble. 
The courier shook his head dubiously. 
Two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses into shape, and the woundstiffened team was under way, struggling painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered, and for that matter, the hardest between them and Dawson. 
Nothing daunted him. 
He skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt. 
Once, the sled broke through, with Dave and Buck, and they were halffrozen and all but drowned by the time they were dragged out. 
Then came the search for a place to descend, which descent was ultimately made by the aid of the rope, and night found them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the day's credit. 
Later his feet grew hard to the trail, and the wornout footgear was thrown away. 
Straight away he raced, with Dolly, panting and frothing, one leap behind; nor could she gain on him, so great was his terror, nor could he leave her, so great was her madness. 
"All de tam I watch dat Buck I know for sure. 
This was the pride of Dave as wheeldog, of Solleks as he pulled with all his strength; the pride that laid hold of them at break of camp, transforming them from sour and sullen brutes into straining, eager, ambitious creatures; the pride that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night, letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent. 
Francois called him and sought him in vain. 
Here were many men, and countless dogs, and Buck found them all at work. 
They hauled cabin logs and firewood, freighted up to the mines, and did all manner of work that horses did in the Santa Clara Valley. 
When he moaned and sobbed, it was with the pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers, and the fear and mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery. 
The old awe departed, and they grew equal to challenging his authority. 
He backed up Spitz with his whip, while Buck backed up the remainder of the team. 
And leap by leap, like some pale frost wraith, the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead. 
He was ranging at the head of the pack, running the wild thing down, the living meat, to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm blood. 
From Spitzbergen through the Arctic, and across Canada and the Barrens, he had held his own with all manner of dogs and achieved to mastery over them. 
Bitter rage was his, but never blind rage. 
But instead, Buck's shoulder was slashed down each time as Spitz leaped lightly away. 
And all the while the silent and wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down. 
There was a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on three legs. 
Thrice he tried to knock him over, then repeated the trick and broke the right fore leg. 
He took Buck by the scruff of the neck, and though the dog growled threateningly, dragged him to one side and replaced Solleks. 
It was his by right. 
Buck laughed, as dogs laugh, yet kept his distance. 
There was no place for Buck save at the front. 
Once more Francois called, and once more Buck laughed and kept away. 
His traces were fastened, the sled broken out, and with both men running they dashed out on to the river trail. 
So long as that were not interfered with, they did not care what happened. 
The first night in camp, Joe, the sour one, was punished roundlya thing that Spitz had never succeeded in doing. 
"Nevaire such a dog as dat Buck!" he cried. 
The men rode and ran by turn, and the dogs were kept on the jump, with but infrequent stoppages. 
He was all but naked, a ragged and firescorched skin hanging part way down his back, but on his body there was much hair. 
About his body there was a peculiar springiness, or resiliency, almost catlike, and a quick alertness as of one who lived in perpetual fear of things seen and unseen. 
And dreaming there by the Yukon bank, with lazy eyes blinking at the fire, these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to rise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his neck, till he whimpered low and suppressedly, or growled softly, and the halfbreed cook shouted at him, "Hey, you Buck, wake up!" 
The dogs were tired, the drivers grumbling, and to make matters worse, it snowed every day. 
By the time Cassiar Bar was reached, he was so weak that he was falling repeatedly in the traces. The Scotch halfbreed called a halt and took him out of the team, making the next dog, Solleks, fast to the sled. 
Dave had bitten through both of Solleks's traces, and was standing directly in front of the sled in his proper place. 
The driver was perplexed. 
Here the train was halted. The Scotch halfbreed slowly retraced his steps to the camp they had left. 
Chapter V The Toil of Trace and Trail Thirty days from the time it left Dawson, the Salt Water Mail, with Buck and his mates at the fore, arrived at Skaguay. 
Buck's one hundred and forty pounds had dwindled to one hundred and fifteen. 
The rest of his mates, though lighter dogs, had relatively lost more weight than he. 
Buck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the Government agent, and knew that the Scotch halfbreed and the mailtrain drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of Perrault and Francois and the others who had gone before. 
When driven with his mates to the new owners' camp, Buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair, tent half stretched, dishes unwashed, everything in disorder; also, he saw a woman. 
The tin dishes were packed away unwashed. 
They're lazy, I tell you, and you've got to whip them to get anything out of them. 
That's their way. 
"Rest be blanked," said Hal, with his beardless lips; and Mercedes said, "Oh!" in pain and sorrow at the oath. 
"Half as many is too much; get rid of them. 
Throw away that tent, and all those dishes,who's going to wash them, anyway? 
Good Lord, do you think you're travelling on a Pullman?" 
She cried in general, and she cried in particular over each discarded thing. 
This accomplished, the outfit, though cut in half, was still a formidable bulk. 
His heart was not in the work, nor was the heart of any dog. 
But they hastened it by overfeeding, bringing the day nearer when underfeeding would commence. 
And to cap it all, when Mercedes, with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver in her throat, could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more, she stole from the fishsacks and fed them slyly. 
And though they were making poor time, the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely. 
Not only did they not know how to work dogs, but they did not know how to work themselves. 
Their irritability arose out of their misery, increased with it, doubled upon it, outdistanced it. 
Charles and Hal wrangled whenever Mercedes gave them a chance. 
The pain of the beating was dull and distant, just as the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and distant. 
Mercedes dried her eyes and looked at John Thornton. 
"The bottom's likely to drop out at any moment. 
Hal drew his long huntingknife. 
A few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river. 
They were limping and staggering. 
He was still limping slightly at the time he rescued Buck, but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left him. 
And he saw further. 
He had a way of taking Buck's head roughly between his hands, and resting his own head upon Buck's, of shaking him back and forth, the while calling him ill names that to Buck were love names. 
Buck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt. 
And as Buck understood the oaths to be love words, so the man understood this feigned bite for a caress. 
But in spite of this great love he bore John Thornton, which seemed to bespeak the soft civilizing influence, the strain of the primitive, which the Northland had aroused in him, remained alive and active. 
He was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn. 
"Jump, Buck!" he commanded, sweeping his arm out and over the chasm. 
Thornton shook his head. 
Buck loosed his teeth from the flesh of the arm and drove in again for the throat. 
But his reputation was made, and from that day his name spread through every camp in Alaska. 
At a particularly bad spot, where a ledge of barely submerged rocks jutted out into the river, Hans cast off the rope, and, while Thornton poled the boat out into the stream, ran down the bank with the end in his hand to snub the boat when it had cleared the ledge. 
From below came the fatal roaring where the wild current went wilder and was rent in shreds and spray by the rocks which thrust through like the teeth of an enormous comb. 
Again the rope was attached and he was launched, and again he struck out, but this time straight into the stream. 
Buck held on till he was on a line straight above Thornton; then he turned, and with the speed of an express train headed down upon him. 
Hans snubbed the rope around the tree, and Buck and Thornton were jerked under the water. 
"Well," Matthewson said, slowly and deliberately, so that all could hear, "I've got a thousand dollars that says he can't. 
The face of Jim O'Brien, a Mastodon King and oldtime comrade, caught his eyes. 
Matthewson waxed jubilant. 
The great breast and heavy fore legs were no more than in proportion with the rest of the body, where the muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin. 
As Thornton got to his feet, Buck seized his mittened hand between his jaws, pressing in with his teeth and releasing slowly, halfreluctantly. 
It was the answer, in terms, not of speech, but of love. 
The oldest tradition stopped before it got back to him. 
So, on this great journey into the East, straight meat was the bill of fare, ammunition and tools principally made up the load on the sled, and the timecard was drawn upon the limitless future. 
For weeks at a time they would hold on steadily, day after day; and for weeks upon end they would camp, here and there, the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the fire. 
Sometimes they went hungry, sometimes they feasted riotously, all according to the abundance of game and the fortune of hunting. 
He knew it for a Hudson Bay Company gun of the young days in the Northwest, when such a gun was worth its height in beaver skins packed flat, And that was allno hint as to the man who in an early day had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets. 
The vision of the shortlegged hairy man came to him more frequently, now that there was little work to be done; and often, blinking by the fire, Buck wandered with him in that other world which he remembered. 
For a day at a time he would lie in the underbrush where he could watch the partridges drumming and strutting up and down. 
As he drew closer to the cry he went more slowly, with caution in every movement, till he came to an open place among the trees, and looking out saw, erect on haunches, with nose pointed to the sky, a long, lean, timber wolf. 
He ran him into a blind channel, in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way. 
He made it clear to Buck that he was to come, and they ran side by side through the sombre twilight, straight up the creek bed, into the gorge from which it issued, and across the bleak divide where it took its rise. 
He fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere into the sea, and by this stream he killed a large black bear, blinded by the mosquitoes while likewise fishing, and raging through the forest helpless and terrible. 
His muzzle was the long wolf muzzle, save that was larger than the muzzle of any wolf; and his head, somewhat broader, was the wolf head on a massive scale. 
When Thornton passed a caressing hand along his back, a snapping and crackling followed the hand, each hair discharging its pent magnetism at the contact. 
His muscles were surcharged with vitality, and snapped into play sharply, like steel springs. 
He would bark and dance about in front of the bull, just out of reach of the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have stamped his life out with a single blow. 
The downcoming winter was harrying them on to the lower levels, and it seemed they could never shake off this tireless creature that held them back. 
The great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns, and the shambling trot grew weak and weaker. 
He could feel a new stir in the land. 
He broke into the long easy lope, and went on, hour after hour, never at loss for the tangled way, heading straight home through strange country with a certitude of direction that put man and his magnetic needle to shame. 
The birds talked of it, the squirrels chattered about it, the very breeze whispered of it. 
He remarked the pregnant silence of the forest. 
The Yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the sprucebough lodge when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal the like of which they had never seen before. 
They scattered far and wide over the country, and it was not till a week later that the last of the survivors gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses. 
As the moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder. 
It was the call, the manynoted call, sounding more luringly and compellingly than ever before. And as never before, he was ready to obey. 
He worked along to a right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course of mining, and in this angle he came to bay, protected on three sides and with nothing to do but face the front. 
Straight away I was on the telephone and spoke to a farmer. 
I only learned the other day to my intense amazement, though on the most unimpeachable authority, that Stepan Trofimovitch had lived among us in our province not as an “exile” as we were accustomed to believe, and had never even been under police supervision at all. 
All his life he sincerely believed that in certain spheres he was a constant cause of apprehension, that every step he took was watched and noted, and that each one of the three governors who succeeded one another during twenty years in our province came with special and uneasy ideas concerning him, which had, by higher powers, been impressed upon each before everything else, on receiving the appointment. 
But the scene is suddenly changed. 
He read it to me twice, but did not send it, not knowing to whom to address it. 
Then he made friends with me again, which is a proof of the extreme kindness of his gentle and unresentful heart. 
But there was nothing Varvara Petrovna dreaded so much as a humorous tone. 
There are strange friendships. The two friends are always ready to fly at one another, and go on like that all their lives, and yet they cannot separate. 
What if Stepan Trofimovitch himself has, on more than one occasion, sobbed on my shoulder while he described to me in lurid colours all his most secret feelings. 
Perhaps in a week's time, a month's time, or even six months later, chancing to recall some phrase in such a letter, and then the whole letter with all its attendant circumstances, he would suddenly grow hot with shame, and be so upset that he fell ill with one of his attacks of “summer cholera.” 
I have two anecdotes to tell about that. 
When the baron positively asserted the absolute truth of the rumours of the great reform, which were then only just beginning to be heard, Stepan Trofimovitch could not contain himself, and suddenly shouted “Hurrah!” and even made some gesticulation indicative of delight. 
Then she turned to Stepan Trofimovitch, and with pale face and flashing eyes she hissed in a whisper: “I shall never forgive you for that!” 
Next day she met her friend as though nothing had happened, she never referred to the incident, but thirteen years afterwards, at a tragic moment, she recalled it and reproached him with it, and she turned pale, just as she had done thirteen years before. Only twice in the course of her life did she say to him: “I shall never forgive you for that!” 
It was in 1855, in springtime, in May, just after the news had reached Skvoreshniki of the death of LieutenantGeneral Gavrogin, a frivolous old gentleman who died of a stomach ailment on the way to the Crimea, where he was hastening to 'join the army on active service. 
Yet she was shocked by the suddenness of the news, and retired into complete solitude. 
Varvara Petrovna, whom he had left only four minutes earlier, was standing before him again. 
It was a peculiar time; something new was beginning, quite unlike the stagnation of the past, something very strange too, though it was felt everywhere, even at Skvoreshniki. 
And this was perplexing. 
She took to reading newspapers and magazines, prohibited publications printed abroad and even the revolutionary manifestoes which were just beginning to appear at the time (she was able to procure them all); but this only set her head in a whirl. 
She fell to writing letters; she got few answers, and they grew more incomprehensible as time went on. 
Varvara Petrovna's faith in everything instantly revived and she was thrown into a violent ferment. 
She had, however, another very important reason for the trip, which was to renew her connections in higher spheres. 
They were all strangely proud of something. On every face was written that they had only just discovered some extremely important secret. 
They abused one another, and took credit to themselves for it. 
These people were very serious and very polite; they behaved nicely; the others were evidently afraid of them; but it was obvious that they had no time to spare. 
Where is she? 
This worthy shopkeeper, with a grey beard and silverrimmed spectacles, still owed Stepan Trofimovitch four hundred roubles for some acres of timber he had bought on the latter's little estate (near Skvoreshniki). 
Crossing the frontier I felt myself in safety, a sensation, strange and new, for the first time after so many years”—and so on and so on. 
He was an uncomfortable sort of man, and had not been in the service. 
He found out the secret, however, and after some reflection took the money and went to Varvara Petrovna to thank her. She received him with warmth, but on this occasion, too, he shamefully disappointed her. 
She had lived a long while in Petersburg as a girl. Virginsky himself was a man of rare singleheartedness, and I have seldom met more honest fervour. 
Stepan Trofimovitch treated him very kindly, and indeed he behaved like a father to all of us. 
But you're a halfhatched chicken all the same. Shatov would give anything to hatch out,, but he's halfhatched too.” 
“My dear, hitherto I have only loved you, but now I respect you,” but I doubt whether this renunciation, worthy of ancient Home, was ever really uttered. On the contrary they say that he wept violently. 
But, of course, “Russian higher liberalism” could not look at the question in any other way. 
Varvara Petrovna overheard him on one occasion, and crying, “Nonsense, nonsense!” she went out of the room in a rage. 
Liputin, who happened to be present, observed malignantly to Stepan Trofimovitch: “It'll be a pity if their former serfs really do some mischief to messieurs les landowners to celebrate the occasion,” and he drew his forefinger round his throat. 
“Cher ami,” Stepan Trofimovitch observed, “believe me thatthis (he repeated the gesture) will never be of any use to our landowners nor to any of us in general. 
“Like hasty people we have been in too great a hurry with our peasants,” he said in conclusion of a series of remarkable utterances. 
A remarkable Russian poet who was also something of a wit, seeing the great Rachel on the stage for the first time cried in ecstasy, 'I wouldn't exchange Rachel for a peasant! 
I'm not talking of the days of Igor, of course. And besides it all comes of idleness. 
I'm ready to repeat it for thirty thousand years. 
And he who has no people has no God. 
This is a fact which will be realised. 
Although he often went too far, he was the first to suffer for it. 
She talked little to him and did not often interfere with him, but he was always morbidly conscious of her intent, searching eyes fixed upon him. 
One can't help believing that the tutor had rather a bad influence on his pupil's nerves. 
One must assume too that the friends went on weeping at night, throwing themselves in each other's arms, though their tears were not always due to domestic difficulties. 
It was added, too, that he had developed into a regular bully, insulting people for the mere pleasure of insulting them. 
From his munificence and hospitality he ought rather to have been a marshal of nobility of the good old days than a governor in such busy times as ours. 
Giving up her former romantic impulses (trips to Petersburg, plans for founding a magazine, and so on) she began to be careful and to save money. 
Her passion for her son dated from the time of his successes in Petersburg society, and grew more intense from the moment that he was degraded in the army. 
As ill luck would have it, the governor was not in the town at the time. He had gone to a little distance to stand godfather to the child of a very charming lady, recently left a widow in an interesting condition. 
But there is no need to anticipate events. 
The company was not very presentable, but very sprightly. 
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch took his hat and went up to the husband, who stood petrified in the middle of the general excitement. 
Nikolay listened with vexation and impatience. 
Within half an hour Nikolay was arrested and removed for the time to the guardroom, where he was confined in a special cell, with a special sentinel at the door. 
To the general amazement, when this lady arrived at the governor's in haste and in nervous irritation to discuss the matter with him at once, she was refused admittance, whereupon, without getting out of the carriage, she returned home, unable to believe her senses. 
And at last everything was explained! 
At two o'clock in the morning the prisoner, who had till then been calm and had even slept, suddenly became noisy, began furiously beating on the door with his fists,—with unnatural strength wrenched the iron grating off the door, broke the window, and cut his hands all over. 
A famous doctor was summoned from Moscow for a consultation; the whole town called on Varvara Petrovna. 
“Why,” laughed Liputin, “it was because I recognised that you were a clever man, and so I foresaw what your answer would be.” 
But, excuse me, did you consider me a sensible man and not insane when you sent Agafya?” 
“Well, there you're a little mistaken. I really was ... unwell ...” muttered Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, frowning. 
What object would there be in it?” 
“I couldn't challenge you to a duel, could I?” 
And that in the very place where he had saved up to buy himself a “little home,” where he had married for the second time, getting a dowry with his bride, where perhaps, for a hundred miles round there was not one man, himself included, who was the very least like a future member “of the universal human republic and social harmony.” 
The letter was brief, and the object of it was perfectly clear, though it contained only a plain statement of the abovementioned facts without drawing any inferences from them. 
On the death of the general, which had taken place the year before, the inconsolable widow had gone abroad with her daughter, partly in order to try the grapecure which she proposed to carry out at VerneyMontreux during the latter half of the summer. 
He was in a perfect rapture, especially as he had spent the whole time of his friend's absence in extreme dejection. 
She was cross with him at the time on account of a considerable gambling debt which she had suddenly discovered. 
With peculiar, gleefullyobsequious humour, he was beginning to describe the new governor's arrival. 
“What makes you think he's a handsome man? 
By the way, you're wearing a red necktie. Is it long since you've taken to it?” 
Go on about Von Lembke if you've really something to tell me, and do finish some time, I entreat you, I'm tired.” 
That is, he has gone away now ... that is, I mean to say, it was at once whispered in both his ears that I am a corrupter of youth, and a hotbed of provincial atheism.... 
She was an old maid without a farthing till she was fiveandforty. But now she's hooked her Von Lembke, and, of course, her whole object is to push him forward. 
She was fiveandtwenty then, and they used to rig her out in short skirts like a little girl. 
I don't know when I've met such a flabby woman, and what's more her legs are swollen, and she's a goodnatured simpleton, too. 
“Bah, and of course he's no relation of Lizaveta Nikolaevna's at all.... 
I fancy he is opposed to the intrigue himself, and isn't aiming at anything, and it was only the Von Lembke's tricks. He had a great respect for Nicolas. 
So it's only the Von Lembkev who is intriguing, and Praskovya is a blind woman. 
She suddenly tells me that all my suspicions are fancy. I told her to her face she was a fool. 
“Listen, Stepan Trofimovitch, of course I'm ignorant compared with you on all learned subjects, but as I was travelling here I thought a great deal about you. 
“That you and I are not the wisest people in the world, but that there are people wiser than we are.” 
“He seems to do nothing but get money. 
“And why is she always so cross?” he complained every minute, like a child. 
(N. B.—The Count's three daughters were all of marriageable age.) 
She sternly demanded the most precise and satisfactory explanations. 
An ordinary young man, very lively and free in his manners, but nothing special in him. 
But it all upset me so much at the time, my dear. 
As a relation he lives in their house. 
“No, nothing,” said Dasha, after a moment's thought, and she glanced at Varvara Petrovna with her lightcoloured eyes. 
Besides, he's still a handsome man... In short, Stepan Trofimovitch, for whom you have always had such a respect. 
“I don't mind, Varvara Petrovna, if I really must be married,” said Dasha firmly. 
You shall have twelve hundred roubles a year from me, with extras, fifteen hundred, besides board and lodging, which shall be at my expense, just as he has it now. 
Only you must set up your own servants. Your yearly allowance shall be paid to you all at once straight into your hands. 
Varvara Petrovna turned suddenly to her with a face flaming with anger. 
His lectures about the primitive peoples and primitive man were more interesting than the Arabian Nights. 
Varvara Petrovna approved, and thanked him for his excellent idea, and Dasha was delighted. 
Plunged in mournful reveries he had for some time been looking out of the window to see whether any of his friends were coining. But nobody would come. 
And on foot! 
What's that torn paper on the floor? 
“Excellente amie” his voice quivered suddenly. 
If anything happens let me know, even if it's at night. 
“Petrusha, c'est une si pauvre tete! He's good, noblehearted, very sensitive, and I was so delighted with him in Petersburg, comparing him with the young people of today. But c'est un pauvre sire, tout de meme.... And you know it all comes from that same halfbakedness, that sentimentality. 
I happened, too, to read some of Petrusha's letters to his father. He wrote extremely rarely, once a year, or even less often. 
Only recently, to inform him of his approaching visit, he had sent two letters, one almost immediately after the other. 
All his letters were short, dry, consisting only of instructions, and as the father and son had, since their meeting in Petersburg, adopted the fashionable “thou” and “thee,” Petrusha's letters had a striking resemblance to the missives that used to be sent by landowners of the old school from the town to their serfs whom they had left in charge of their estates. 
He cried, of course, talked well and talked a great deal, contradicted himself continually, made a casual pun, and was much pleased with it. 
It will soon be your birthday; I will come to see you with her. 
'Sit still, there's no need for you to go to her.' 
Simply because she's taken an absurd fancy into her heart. But I'm a serious man, and I can refuse to submit to the idle whims of a giddywoman! 
But she may exasperate me, and then it will matter. 
'Perhaps nothing will come of it'—what a thing to say! 
He, too, saw through me; that is, he clearly perceived that I saw through him, and that I was angry with him indeed, and he was angry with me too for being angry with him and seeing through him. 
From a certain point of view he had a very true understanding of some aspects of his position, and defined it, indeed, very subtly on those points about which he did not think it necessary to be secret. 
“How different she was in the old days when we used to talk together.... 
She despises the past.... 
But what I was most vexed with him for was that he could not bring himself to call on the Drozdovs, as he should have done on their arrival, to renew the acquaintance of which, so we heard they were themselves desirous, since they kept asking about him. 
Speaking generally, if I may venture to express my opinion on so delicate a subject, all these talented gentlemen of the middling sort who are sometimes in their lifetime accepted almost as geniuses, pass out of memory quite suddenly and without a trace when they die, and what's more, it often happens that even during their lifetime, as soon as a new generation grows up and takes the place of the one in which they have flourished, they are forgotten and neglected by every one in an incredibly short time. 
This somehow happens among us quite suddenly, like the shifting of the scenes on the stage. Oh, it's not at all the same as with Pushkin, Gogol, Moliere, Voltaire, all those great men who really had a new original word to say! 
It's true, too, that these talented gentlemen of the middling sort in the decline of their venerable years usually write themselves out in the most pitiful way, though they don't observe the fact themselves. 
People used to say about Karmazinov that his connections with aristocratic society and powerful personages were dearer to him than his own soul, people used to say that on meeting you he would be cordial, that he would fascinate and enchant you with his openheartedness, especially if you were of use to him in some way, and if you came to him with some preliminary recommendation. 
A year before, I had read an article of his in a review, written with an immense affectation of naive poetry, and psychology too. 
When I told Stepan Trofimovitch my opinion of Karmazinov's article he quite agreed with me. 
“To Bykovy Street? Oh, that's here, close by,” I cried in great excitement. 
“Straight on along this street and the second turning to the left.” 
I don't know why I turned back to follow him; I don't know why I ran for ten paces beside him. 
“And could you tell me where isthe nearest cabstand?” he shouted out to me again. 
I only know that I flew to pick it up. I am convinced that I did not really pick it up, but my first motion was unmistakable. 
I was told that you were quite knocked up with work.” 
His sharp eyes darted inquisitively from one corner of the room to another. 
He knows Shatov too, and he knows Shatov's wife. 
Do you really know anything about that unhappy marriage de ce pauvre ami and that woman,” cried Stepan Trofimovitch, carried away by sudden feeling. 
“You are the first man I've met who has known her personally; and if only ...” 
“No sort of delicate subject in it, and indeed it's shameful, and I didn't shout at you that it's nonsense, but at Liputin, because he adds things. 
And, indeed, he rejects morality itself altogether, and holds with the last new principle of general destruction for the sake of ultimate good. 
But you have no right, for I never speak to anyone. 
Liputin found this out and is laughing. 
'I understand that, if as you say you have lived so long abroad, cutting yourself off from people for objects of your own and forgetting Russia, you must inevitably look with wonder on us who are Russians to the backbone, and we must feel the same about you. 
Captain Lebyadkin thrashes that precious sister of his, the mad girl, every day with a whip, a real Cossack whip, every morning and evening. 
He's been here almost three weeks and under the most peculiar circumstances.” 
But what then, what then? 
I only tell this from his drunken chatter though, he doesn't speak of it himself when he's sober. 
“You're out of your mind!” muttered Stepan Trofimovitch, and suddenly, as though he were beside himself: “Liputin, you know perfectly well that you only came here to tell me something insulting of that sort and ... something worse!” 
I earnestly beg you! Sit down, and you, Liputin, begin directly, simply and without any excuses.” 
One of those actions concerned you personally. 
“I don't share that attitude. 
Stepan Trofimovitch sat pondering, and thought intently. 
And so you must be a spy.” 
On the contrary, he is scattering the money, though twelve days ago he begged fifteen kopecks of me, and it's he treats me to champagne, not I him. 
“Why warn me? 
I am the first to cry out that he is a man of the most subtle and refined intelligence, and I quite reassured Varvara Petrovna yesterday on that score. 
You talk of slander, but I'm not crying this aloud though the whole town is ringing with it; I only listen and assent. 
If he comes across a generoushearted man he'll force him to cover the sins of others under the shelter of his honourable name. 
And I think it's low.... And that's enough, enough!” 
“And you, Stepan Verhovensky, with your luminous mind, your kind heart, can harbour such a dirty, such a low idea ... and could before Liputin came!” 
He looked at me, made no answer and walked on in the same direction. 
Stepan Trofimovitch, it's you? You?” A fresh, joyous young voice rang out like music behind us. 
Why don't you say something?” 
“She's just the same as ever, cross, unjust, and always our precious aunt! 
I wanted to bring you a cake instead of a nosegay, but Mavriky Nikolaevitch declares that is not in the Russian spirit.” 
There were some among them who already detested her, and principally for her pride. 
“Why, what do you mean?” she cried in astonishment. 
I did once speak,” Stepan Trofimovitch faltered, crimsoning all over, “but ... I only hinted ... j'etais si nerveux et malade, et puis ...” 
What a person you are, really,” she interrupted impatiently. “I want to know what he's like; what sort of man he is.” 
I ran at once, of course, to Shatov. 
“Man ami!” said Stepan Trofimovitch, overtaking me on the steps. 
“Be sure to be at my lodging at ten or eleven o'clock when I come back. 
Oh, I've acted very wrongly in my conduct to you and to every one.” I did not find Shatov at home. 
I remembered that Liputin had told us hp had taken the wooden lodge in the yard that morning. In the lodge, which was too large for him, a deaf old woman who waited upon him was living too. 
“I love tea at night,” said he. “I walk much and drink it till daybreak. 
“Always; for a long while. 
I was surprised at his wanting to talk; I made up my mind to take advantage of the opportunity. “There were unpleasant misunderstandings this morning,” I observed. 
I trusted Liputin yesterday.” 
Only that's no matter.” 
He suddenly smiled with the childlike smile I had noticed that morning. 
“How do you mean they don't dare? 
“What is it restrains people from suicide, do you think?” I asked. 
Life is given now for pain and terror, and that's the deception. 
They will kill deception. 
You know that's a hymn. It's a hymn, if you're not an ass! 
Stay!” He caught hold of my coat, though I pulled myself away with all my might. 
I'd pick her up and chuck her out.... 
I've only just heard it, but it was from a most reliable source. 
“My friend, now I am utterly alone. 
They simply flew at me about those ears and noses, and some mysteries in Petersburg too. 
Where they got the idea I can't make out. 
They are all at loggerheads, except Lise, she keeps on with her 'Auntie, auntie!' but Lise's sly, and there's something behind it too. 
Only imagine, I come back and find a letter from her; read it, read it! 
“You can obtain a final answer from her: will that be enough for you? 
Stepan Trofimovitch listened to my assurances with an absent air, as though they did not concern him. I mentioned by the way my conversation with Kirillov, and added that he might be mad. 
People try to make up to them, but Stepan Verhovensky does not, anyway. 
What a stupid thing you've done!” I cried involuntarily. 
Liputin proposed this morning putting up barricades to keep out Nicolas; Liputin's a fool. 
I won't conceal the fact that I was terribly tempted to laugh. 
Thanking him for coming she led him up to her mother. “This is Mr. Shatov, of whom I have told you, and this is Mr. G——v, a great friend of mine and of Stepan Trofimovitch's. 
Mavriky Nikolaevitch made his acquaintance yesterday, too.” 
But the Swiss one had moustaches and a beard.” 
But you always will contradict your mother. 
She walked angrily out of the drawingroom. 
We, Mavriky Nikolaevitch and I that is, seeing that they were talking aloud and not trying to hide anything from us, began to listen, and at last they asked our advice. 
“She has not been to Switzerland for nothing.” 
The year passes, the newspapers are everywhere folded up and put away in cupboards, or are torn up and become litter, or are used for making parcels or wrapping things. 
She grew very warm over it, and although her explanation was obscure and incomplete, Shatov began to understand. 
“But a tendency would be no harm,” said Shatov, with a slight movement, “and one can hardly avoid it if there is any selection at all. 
And when we do publish the book I doubt whether we shall find out how to do it. Possibly after many trials; but the thought is alluring. 
Why shouldn't I— even I—work for the common cause? 
We would go halves. You would give the plan and the work. Mine would be the original idea and the means for publishing it. 
Liza hurriedly picked up from a chair a bundle of newspapers that lay tied up ready. 
Shatov sat for a full minute with the bundle in his outstretched hand, making no answer and staring at the floor. 
“You'd better find some one else for these jobs. I shouldn't suit you at all,” he brought out at last, dropping his voice in an awfully strange way, almost to a whisper. 
“Captain Lebyadkin your most humble friend And he has time no end.” 
As I have looked upon you as a colleague,” she turned to Shatov, “and as you live there, I wanted to question you so as to judge what more is to be expected of him.” 
Shatov looked at Liza again, scowled, and muttering, “What business is it of mine?” moved towards the door. 
We have so much still to talk over....” 
“What is there to talk over? 
Liza assured him in growing agitation. 
Shatov's face changed, as I recollect now. 
He stood for a few seconds longer, then went out of the room. 
The sound of her voice seemed to strike him; for some moments he looked at her intently, as though trying to penetrate to her very soul. 
Liza was completely overwhelmed, quite disproportionately in fact, so it seemed to me. 
She seemed to have forgotten that I was in the room, and was still standing in the same place by the table with her head bowed, plunged in thought, gazing fixedly at one spot on the carpet. 
“Ah, you, too, are going, goodbye,” she murmured in an ordinary friendly tone. “Give my greetings to Stepan Trofimovitch, and persuade him to come and see me as soon as he can. 
Mavriky Nikolaevitch, Anton Lavrentyevitch is going. 
I went out and had reached the bottom of the stairs when a footman suddenly overtook me at the street door. 
I give you my word of honour. 
I wasn't deceiving him, I really do want to edit books and found a printingpress....” 
“At three o'clock then. 
But all the same, I hurried to him. 
They were arguing, standing up, but now they all suddenly sat down, so that I had to sit down too. 
Though Shigalov knew me, he affected not to know me, probably not from hostile feelings, but for no particular reason. 
“I think he's mad on atheism.” 
“There's hatred in it, too,” he went on, after a minute's pause. 
There is nothing in it but an immense animal hatred for Russia which has eaten into their organism.... 
“But to cross the ocean in an emigrant steamer, though, to go .to an unknown country, even to make a personal experiment and all that—by Jove ... there really is a largehearted staunchness about it.... 
I went for him this morning when he began beating her again.” 
I'm afraid he'll come back drunk, and won't forget it—he'll give her a bad beating because of it.” We went downstairs at once. 
She looked at us rather cheerfully. Besides the candlestick, she had on the table in front of her a little peasant lookingglass, an old pack of cards, a tattered book of songs, and a white roll of German bread from which one or two bites had been taken. 
She scrutinised me intently from behind the candle, and turned again at once to Shatov (and she took no more notice of me for the rest of the conversation, as though I had not been near her). 
“Are you tired of walking up and down alone in your garret?” she laughed, displaying two rows of magnificent teeth. 
“Do you know what, Shatushka?” She shook her head. 
And I don't care whether he's here or not. 
I call to him: 'Lebyadkin, bring the water! 'or' Lebyadkin, bring my shoes!' and he runs. 
The only difference is that he doesn't fetch the water but beats her for it; but she isn't a bit afraid of him. 
'What treasure is that?' asked the Mother Superior. 
Since then when I bow down to the ground at my prayers, I've taken to kissing the earth. 
The tears flow of themselves, that's the truth. 
And big tears glittered in her eyes. “Shatushka, Shatushka, is it true that your wife ran away from you?” 
“You're afraid of him. 
Perhaps it was you. 
“Shatov, Shatov, friend....! open!” yelled the captain. 
“Don't answer!” Shatov whispered to me again. 
Shatov, I'm good; I'll forgive you.... 
“And you sold your sister.” 
“Scououndrel!” came from the other side of the door at last, and the captain hurriedly beat a retreat downstairs, puffing like a samovar, stumbling on every step. 
He listened a long while, and even stealthily descended a few steps. 
“There's nothing to be heard; he isn't beating her; he must have flopped down at once to go to sleep. 
“Listen, Shatov, what am I to gather from all this?” 
An improbable idea was growing stronger and stronger in my mind. 
After her a little later and much more quickly Lizaveta Nikolaevna came in, and with her, hand in hand, Marya Timofyevna Lebyadkin! If I had seen this in my dreams, even then I should not have believed it. 
She had taken her usual place in church in the first row on the left, and a footman in livery had put down a velvet cushion for her to kneel on; everything in fact, had been as usual. 
I had noticed just such a one with a wreath of paper roses in a corner under the ikons when I was at Mary Timofyevna's the day before. To put a finishingtouch to it, though the lady walked with modestly downcast eyes there was a sly and merry smile on her face. 
Varvara Petrovna, who was not easily disconcerted, especially in public, looked at her sternly and with dignity. 
In the last famine year she had sent five hundred roubles to the chief committee for the relief of the sufferers, and people talked of it in the town. 
“I say, she gave her ten roubles!” some one said in the crowd. “Let me kiss your hand,” faltered the unknown, holding tight in the fingers of her left hand the corner of the tenrouble note, which fluttered in the draught. 
It was our respectable and respected merchant Andreev, a man in spectacles with a grey beard, wearing Russian dress and holding a high round hat in his hands. 
“My brother's name is Lebyadkin.” 
She motioned Marya Timofyevna to a seat in the middle of the room, by a large round table. 
“Oh, well ...” he stammered with an incongruous smile. 
“Whaat?” Varvara Petrovna started, and drew herself up in her chair. 
“I'm not your aunt. 
Marya Timofyevna, not expecting such an angry outburst, began trembling all over in little convulsive shudders, as though she were in a fit, and sank back in her chair. 
And this was an exceptional occasion too. 
The reason of this rupture was still a mystery to Varvara Petrovna, which made it all the more offensive; but the chief cause of offence was that Praskovya Ivanovna had succeeded in taking up an extraordinarily supercilious attitude towards Varvara Petrovna. 
It is true that she was not well, and always became more irritable in illness. 
What are you fancying now; what is it vexes you?” 
And he also happened to be a wizard. 
Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry's best friends at Hogwarts, came from a whole family of wizards. 
"I'MAFRIENDOFHARRY'SFROMSCHOOL" Uncle Vernon's small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was rooted to the spot. 
Harry's stomach gave a funny jolt. 
He had been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a whole hour. 
He had never received a birthday card in his life. 
Harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across his face as he saw all nine of the Weasleys waving furiously at him, standing in front of a large pyramid. 
I asked Dad, and he reckons I shouldn't have shouted. 
Most of it's gone on this trip, but they're going to buy me a new wand for next year. 
Any chance of meeting you there? 
Percy, who was in his seventh and final year at Hogwarts, was looking particularly smug. 
He had pinned his Head Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair, his hornrimmed glasses flashing in the Egyptian sun. 
There was another note from Ron beneath it. 
If not, I'll see you on the Hogwarts Express on September first! 
There was a large jar of Fleetwood's HighFinish Handle Polish, a pair of gleaming silver TallTwig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys, and a Handbook of DoItYourself Broomcare. 
Won't say no more here. 
The Hogwarts Express will leave ftom King's Cross station, platform nine and threequarters, at eleven o'clock. 
Please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to sign. 
But how on earth was he going to persuade Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia to sign the form? 
Deciding that he'd worry about the Hogsmeade form when he woke up, Harry got back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the chart he'd made for himself, counting down the days left until his return to Hogwarts. 
Look at his hair!" 
Compared to the man on the television, however, whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted, elbowlength tangle, Harry felt very well groomed indeed. 
"Shshe's not coming here, is she?" 
At Dudley's fifth birthday party, Aunt Margo had whacked Harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical statues. 
Abandoning his toast, he got quickly to his feet and followed Uncle Vernon to the front door. 
"It's a lot to remember. 
On the threshold stood Aunt Marge. 
Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door. 
Harry was bursting to say that he'd rather live in an orphanage than with the Dursleys, but the thought of the Hogsmeade form stopped him. 
"I can see you haven't improved since I last saw you. 
"Do they use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy?" she barked across the table. 
"Er" Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge's back. 
Outside in the hall, he leaned against the wall, breathing deeply It had been a long time since he'd lost control and made something explode. 
It's normally just a fryup for me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after...." 
I had Colonel Fubster drown one last year. 
He emptied the bottle into Aunt Marge's glass. 
"You, boy," he snarled at Harry. 
They go and get themselves killed in a car crash (drunk, I expect)" 'They didn't die in a car crash!" said Harry, who found himself on his feet. 
"They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to be a burden on their decent, hardworking relatives!" screamed Aunt Marge, swelling with fury. 
For a moment, it looked as though words had failed her. 
"COME BACK IN HERE!" he bellowed. 
"She deserved what she got. 
There was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk, but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London. He'd never be able to drag his trunk all the way to London. 
Unless... He looked down at his wand, which he was still clutching in his hand. If he was already expelled (his heart was. now thumping painfully fast), a bit more magic couldn't hurt. 
Then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault and... begin his life as an outcast. 
It was a horrible prospect, but he couldn't sit on this wall forever, or he'd find himself trying to explain to Muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick. 
Gold lettering over the windshield spelled The Knight Bus. 
He looked around at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open. 
"This is where we was before you flagged us down," he said. 
Madam Marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps. 
"What, Voldemort?" said Harry, without thinking. 
"Anyway, they cornered Black in the middle of a street full of Muggles and Black took out 'is wand and 'e blasted 'alf the street apart, and a wizard got it, and so did a dozen Muggles what got in the way. 
"Gas explosion," grunted Ernie. 
"And now 'e's out," said Stan, examining the newspaper picture of Black's gaunt face again. 
Mind, I don't fancy 'is chances against them Azkaban guards, eh, Ern?" 
"Talk about summat else, Stan, there's a good lad. 
He couldn't help imagining what Stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights' time. 
"Thanks," Harry said to Ern. 
"Well," said Harry. "Bye then!" 
I can see 'is scar!" 
"Bye, Neville!" called Stan. 
Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom's lantern, and then into a small parlor. 
"I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. 
Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry. 
He was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now. 
"The Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry!" 
"Now, have a crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if Tom's got a room for you." 
'Perhaps You'll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year. 
THE FIREBOLT HAS AN ACCELERATION OF 150 MILES AN HOUR IN TEN SECONDS AND INCORPORATES AN UNBREAKABLE BRAKING CHARM. 
Instead of the usual display of goldembossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs, there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred copies of The Monster Book of Monsters. 
"Yes," said Harry, "I need" "Get out of the way," said the manager impatiently, brushing Harry aside. 
I thought we'd seen the worst when we bought two hundred copies of the Invisible Book of Invisibilitycost a fortune, and we never found them.... 
A small table was stacked with volumes such as Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate Yourself Against Shocks and Broken Balls: When Fortunes Turn Foul. 
But Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book; it showed a black dog large as a bear, with gleaming eyes. 
The manager pressed Unfogging the Future into Harry's hands. 
Plenty of Hogwarts students were arriving in Diagon Alley now, with the start of term so near. 
"Dad," said Ron simply. 
I'd hate to see what the Ministry'd do to me if I blew up an aunt. 
"Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with all my Hogwarts things." 
"Excellent!" said Harry happily. 
"Look at this," said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of a bag and opening it. 
"What's all that, Hermione?" Harry asked, pointing at not one but three bulging bags in the chair next to her. ,,Well, I'm taking more new subjects than you, aren't IF' said Hermione. 
"I really want an owl. 
Next to the glossy rats in the cage, he looked especially woebegone. 
"He was like that when Percy gave him to me," said Ron defensively. 
It took them nearly ten minutes to catch Scabbers, who had taken refuge under a wastepaper bin outside Quality Quidditch Supplies. 
As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn't carrying an owl. 
"He needs rest and relaxation! 
Ginny, who had always been very taken with Harry, seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him, perhaps because he had saved her life during their previous year at Hogwarts. 
"Hello, Percy," said Harry, trying not to laugh. 
"Hello, Harry, dear. 
"What do we want to be prefects for?" said George, looking revolted at the very idea. 
The door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was shouting. 
He hesitated, not wanting them to know he'd heard them arguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop, then move closer to the parlor door. "makes no sense not to tell him," Mr. Weasley was saying heatedly. 
Black is deranged, Molly, and he wants Harry dead. 
"Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. 
He wasn't happy about it, but he agreed." 
"We've got it," Fred whispered to Harry. 
Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people with one curse; Mr. and Mrs, Weasley obviously thought Harry would be panicstricken if he knew the truth. 
No, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was the fact that his chances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero. 
Now he's accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of Penelope Clearwater. 
"I've got something to tell you," Harry began, but they were interrupted by Fred and George, who had looked in to congratulate Ron on infuriating Percy again. 
This had only one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep next to the window. 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione checked on the threshold. 
"Who do you reckon he is?" Ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door shut, taking the seats farthest away from the window. 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. 
She finally lowered them to say, "Sirius Black escaped to come after you? 
A faint, tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere. 
Ron looked horrified. 
The train rattled, the rain hammered, the ind roared, but still, Professor Lupin slept. 
"We must be nearly there," said Ron, leaning forward to look past Professor Lupin at the now completely black window. 
The train was getting slower and slower. 
The compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over Harry's legs. 
"I'm going to go and ask the driver what's going on," came Hermione's voice. 
"Ouch!" said Neville. 
There was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering light filled the compartment. 
Harry's eyes rolled up into his head. 
Harry opened his eyes; there were lanterns above him, and the floor was shakingthe Hogwarts Express was moving again and the lights had come back on. 
He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor. 
Where's thatthat thing? 
Ginny and Neville looked back at him, both very pale. 
"It'll help. 
"Wellthat thingthe dementorstood there and looked around (I mean, I think it did, I couldn't see its face)and youyou "I thought you were having a fit or something," said Ron, who still looked scared. 
At long last, the train stopped at Hogsmeade station, and there was a great scramble to get outside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and Neville's pet toad croaked loudly from under his hat. 
"Shove off, Malfoy," said Ron, whose jaw was clenched. 
Professor McGonagall, Transfiguration teacher and head of Gryffindor House, was calling over the heads of the crowd. 
She settled herself behind her desk and said abruptly, "Professor Lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train, Potter." 
The thought of what Draco Malfoy would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture. 
Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguisesor even Invisibility Cloaks," he added blandly, and Harry and Ron glanced at each other. 
It was common knowledge that Snape ,anted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who hated Snape, was startled at the expression twisting his thin, sallow face. it was beyond anger: it was loathing. 
Harry, suddenly ravenous, helped himself to everything he could reach and began to eat. 
" Overcome with emotion, he buried his face in his napkin, and Professor McGonagall shooed them away. 
He always had trouble remembering the passwords. 
Through the portrait hole and across the common room, the girls and boys divided toward their separate staircases. 
They reached their familiar, circular dormitory with its five fourposter beds, and Harry, looking around, felt he was home at last. 
"Nearly wet himself," said Fred, with a contemptuous glance at Malfoy. 
Most of the prisoners go mad in there." 
"Anyway, we'll see how happy Malfoy looks after our first Quidditch match," said Fred. 
The only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other in a Quidditch match, Malfoy had definitely come off worse. 
"Get back, you scurvy braggart! 
The knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up, but the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though he pulled with all his might, he couldn't get it out again. 
The knight's rage seemed to vanish instantly. 
On! 
"How're we supposed to get up there?" 
You may not have seen me before. 
Next term we shall progress to palmistry. 
I shall move among you, helping and instructing. 
"What can you see in mine?" 
"A windfall, unexpected gold.' 
"The skull... danger in your path, my dear...." 
There was another tinkle of breaking china; Neville had smashed his second cup. 
Very little receptivity to the resonances of the future." 
"It looks like a Grim if you do this," he said, with his eyes almost shut, "but it looks more like a donkey from here," he said, leaning to the left. 
"Please, Professor, we've just had our first Divination class, and we were reading the tea leaves, and" "Ah, of course," said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning. 
"Yeah, I have," said Harry. 
"You don't know what you're talking about!" said Ron, starting to get angry. 
"I think Divination seems very woolly," she said, searching for her page. 
Right, follow me!" 
However, Hagrid strolled off around the edge of the trees, and five minutes later, they found themselves outside a kind of paddock. 
"How do we open our books?" Malfoy repeated. 
The class all shook their heads. 
"Shut up, Malfoy," said Harry quietly. 
"Hippogriffs!" Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them. 
"Now, firs' thing yeh gotta know abou' hippogriffs is, they're proud," said Hagrid. 
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren't listening; they were talking in an undertone and Harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lesson. 
"Yeh've got eye contact, now try not ter blink.... Hippogriffs don' trust yeh if yeh blink too much...." 
"Go on, then" roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriffs hindquarters. 
"They wouldn't fire him, would they?" said Hermione anxiously, not touching her steakandkidney pudding. 
"I'm allowed to walk across the grounds, " he said Pointedly. 
"Don' reckon they've ever had a teacher who lasted on'y a day before." 
"I'm takin' yer all back up ter school, and don' let me catch yeh walkin' down ter see me after dark again. I'm not worth that!" 
But Harry saw him wink at Crabbe and Goyle when Pansy had looked away. 
"Weasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these roots." 
Ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces. 
Tell me, boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours? 
"Hey, Harry," said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to borrow Harry's brass scales, "have you heard? 
But Malfoy's eyes were shining malevolently, and they were fixed Harry. 
"Want to leave it to the dementors, do you? 
If, as I don't doubt, he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poisoned." 
He trickled a few drops down Trevor's throat. 
Ron looked around. 
"How did you do that?" said Ron. 
Harry wasn't surprised; he could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books. 
"Couldn't hold these for me, could you?" 
Professor Lupin wasn't there when they arrived at his first Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. 
"Good afternoon," he said. 
Today's will be a practical lesson. 
"Cool, sit!" said Dean Thomas in amazement. 
Neville gave Professor Lupin a look of pure terror, and Seamus Finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively. 
"Couldn't have put it better myself," said Professor Lupin, and Hermione glowed. 
There was a great shout of laughter. 
The wardrobe wobbled more violently. 
How could you make a dementor less frightening? 
"Neville, we're going to back away," said Professor Lupin. 
There was a roar of laughter; the boggart paused, confused, and Professor Lupin shouted, "Parvati! 
There was another crack, and where he had stood was a bloodstained, bandaged mummy; its sightless face was turned to Parvati and it began to walk toward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising"Riddikulus!" cried Parvati. 
Crack! 
The legless spider had vanished. 
Let me See... five points to Gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggartten for Neville because he did it twice... and five each to Hermione and Harry." 
"Very well, everyone, an excellent lesson. 
Professor Lupin had deliberately stopped him from tackling the boggart. 
His next few lessons were just as interesting as the first. 
The story of the boggart assuming Snape's shape, and the way that Neville had dressed it in his grandmother's clothes, had traveled through the school like wildfire. 
There were seven people on a Quidditch team: three Chasers, whose job it was to score goals by putting the Quaffle (a red, soccersized ball) through one of the fiftyfoothigh hoops at each end of the field; two Beaters, who were equipped with heavy bats to repel the Bludgers (two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to attack the players); a Keeper, who defended the goal posts, and the Seeker, who had the hardest job of all, that of catching the Golden Snitch, a tiny, winged, walnutsized ball, whose capture ended the game and earned the Seeker's team an extra one hundred and fifty points. 
A large, dead spider was dangling from his mouth. 
Hermione, who disapproved of copying, pursed her lips but didn't say anything. 
"He's skin and bone! 
Lavender Brown seemed to be crying. 
"She got a letter from home this morning," Parvati whispered. 
"You know what day it is?" 
The whole class was gathered around Lavender now. 
"Well, not necessarily by a fox," said Lavender, looking up at Hermione with streaming eyes, "but I was obviously dreading him dying, wasn't l?" 
Harry still hadn't decided what he was going to say to Professor McGonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson, but it was she who brought up the subject of Hogsmeade first. 
"Please, Professor, II think I've lost "Your grandmother sent yours to me directly, Longbottom," said Professor McGonagall. 
"Professor, my aunt and uncleerforgot to sign my form," he said. 
Ron called Professor McGonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed Hermione; Hermione assumed an "allforthebest" expression that made Ron even angrier, and Harry had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were going to do first, once they got into Hogsmeade. 
"You know, the Halloween feast, in the evening." 
Dean Thomas, who was good with a quill, had offered to forge Uncle Vernon's signature on the form, but as Harry had already told Professor McGonagall he hadn't had it signed, that was no good. 
"II've got to go to the library, got to get some work done." 
Sneaking around on your ownwhy aren't you in Hogsmeade buying Stink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms like the rest of your nasty little friends?" 
A sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly fingers. 
"Yes," said Lupin slowly. 
"I would have thought that was obvious, Harry," he said, sounding surprised. 
Harry stared. 
Not only was this the last answer he'd expected, but Lupin had said Voldemort's name. 
Lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished question. 
"Really?" said Lupin, looking only mildly interested as he took another gulp of potion. 
"Some people reckon" Harry hesitated, then plunged recklessly on, "some people reckon he'd do anything to get the Defense Against the Dark Arts job." 
"Well, Harry, I'd better get back to work. see you at the feast later." 
"There you go," said Ron. 
"We got as much as we could carry." 
"Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were giving out free samples, there's a bit, look" "We think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts at the Three Broomsticks" "Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer, really warms you up" "What did you do?" said Hermione, looking anxious. 
And then Snape came in...." 
The portrait seemed to be closed. 
A moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there, sweeping toward the portrait; the Gryffindors squeezed together to let him through, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was. 
"Professor McGonagall, please go to Mr. Filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the Fat Lady." 
"Nasty temper he's got, that Sirius Black." 
"Do you think Black's still in the castle?" Hermione whispered anxiously. 
"The one night we weren't in the tower...." 
You can't just Apparate in here. 
"I want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking!" 
"Everything under control, sir." 
She's still very distressed, but once she's calmed down, I'll have Mr. Filch restore her." 
Professor Trelawney's room? 
"Frightened of what happened to the Fat Lady. 
Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer." 
"I know that, but we can't prove it," said Wood bitterly, "And we've been practicing all those moves assuming we're playing Slytherin, and instead it's Hufflepuff, and their style's quite different. 
"Diggory's put a very strong side together! 
We must keep our focus! 
We must win!" "Oliver, calm down!" said Fred, looking slightly alarmed. 
"Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!" he sighed as the gale outside pounded the windows. 
The third time this happened, Wood talked for so long that Harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for Defense Against the Dark Arts, and set off at a run with Wood shouting after him, "Diggory's got a very fast swerve, Harry, so you might want to try looping him" Harry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, pulled the door open, and dashed inside. 
Hermione went very red, put down her hand, and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears. 
Do you think this is all because of the boggart?" 
For a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him. Then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt uprightPeeves the Poltergeist had been floating next to him, blowing hard in his ear. 
The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for Wood's usual prematch pep talk, but it didn't come. 
It was getting harder and harder to hold his broom straight. 
"Brilliant!" he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the crowd. 
The dog had vanished. 
At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him, were standing beneath him. 
"You fell off," said Fred. 
"We lost by a hundred points" "Right? 
"Don't beat yourself up, Harry, you're still the best Seeker we've ever had." 
The team trooped out, trailing mud behind them. 
"Er" "What?" said Harry, looking from one to the other. 
"And it hitit hitoh, Harryit hit the Whomping Willow." 
The Gryffindor team visited again on Sunday morning, this time accompanied by Wood, who told Harry (in a hollow, dead sort of voice) that he didn't blame him in the slightest. 
Was the Grim going to haunt him until he actually died? 
His old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were dark shadows beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class as they took their seats, and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints about Snape's behavior while Lupin had been ill. 
"Don't worry. I'll speak to Professor Snape. 
Professor Lupin had brought along a glass box containing a hinkypunk, a little onelegged creature who looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke, rather frail and harmless looking. 
When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and headed for the door, Harry among them, but"Wait a moment, Harry," Lupin called. 
"They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at Hogwarts. 
In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye, and we were forbidden to go near it. 
"Did you hear about the dementors too?" said Harry with difficulty. 
"You made that dementor on the train back off," said Harry suddenly. 
"What defenses?" said Harry at once. 
"I don't pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors, Harry, quite the contrary..." 
"We can do all our Christmas shopping there!" said Hermione. 
He turned, halfway along the thirdfloor corridor, to see Fred and George peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked, oneeyed witch. 
"Don't tell me" said Harry, starting to grin. 
Astounded, Harry bent over it. 
Panting, Harry sped up, his face hot, his feet very cold. 
He was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates and boxes. 
He might not get another chanceQuickly and silently, Harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed the stairs; looking back, he saw an enormous backside and shiny bald head, buried in a box. 
The teachers have got to know!" 
"He can't be getting in through a passage," said Harry quickly. 
It is therefore advisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfall. 
"He'd have a job spotting Harry in this," said Ron, nodding through the mullioned windows at the thick, swirling snow. 
"Ohof course notbut honestly, Harry" "Seen the Fizzing Whizbees, Harry?" said Ron, grabbing him and leading him over to their barrel. 
Hogsmeade looked like a Christmas card; the little thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow; there were holly wreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the trees. 
They headed up the street, heads bowed against the wind, Ron and Hermione shouting through their scarves. 
The door of the Three Broomsticks had opened again. 
"Four pints of mulled mead" "Ta, Rosmerta," said Hagrid. 
"Lovely to see you again, I must say. 
Why hadn't it occurred to him that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers to& And how long were they going to sit there? 
"I certainly do," said Fudge. 
What could possibly be worse?" 
"You'd have thought Black and Potter were brothers!" chimed in Professor Flitwick. 
"Of course they were," said Fudge. 
Black was best man when James married Lily. 
"James Potter told Dumbledore that Black would die rather than tell where they were, that Black was planning to go into hiding himself... and yet, Dumbledore remained worried. 
Powers gone, horribly weakened, he fled. 
White and shakin', he was. 
And then he says, 'Give Harry ter me, Hagrid, I'm his godfather, I'll look after him' Ha! 
His bes' friends' son! 
"Black was taken away by twenty members of the Magical Law Enforcement 'Squad and Pettigrew received the Order of Merlin, First Class, which I think was some comfort to his poor mother. 
"I certainly believe his master's defeat unhinged him for a while. 
Yes, I was astounded at how little effect the dementors seemed to be having on himand he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place, you know. 
Harry had never given him a thought before. 
Crookshanks was spread out in front of the fire like a large, ginger rug. 
"You won't, will you, Harry?" said Hermione. 
Ron and Hermione shook their heads, looking apprehensive. 
And if you'd heard your mum screaming like that, just about to be killed, you wouldn't forget it in a hurry. 
Black isn't affected by Azkaban like normal people are. 
"You're going to take Malfoy's advice instead of ours?" said Ron furiously. 
Further discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn't what Ron had had in mind. 
"Hagrid, are you in there. 
Hagrid's sobs redoubled, but he shoved the letter toward Harry, who Picked it up and read aloud: Dear Mr. Hagrid, Further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in your class, we have accepted the assurances of Professor Dumbledore that you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident. 
Or' the other hand, there didn't seem to be any particular harm in Buckbeak. 
"You'll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid," said Hermione, sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid's massive forearm. 
"Won't make no diff'rence!" sobbed Hagrid. 
Scared of him! 
Harry stared at him. 
"I've not bin meself lately," said Hagrid, stroking Fang with one hand and mopping his face with the other. 
"Never bin anywhere like it. 
His eyes filled with tears. 
"I don' ever want ter go back ter Azkaban." 
Meanwhile, in the rest of the castle, the usual magnificent Christmas decorations had been put up, despite the fact that hardly any of the students remained to enjoy them. 
Harry reached for his glasses and put them on, squinting through the semidarkness to the foot of his bed, where a small heap of parcels had appeared. 
Ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents. 
"Well," said Harry, feeling stunned, "I'm betting it wasn't the Dursleys." 
He can't go giving students stuff like this" "That's why he wouldn't say it was from him!" said Ron. 
"I can't believe this," Harry muttered, running a hand along the Firebolt, while Ron sank onto Harry's bed, laughing his head off at the thought of Malfoy. 
"There wasn't a card or anything with it." 
Ron sighed exasperatedly. 
"It's the best broom there is, Hermione," he said. 
"Well... who'd send Harry something as expensive as that, and not even tell him they'd sent it?" said Hermione. 
"GETHIMOUTOFHERE!" Ron bellowed as Crookshanks's claws ripped his pajamas and Scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder. 
Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at Crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of Harry's bed, knocking it over and causing Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain. 
Harry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back into his trunk. 
Harry gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to examining the Firebolt, which he had brought down to the common room with him. 
For some reason this seemed to annoy Hermione as well; she didn't say anything, but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too had been criticizing her cat. 
Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick were there, along with Filch, the caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old and rather moldylooking tailcoat. 
I at once hastened from my tower, and I do beg you to forgive my lateness...." 
"We'll risk it, Sibyll," said Professor McGonagall inpatiendy. 
Professor McGonagall poked a large spoon into the nearest tureen. 
"He got a Firebolt for Christmas," said Ron. 
• A special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution because this theory constitutes the basis of all antispiritual philosophies. 
It was a bright, sunny Sunday. 
Faruq had gone to the forest for a picnic with his teacher and his classmates. 
Right next to his foot Faruq noticed an insect that looked very much like an ant. 
"This is our home," the termite explained "We build these ourselves." 
"But you are so small," objected Faruq. 
"If your friends are all the same size as you, how can you possibly make something as enormous as this?" 
He created us in such a way that we are able to do all these things. 
"I've heard your grandfather telling the neighbors about you." 
"Why didn't you come and talk to me before?" Asad inquired. 
That little package we weave is called a cocoon. 
Asad nodded thoughtfully "You mean all those colorful butterflies were once caterpillars before they grew wings?" 
"That's my little brother," smiled the caterpillar "In a while he'll weave a cocoon too, and one day he'll be a butterfly like me." 
Allah is Almighty, EverForgiving. 
"Fine, but how do you store food in such a small place?" he wondered. 
Of course, I don't have the brains to think all that out. I'm only a woodpecker. 
One of the seagulls glided slowly down and landed on the seat next to Jalal. 
"How did you like our flying display?" it asked. 
"I noticed that you were watching us very carefully. What's your name?" 
"We seagulls position ourselves according to the direction of the wind. 
Jalal was still not sure he quite understood: "I saw you up there in the air without moving your wings, just as if you were hanging there. 
"It's impossible for us to do that from our own knowledge," began the seagull. 
Jalal thought of another question: "Yes, you stay hanging in the air as though you were held up there by a string... 
We all do what we are told to do. 
Dear children, have you heard of a kind of bird known as megapode? When these birds have chicks to raise, it is always the male birds which look after them. 
The bird repeats this operation over and over again. 
No rivers or other running fresh water drain into it. In other words, there is no transfer of oxygen or nitrogen. 
Ahmad thought for a moment: "Yes, but what if they do see you? 
We should be very grateful to Him for that." 
It was great talking to you. If I come here another time, I'll visit you again." "I shall look forward to that. Nice to have met you. 
Goodbye, Ahmad..." croaked the frog as it hopped back into the bushes and disappeared from sight. 
"We are storks. 
Hameed had another question for his new friend, "You live close to human beings, don't you?" 
And we build nests on the top of trees and chimneys..." The other stork then stood up and said, "Sorry, Hameed, we have to be on our way again." 
Nabeel was watching television after returning home from school one day. 
"It's always cold. 
So how did you learn to swim?" 
"Hello Amir," said the voice, "Are you tired out?" 
This color change comes about through the distribution and collection of various substances and pigments in my nervous system. 
"I wonder what else is special about you?" 
Of course, I wouldn't have had any of these characteristics if Allah had not wanted me to. 
Tariq had gone to play at the house of his classmate, Kashif. 
It was such a lovable dog, and it was as though it was asking, "Don't you want to play with me?" 
This was an opportunity not to be missed. 
Our fur prevents heat from outside from reaching our skin. 
Of course, when the temperature rises our body heat rises too, and when we become too hot we get rid of the extra heat by hanging our tongues out and panting, so even on hot days we don't sweat, in spite of our thick fur." 
Dogs have an extraordinary sensitivity to smells. 
While his sister, his mother and his father were talking to the riding teacher, Farhan went to look at a horse which was eating grass. 
Farhan grinned back, "I'm sure what I have learned from you will be much more interesting for my sister than learning to ride, when I tell her about it!" 
If an enemy attacks a baby panda its mother will bite it with her powerful jaws and try to protect the baby that way. 
"When a baby kangaroo is born it is only one centimeter long. 
The nourishment it contains is different, too. 
Allah, Who created us, thought out the needs of our babies. 
Zaki was lying in the garden reading a book. 
That's all there is to it!" 
"Yes, Farooq," replied the duck: "Let me give you an example. Our friends the ice ducks are a regular target for an interesting hunting method used by seagulls. 
"After laying our eggs, it is also much easier to cover them with sand. 
"I see now," said Kashif, "that every living thing on the face of the earth is proof of Allah's supreme creation. 
"Allah gave me these spikes to protect myself from my enemies" explained the porcupine. 
There are certainly Signs in that for people who hear.' 
Mansoor and his mother were trying to decide where to spend their summer vacation. 
Mansoor was startled by a voice coming from one poster he was standing next to: 
Mansoor turned his head towards the voice. 
"I thought you were a giant snowman!" 
"We live in the world's coldest regions such as the North Pole, Northern Canada, Northern Siberia and the Antarctic." 
Think about it! 
If we lived in the desert, we'd be overcome by the heat and die. 
"This white color of ours ensures that we are protected from our enemies in the cold, icy environment we live in. 
Still, gaining detailed information about these living creatures further increases my astonishment at Allah's supreme creation." 
Now think about our white fur which makes us resemble snowmen. 
We very cleverly cover our noses with our white front paws. 
"We do that thanks to a different bodily system that Allah has given us fish," replied his friend. 
Of course we would never have had the power to develop these characteristics by ourselves unless Allah had willed that it should be so." 
But it doesn't look very thick." 
That allows us to move faster. 
Another characteristic of mucus is that it protects us against illness." 
Keratin is a hard, tough material which is formed by the death of old cells in the lower level that lose contact with their sources of food and oxygen." 
"Omar, as you can see, it is Allah, Who created everything, Who gives fish all their characteristics. 
People have noses to breathe with, and fish have gills. 
With these they use the oxygen in the water. 
Tawfiq thought he probably wasn't going out because the weather was so cold, even though he knew that normally he would go out even if it snowed because Rashad loved playing with snow. 
Rashad's mother met them cheerfully. "I was very pleased when I heard you were coming," she said. 
In spite of having to stay in bed and spend the vacation lying down, Rashad was very cheerful. 
Rashad continued with his explanation: "When I started thinking like that I wasn't unhappy any more. 
If the person involved is intelligent, he will always be aware he is being lied to. 
Another day, another chance event occurred and a reptile turned into a bird and started to fly. 
As you know, every living thing is made up of cells. 
Can lifeless matter come together to produce a living, laughing, thinking being? 
This is a totally ridiculous claim. 
Meanwhile, and simultaneously, all the other changes that are necessary for a starfish to turn into a fish took place. 
It is interesting that so far not one fossil has been found of the intermediate species that evolutionists claim to have existed. 
The truth is that they were all brought into being at some instant, with all their features in tact and with no imperfections. They are no different to members of their species which are alive today. 
Allah created them all. 
Evolutionists say that reptiles evolved from fish. 
Let us list just a few of the things that fish would need to survive on land: 
Fish use gills to breathe in water. 
About the Fish Called the Coelacanth 
In all their books and magazines they portrayed this fish as proof of their theory. 
When they were trying to explain how a gigantic dinosaur could fly, shouldn't they first have explained how a tiny insect was able to? 
Birds have feathers, but reptiles have scales. 
Selfish people lose such good feelings as love for their people and their families. 
That meant that there is a force pulling the apple to the ground, a force which he called "gravity." 
For example, the theory of evolution maintains that man is descended from apes. 
Evolutionists talk about the fossils of extinct ape species as if they belonged to creatures that were halfhuman and halfape. 
As people are often not well informed about this topic, they are prone to believe what evolutionists say. 
For example, the skull volume of Native Australians (Aborigines) is quite small, but this does not mean that they are halfape, halfhuman. 
The biggest difference between apes and human beings is that humans have souls and apes don't. 
Allah created only humans with such abilities, and He has not given animals any of these faculties. 
It could be a dessert that you enjoy eating, a game that you enjoy playing, or an outing with people you love. 
Since Allah is full of compassion for you, He always gives you pleasant and beautiful things. 
We must therefore be grateful to Allah for each moment of our lives. 
Why are you asking me these questions?" 
If we are in danger, we have a right to know." 
If the order to leave Rama was confirmed, they would be departing soon after dawn. 
With Francesca's knowledge of drugs it would have been well within her capability to give General Borzov something that would induce appendicitis symptoms. 
But would she have done something so ... so blatantly dishonest, just to enhance the value of their postmission media project? 
Takagishisan," Nicole said next with an urgent edge in her voice. 
"Are you all right? 
Once we find him we will clear out of Rama with great haste. And to answer your last question, no, this is not a ploy on the part of the crew to avoid compliance with the evacuation order." 
He turned to Admiral Heilmann and handed him the microphone. "Dammit, Otto," he muttered, "you talk to that bureaucratic nincompoop. 
Richard came over beside Nicole and showed her a tiny keyboard just above Prince Hal's buttocks. 
I've seen him stare at a simple food processing robot for over thirty minutes, trying without success to figure out how to use it. He would starve to death if nobody helped him." 
Come on, Francesca," Nicole replied as the two women climbed into the front seat of the icemobile, "he can't be that bad. 
After ail, he has to use all the crew computers and communication devices, as well as the image processing system onboard the Newton. So you must be exaggerating." 
According to Maxwell's assistant, that obsequious cipher named Mills, many people on Earth think our good Japanese doctor was kidnapped by the Ramans." 
They were driving steadily across the ice. 
The COG Executive Council has been called into special session for later this week," he answered after a puzzled hesitation. 
Nicole des Jardins did not listen to the rest of Francesca's conversation with Dr. Brown. 
While Francesca was completing her preparations, Nicole climbed the nearby stairway and studied the amazing city of skyscrapers. 
Yesterday we witnessed a terrible tragedy when journalist Reggie Wilson, risking his own life to save this reporter, was trapped inside the rover and was unable to escape the powerful claws of the crab biots. 
Tabori is working feverishly to build a larger, stronger cage that will go around the entire apparatus. 
They're all over that temporary hut we built. 
Sorry, I did not copy." 
I've never seen anything move so fast.... 
Richard then said that they were coming back to Beta to refuel. 
"I am not going back to Beta right now. 
"One other thing," Francesca added. 
There's at least one in each slice, with the biggest one always right around the plaza. 
"And if so, why did 1 do it?" 
But I don't need a confession from you. 
You almost sound religious," Francesca said. Nicole stared quietly at her Italian colleague. 
He was exploring in the dark. 
Only her feet and the very bottoms of her legs were safely resting on the barn floor. 
However, she tripped on one of the spheres and banged her knee as she fell. 
She won't be able to climb out. 
A single journal article in an obscure Swedish mental health publication the following year had contained the information that sizable doses of dimethyldexil would produce acute pain that simulated an appendicitis. As Francesca walked rapidly away from the barn in a northerly direction, her agile mind worked through all the possibilities. She was performing her usual risk/reward tradeoff. The primary issue she was facing, now that she had left Nicole in the pit, was whether or not to tell the truth about Nicole's fall. 
Because I was confused and frightened and the lights were flashing. And Richard had sounded so very concerned about our leaving. I thought it would be easier for us to all talk together at the helicopter. 
And what are my other choices:' Wakefield talked with us just outside the barn. 
She was nearing the Cylindrical Sea. 
She heard Janos Tabori's voice very faintly on the radio. 
It looks as if our vehicle is undergoing a maneuver. 
I'm close to the sea, maybe two minutes away," Francesca answered. 
Something must have happened to her." 
We need to have a meeting." 
I'll give you the details when you get here. 
This is one incredibly long maneuver," Richard said with a smile as he approached the others. 
"At least the Earth thinks that they do." 
"If the vehicle stays at this attitude and acceleration rate," Janos said with uncharacteristic seriousness, "then in nineteen more minutes it will be on an impact course." 
We are to take nothing except the crab biot and our personal belongings. 
But the televised account of Wilson's death has done its damage. 
If you don't think the Ramans have hostile intentions," Francesca interrupted, "then how do you explain this maneuver? 
It can't be coincidence. 
Right after General Borzov died, you openly expressed some concern that perhaps some 'higher force,' meaning the Ramans, might have had a hand in his death. 
But he has not answered the difficult questions. 
If it is heading for the Earth, I fear for my family, my friends, for all humanity. There is no way to predict what it might do. 
Nicole also remembered calling for Francesca and the painful, terrible fall. 
But if not, why had nobody discovered her? 
Under any circumstances, she would have been retrieved from the pit if they had found her. 
Nicole tried to imagine what it would feel like to weaken from hunger and then ultimately to perish. 
Nicole grew weaker and more despondent. 
Anawi Tiasso had indeed been beautiful and regal, a jetblack African woman of uncommon stature. 
She and her mother had discussed the Poro only slightly during the thirty hours since Nicole and the other girls had finished the ceremonies. 
He could not understand why she was so distraught. 
It was the only time Nicole had seen him cry since the death of her mother. 
Considering her situation, she was feeling amazingly cheerful and upbeat. 
She looked up to the roof of the barn and through it to the nondescript sky of Rama. 
Shakespeare made you into something you never were," she said out loud to the little robot as she bent beside it to insert Richard's baton in the OFF slot. 
And what else can you do, my little prince?" Nicole said. "What happens if I insert this pin in the slot marked c?" 
The robot activated, walked a few steps, and finally approached her left foot. 
Nicole huddled lifelessly in a corner. 
Nicole sat down in the comer and emptied the vial in one gulp. WATERS OF WISDOM Immediately Nicole's vision began to blur. 
"As a boy I went out to meditate the night that people landed on the moon. 
His teeth became vicious, long, his eyes yellow. 
She could spot movement in four different places. Close to the barn, a centipede biot was trudging slowly toward the south end of the building. 
Nicole was almost to the top. 
While she was on her final climb, she had a brief scare when the biot slipped a few centimeters back into the pit. 
Holding on breathlessly, she waited until the biot was stable and then crawled forward to the first segment that was on level ground. 
The melting of the Cylindrical Sea had substantially altered the weather patterns on Rama. The temperature had warmed up considerably. 
But even in that case, she said to herself, I should follow the same approach. 
To pass the time, Nicole took a sample of the sea and tested it. 
It had very few of the organic poisons found by the first Raman expedition. 
Anyway they're virtually all gone now. 
The lanterns were enclosed in transparent wrappings that were very flimsy and paperlike. 
Their level of technological development is totally inconsistent with this incredible spacecraft. 
Nicole was not willing to give up so easily. She took out her flask and made a drinking motion. Then Nicole pointed behind her at the dark tunnel. 
When her velvet friend eventually returned, it brought four associates. 
The melon was placed in front of Nicole. 
They clearly intended for her to stay where she was, at least for the time being. It had been a long time since Nicole had had any sleep and she was pleasantly full from the meal. 
Oh well, she thought to herself, curling up on the floor after a short internal debate, maybe a short nap will refresh me. 
In her dream she heard someone calling her name, but it was very far away. She had to strain to hear the voice. Nicole woke with a start and tried to remember where she was. 
When the thing turned and went in the opposite direction, Nicole pulled her head over the edge of the next level. The object was moving rapidly on treads and looked altogether like an armored tank from the rear. 
That tank is some kind of sentinel. 
After all, hadn't the creature invited her to visit after Nicole had saved its life? 
She was in luck. 
If she slipped ... 
Nicole reached the top ledge and started pushing on the covering. It wouldn't budge. 
"It just never occurred to me that I might see one of the crew again and still not be rescued" She stopped herself. 
I'm not usually this emotional," Nicole said. "And I interrupted your story right in the middle." 
"Do you remember, after one of the simulations, when the review board criticized us for not having sent a pilotless version of our motorboat into the water first, just to make sure that there wasn't something peculiar to the new design that would disturb the 'ecological equilibrium' in some way? 
Well, I thought their suggestion at the time was ridiculous. 
There's twentyfive square kilometers of territory inside these walls. 
And radio around here is completely unreliable." 
"He led me to you," Wakefield said. 
"I'll remember that when it rains." 
Lying about half a meter apart made their conversation very easy. 
What a boggle it would be to learn their secret. 
"Just think about what it would mean either way. 
She liked to savor the last part of her dream state before confronting harsh reality. At home Genevieve and Pierre both knew not to talk to her about anything important until after she had had her morning coffee. She blinked at Richard, who was shining his small flashlight in the gap between them. This space vehicle is now headed for the Earth," he said. 
In all the excitement last night," Richard replied, "I left out one of the most important points. 
The maneuverI guess you missed it because you were unconscious at the bottom of that pitput Rama on an Earth impact course. That made our evacuation imperative." 
The British engineer paused for a moment to reflect, "Francesca says that the polls on Earth are indicating that a huge majority of the average people as well, almost ten to one according to her, is terrified by Rama's approach. They are clamoring for the politicians to do something." 
Before she left, she told me she was convinced that none of us should ever have entered Rama in the first place. 
Richard grew moody and uncommunicative. 
Nicole rolled over and studied the robot from up close. 
The tiny face was definitely leering. It was crude, but very funny. 
But I would like to do one other thing first. 
Richard feigned hurt pride. "But whatever happened to tradition? 
"Tell me, Richard," she said, "where did this preoccupation of yours with Shakespeare come from? 
"When I was nine or ten, I would stop in that park along the Avonthe one beside all the theaters, with the statues of Hamlet, Falstaff, Lady Macbeth, and Prince Haland spend the afternoon hours making up additional stories about my favorite characters. 
Later on, when I was older, he never even tried. 
When I continued to argue with him, he suddenly hit me in the nose with all his might. I fell against the wall with my broken nose gushing blood. From that time on, until I was fourteen and felt I could protect myself, I never walked in that house when he was there unless I was certain that my mother was home." Nicole tried to imagine an adult man slugging an eightyearold child. 
But I still yearned for human interaction,' He looked over at Nicole and paused, remembering, "I made Shakespeare's characters my friends. 
He had not been successful. 
"I don't imagine a centipede biot is going to help us get off this island." 
Richard," Nicole said from above. "I think we should discuss this. I don't want to be stuck" 
Ahha!" Richard exclaimed. As soon as his foot hit the first landing, some lights around him automatically lit the next phase of the descent. "The ramp doubles back," he shouted, "and continues down. 
Nicole ran forward and tried to stop the motion of the cover, but it was much too heavy. 
"Richard," she cried as the hole disappeared beneath her. 
I'll take Moe," Nicole said. She headed toward one of the tunnels. When she was within a few meters of the entrance, the lights in the near portion of the tunnel switched on. 
"Don't feel bad, Nikki," he said. "I was scared shitless too. 
But I was frozen in place." 
"I thought it was time for me to have my own special name for you. 
Nicole was speechless for ten full seconds. Her mind was millions of kilometers and fifteen years away, in a hotel suite in Los Angeles, her body experiencing wave after wave of pleasure. 
They tensed briefly, but relaxed as the squeaking continued and there were no new surprises. 
The objects on the wall were photographs, most of them recognizable as having been taken somewhere inside Rama. 
Just think, the sum of everything all human beings know or have ever known might be nothing more than an infinitesimal fraction of the Encyclopedia Galactica" 
"All right, Nikki," he said with a wink. "Half a league onward." 
This is definitely the destination of the tunnels," Richard muttered to himself. 
Richard Wakefield," Nicole said from the rim of the hole, "are you trying to tell me that you intend to climb down into that chasm? 
To see if anyone has found us yet? 
"Hallooo, down there. 
He waved and momentarily lost his balance. 
Her two feet were resting on spikes and she was holding tightly to two others with her hands. / must be insane, she said to herself, just look at this place. 
"But what the hell does it mean?" 
He had climbed down as soon as he had seen the lower platform illuminated by lights. 
"Giants descend another floor and normalsize creatures take this subway. It's all very simple." 
Richard walked swiftly around the ring. "That's perfect," he said out loud, taking off his backpack and setting it on the ledge beside him. 
"I kept thinking of new things to add and I needed to rearrange the linkage ..." 
"How long have we been here?" she said as she yawned. 
"So here's the plan,' Richard said. 
Hal and Sir John each have audio, video, and infrared sensors that will acquire data continuously. 
"From time to time they will probably make some absurd random comments." The two robots stood on the subway for a minute or two. 
"The car itself," Richard said to Nicole after studying the image, "is less than two centimeters tall. 
I think the ferry covers about four hundred meters altogether," he said with a slightly puzzled expression. 
That would suggest to me a shell thickness of several hundred meters at least." Richard checked the monitor quickly. 
The room was immense. 
He clambered up the rest of the cylinder and started racing through the tunnel at the top, following the steps of Nicole far ahead of him in the distance. 
Richard had just taken two deep breaths and started to run again when his ears were assaulted by a terrible wail in front of him. 
It should have been obvious, of course, because the opening was on the wrong side. 
What the hell?" Richard had said, blinking twice, his curiosity only slightly stronger than his terror. 
Even though she had seen the sight before, the stuffed Takagishi was much too lifelike for her. 
Surely you are aware, as we sit here, that the odds do not favor our escape. 
And of course since my mother died when I was very young, even as a child I was forced to have some perspective on the subject." 
And to have quality we must be willing to take a few risks.... 
I'm not being very focused, am I?" 
Richard saw that Nicole was staring at him. "I have an idea," he said excitedly. 
For hours Richard Wakefield sat beside the two computers, mumbling to himself and trying to solve the puzzle of New York. 
Two hours before dark Richard dashed off hurriedly to an adjacent section to obtain extra data that had not yet been recorded on their computer maps. 
None of Richard's three solutions for the location of the third lair was close to the plaza. 
Or do we know the truth first, and then develop the mathematics to explain it? 
They used their flashlights to find their way, as no lights illuminated their descent. 
At least not yet," Nicole answered. 
"The biots, the avians, the octospidersmaybe they all came originally from the same planet. 
The avians may or may not be. 
Why are they different?" 
"Maybe we've met some of their creations. 
He was still struggling with the walkietalkie. 
"All we know at this point is that this spacecraft apparently received pictures from Rama I, and that reproductions of small, everyday objects that were carried by the Norton crew have been placed here in this room for us to find." 
The other eight keys contained either dots or geometrical figures on their surfaces and, in addition, could be set in either an "up" or "down" position. 
At Richard's suggestion, Nicole climbed out of the lair twice during the first Raman day they were in the White Room. 
She was standing outside the bam, in almost the exact spot where she and Francesca had talked to Richard on the communicator the last time. 
Nicole shouted again. 
It sailed far down, hitting a ledge somewhere near the second main level. 
When she yelled into the depths of the avian lair the second time, there was an immediate response. 
He had a grin on his face from one ear to the other and was holding one hand behind his back. "Wait until I show you what I have," he said as Nicole unloaded the backpacks. 
In less than a minute Richard had carefully drawn a cube in three dimensions. 
"There are vast tunnels beyond these walls," he said, "and they must lead to factories so advanced we couldn't even recognize them. 
Later, after she had carefully outlined all their options and asked his opinion about what they should do, she noticed that he had fallen asleep. 
Her only escape had been the pleasure of reading. 
Nicole remembered a long discussion with Genevieve after her daughter had read / Richard the previous summer. The young teenager had been fascinated by the story, and had surprised her mother by asking extremely intelligent questions. Thoughts of Genevieve made Nicole wonder what her daughter might be doing at Beauvois at the very moment. 
Nicole was feeling an undefined sadness as she trekked down the stairs to the second level and turned right at the horizontal tunnel. Her sadness changed to surprise when she entered the White Room. Richard jumped up from his small black chair and greeted her with a hug. 
I know I wanted to explain to you how very important Prince Hal and Falstaff were to me. They were my closest friends.... 
It was obvious that he acknowledged Nicole's mystical attributes as just another component in her rich personality. 
A few nights later, Nicole was lying with her head on Richard's chest, quietly drifting in and out of sleep. He was in deep thought. "Several days ago," he said, nudging her awake, "back before we became so intimate, I told you that I considered committing suicide once. At the time I was afraid to tell you the story. 
She accepted more from astonishment than love. 
I went to graduate school at Cambridge after the summer was over. We lived in a modest flat and she commuted to the theater in London. I would go with her whenever I could, but after several months my studies demanded more of my time." 
Richard stopped his narrative and glanced down at Nicole. 
Grocery shopping, for example, was a colossal bore. 
It was just too much trouble for her to turn on the set and decide what to order. 
I went to the station and took the late train to London. 
"I was worse than my father ever was. I would have killed them both if the people in the next flat hadn't restrained me." 
Neither of them said anything for several minutes. 
I was considering the gruesome alternativespills, slitting my wrists with a razor blade, jumping off a bridgewhen another student called to ask me a detailed question on relativity. 
Nicole wiped her eyes and placed her hands in his. She leaned her naked body across Richard's and kissed him. 
We have to decide what we're going to do. 
But I guess we have finally reached the point where we should consider swimming across." 
You don't think there's any chance of making a boat out of our black stuff?" 
The best laid plans of mice and men gang aft agley." 
There really were no reasons to pick one embarkation point over another. 
He has been an excellent companion. In every way. 
She walked over to him and put her arms around his neck. 
Nicole was in the middle of a beautiful dream. 
"There's no doubt about it The military ship is still docked," 
He threw his arms around Nicole and lifted her off the ground. 
Yes," he answered, "as I expected. 
"It's relatively straightforward, then, isn't it? 
"It only takes fifteen minutes by rover from the bottom of Alpha stairway to the Beta campsite." 
Without first seeing if they could spot us from the helicopter? 
That's unlikely." 
Richard turned his eyes to the sea and searched for a sail. 
Why not?" she said with a doubtful smile. We are going to build ourselves harnesses out of the lattice material and the avians are going to fly us across the Cylindrical Sea." 
"What are we going to do if they attack us?" They won't attack," Richard said, indicating for Nicole to open the cover. "But just in case, I want you to stay over there. 
At the end, however, Richard sensed that he had lost. 
As a pair of the other avians flew over the top of the tank sentinel, Richard climbed down into the lair, onto the first ledge. "Hold it," he shouted at the top of his lungs. 
"If, by some chance, the avians do not return for me," Richard told her, "don't wait forever. 
Once the lattice cord was at its full extension, the ride was fairly smooth. 
The rich cherry red of its rings was even clearer in the full daylight. 
Nicole then put her arms on Richard's shoulders and led him through a circular turn. 
It's less than three hours until dark," Nicole replied. "They may have returned to the Newton already." 
Do you think we should save any of the melon?" Nicole asked a few minutes later, while they were eating. 
"Even if we don't find that idiotic rescue bunch and must climb all the stairs ourselves, we'll still be out of here right after dark. 
Remember, we become weightless again at the top of the stairway." 
Technically I will not have violated their order." 
As always Francesca was recording the scene on her video camera. 
Don't take any unnecessary chances." Richard had been surprised by the general's warm smile. 
He had expected the American military officer to try to talk him out of leaving. "It's magnificent in Rama, General," Richard had said. "Like a combination of the Grand Canyon, the Alps, and the Pyramids all at once." 
A couple of those stupid Shakespearean robots. 
Surely one of the bombs would accomplish the desired result." 
There has to be a backup." 
The COG system engineering personnel had convinced the political leaders, and the world press, that one nuclear test was necessary "every twenty years or so" to ensure that all the old weapons would indeed fire in an emergency. 
O'Toole and his team had observed the demonstration, ostensibly to learn as much as possible about the effects of nuclear weapons. 
"I'm sorry, Otto," he said. "I was thinking about something else." 
I can't imagine it," O'Toole said quickly, "The weapons were included in the mission manifest solely to guard against openly hostile actions by the Ramans. 
No rational person really believes that Rama will actually hit the Earth." 
Sitting at the computer terminal in his room, the concerned O'Toole recalled the words of Armando Urbina, the Mexican peace activist who had advocated a total dismantling of the COG nuclear arsenal. 
An hour ago we received our orders. 
He glanced over at Otto Heilmann. 
ONCE A HERO Michael O'Toole could not sleep. 
He longed for a distraction, something that would make him forget his responsibilities and allow his soul some repose. 
Proceed with Trinity, he thought to himself at last, focusing on the true cause of his disquiet. 
It wouldn't take much more than a minute at each weapon, but it was by far the most important. 
He rose from the bed and walked over to his desk. 
He did not smile when he greeted the Newton officers. 
The general paused for the briefest of moments. "That is all," he then concluded. "Proceed with Trinity." 
"Should we have the crew meeting after dinner?" 
In the morning General O'Toole did not attend the scheduled crew meeting. 
They will be set to explode sixty hours after our scheduled departure. According to the analytical models, we should be out of the debris field in twelve hours, but for safety we have specified, in our procedure, that the weapons will not be exploded unless we are at least twentyfour hours away.... If our departure is delayed because of some crisis, we can always overwrite the detonation time by electronic command." 
"As long as we're inside Rama putting these things in their proper locations, I assume that it's all right if we look around for our lost friends. 
I'm looking at the executive software manual," Francesca replied. 
It's really not that complicated,' Francesca said with a laugh. 
She put a hand on his forearm. "Speaking of next careers, Michael, have you given any thought to yours?" 
I'm trapped in the usual professional dilemma, my dear friend. 
I would have found out sooner or later. 
"Which is about eighteen hours from now. 
I hope you've considered your decision very very carefully." 
General O'Toole spent the afternoon in his room, watching on the video monitor as Tabori and Yamanaka checked out the nuclear weapons. 
He must know, he was thinking as he waited impatiently for the call to connect. 
He was talking as if he were sitting beside General O'Toole in someone's cozy living room. I have been following your Newton mission with great interestas has everybody in my family, including Linda and the four kidsever since you launched. 
Now, I know that decisions like that are not made lightly, and that it places quite a large responsibility on folks like yourself. 
We were watching when you all were trying to capture that biot, the one that looked like a crab, and my, it was positively awful. 
As he prayed, he recalled another time, years before, when he had been a young pilot working as part of a temporary peacekeeping force in Guatemala. 
O'Toole and his men had awakened one morning to find their small air base in the jungle completely surrounded by the rightwing terrorists that were trying to bring the fledgling democratic government to its knees. 
Major O'Toole had taken fifteen minutes to deliberate and pray before deciding to fight it out. 
In Guatemala the young major had not had any questions about the morality of his actions His order to destroy Rama, however, was altogether different. In O'Toole's opinion, the alien ship had not taken any overtly bellicose actions. 
Under the word "Rama," the general found a host of different references in the concordance. The one that he was looking for was the only one marked in a bold font. 
It was, technologically speaking, as much beyond the understanding of its observers as Rama is today. In that sense there is a certain conforming pattern, a symmetry that is not inconsistent with God's order. 
For as I have told you many times, we are overdue for our final evolution, our recognition that the entire human race is but a single organism. 
But what about the other fortyone digits? 
Louder," shouted Francesca from where she was filming. She had neatly framed the ceremony so that both the weapons and the pods appeared in the picture. 
Francesca, however, did impress the rest of the crew by doing her first thirty digits from memory. 
O'Toole shook his head. "I thought I was this morning, Otto, but ..." 
He stared at his colleague for several seconds. 
They're already screaming for my hide?" O'Toole interrupted. 
There was a long hiatus in the conversation. 
The combined RamaNewton spacecraft continued to hurtle toward the Earth. 
Michael O'Toole was vilified by the global press. 
Kathleen O'Toole was forced to leave the family apartment in Boston and take refuge with a friend in Maine. 
The general was tortured by his indecision. 
Only Francesca and Janos were friendly, so General O'Toole returned to his room right after dinner without formally saying goodbye to anyone. The next morning, less than an hour after the scientific ship had left, O'Toole buzzed Admiral Heilmann and asked for a meeting. 
In response to some of your religious inquiries, however, I can make a few comments. 
On one last pass through the Beta campsite, O'Toole decided to pick up some odds and ends, including a few personal mementos left behind by the other crew members in their hasty retreat from Rama. 
General O'Toole took a long nap before he guided the rover back to the bottom of the chairlift. 
Realizing what he was going to do when he reached the Newton, O'Toole knelt down and prayed one last time before ascending. 
He thought he saw a moving black speck in the Raman sky. 
He quickly changed the binocular resolution and the speck split into three parts, each a bird soaring in formation far off in the distance. 
When Nicole told of her fright upon encountering the dead Takagishi in the octospider lair, O'Toole was momentarily silent and then shook his head. 
I don't want to ride in the dark any longer than is necessary." 
Cautious by nature with her expectations, until this moment in the chairlift she had not allowed herself the intense pleasure of believing that she would ever again hold her beloved Genevieve in her arms. 
O'Toole was convinced that his order to activate the weapons would then be rescinded. 
They waited for Richard Wakefield before proceeding together around the ramp to the ferry passageway, only a hundred meters away. 
Somehow they've brokenHis panic subsided an instant later when, after the third decade of digits, the red light announced that an error had been made. 
"Of course we can't rule out completely the possibility that the contraption might have been placed there by the aliens ... or even the biots." 
And why had they violated the toppriority project policy that at least one crew member should always stay onboard the Newton? 
"According to this, we have no video link with the Earth presently. 
He entered some commands. "It's going to take a while to straighten it out" 
Unless we see some evidence" 
"This videotape was triggered by your entering the Newton airlock. Cosmonaut Yamanaka and I prepared it just before we departed in one of the pods three hours before 19 days. 
Don't be concerned about the electronic devices in operation on the two bombs in the Raman shell. 
However, I must stress that the new pod navigation algorithms are valid only if you leave the Newton before 16 days. 
"They must have started only minutes after I left. Richard read the command buffers and found out that the decryption software was uplinked less than two hours after my departure." 
I'll know for certain in about twenty minutes." She smiled at the dumbfounded Richard. "It's extremely rare for a woman to become pregnant within ninety days of an injection of neutrabriolate. But it has happened before. 
There will be no more discussion of this subject,' General O'Toole said emphatically to Richard. 
"We all know it, don't we?" General O'Toole said in barely audible tone. "The missiles must be on their way. 
How long do you figure I have, Richard?" 
"What missiles are we talking about?" 
When it finally came, Richard frowned. 
There's one that Kathleen especially likes, if I can recall it. 
You didn't say anything to Michael about the problems you found with the pod navigation," Nicole said. 
Would you want to do that?" 
"But I don't think there's a major difference if we go together. 
I would bet that such a contingency plan was under development as soon as Rama changed course and headed for the Earth." 
Could he really justify the extra risk of his presence in terms of his extra skills? 
There was a solitary small light on the far wall, but otherwise the room was dark. 
Ronata," he said distinctly, "the prophecies must be heeded. 
I promise you that if I survive to give birth to our child, I will never cease telling her about the intelligence, wit, and sensitivity of her father. 
She stood up and rewound the tape. 
As she climbed into the rover and started to drive toward the Cylindrical Sea, Nicole thought about how she would communicate with the intelligence governing Rama. ,'// definitely use pictures, she said to herself, and wherever possible the precise language of science. 
Nicole carried the hull of the boat down the steps and placed it right next to the water. Each of the major substructures she assembled on the cliff above, where the light was brighter. 
Are you positive, Richard," Nicole asked, "that each of those blips represents an object in space?" 
I suppose they might be peace envoys, but I doubt it seriously." 
The two men stared at each other for several seconds. 
What's up?" Richard inquired a few moments later when he and Nicole joined the general at the foot of the stairway. 
Indulge me for a little while," O'Toole interrupted firmly. 
Richard pulled out his small computer and walked over beside O'Toole. 
"Why don't we just indicate the quantity of fissionable material in the process? 
Nicole showed O'Toole the bam with the pits, the lattice where she had rescued the avian, the stunning polyhedrons, and the entrances to the other two lairs. 
No, Michael," she answered. 
"Maybe that way I don't have to stay in Limbo with the virtuous pagans and unbaptized children." 
The American general was taking the baptism seriously but was apparently not offended by Richard's lighthearted banter. 
When O'Toole had finished baptizing Nicole in the same simple way, Richard stood up and grinned. 
Nicole looked up at him. 
General O'Toole stopped for just a moment and then began to recite the Lord's prayer. After he had said, "Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name" the lights in the great spaceship were abruptly extinguished. 
What should we do now? 
At that moment scattered flashes of light intruded upon the new blackness of the Raman night. 
It must be the horns," Richard answered excitedly. 
"Come on, let's go." 
Amazing," said O'Toole, overcome with awe. 
He could hardly contain himself. He hugged Nicole, then O'Toole, and finally kissed Nicole on the lips. "Whoopee!" he yelled as he danced along the wall. 
At least I think that was the reason.... 
He turned around. "Come on," he said, dashing down the steps three at a time. 
Nicole too was excited. 
Richard's frenetic activity increased. 
General O'Toole mumbled a very short prayer of thanks and joined his colleagues in front of the screen. 
Less than a second later a sharp lateral force hit them hard, knocking them to the floor. 
Richard came over beside Nicole and took her hand. A minute later they sat down together against the wall to wait for the next impacts. 
Nicole was thrown savagely into the wall, hitting it with the side of her head. 
I know how very liable we are to delusion in what relates to ourselves, and also how much the judgments of our friends are to be suspected when given in our favor. 
I knew the judgment which others had formed of me; and I did not find that I was considered inferior to my fellows, although there were among them some who were already marked out to fill the places of our instructors. 
I was thus led to take the liberty of judging of all other men by myself, and of concluding that there was no science in existence that was of such a nature as I had previously been given to believe. I still continued, however, to hold in esteem the studies of the schools. 
For to hold converse with those of other ages and to travel, are almost the same thing. 
Those in whom the faculty of reason is predominant, and who most skillfully dispose their thoughts with a view to render them clear and intelligible, are always the best able to persuade others of the truth of what they lay down, though they should speak only in the language of Lower Brittany, and be wholly ignorant of the rules of rhetoric; and those whose minds are stored with the most agreeable fancies, and who can give expression to them with the greatest embellishment and harmony, are still the best poets, though unacquainted with the art of poetry. 
For it occurred to me that I should find much more truth in the reasonings of each individual with reference to the affairs in which he is personally interested, and the issue of which must presently punish him if he has judged amiss, than in those conducted by a man of letters in his study, regarding speculative matters that are of no practical moment, and followed by no consequences to himself, farther, perhaps, than that they foster his vanity the better the more remote they are from common sense; requiring, as they must in this case, the exercise of greater ingenuity and art to render them probable. 
So that the greatest advantage I derived from the study consisted in this, that, observing many things which, however extravagant and ridiculous to our apprehension, are yet by common consent received and approved by other great nations, I learned to entertain too decided a belief in regard to nothing of the truth of which I had been persuaded merely by example and custom; and thus I gradually extricated myself from many errors powerful enough to darken our natural intelligence, and incapacitate us in great measure from listening to reason. 
But after I had been occupied several years in thus studying the book of the world, and in essaying to gather some experience, I at length resolved to make myself an object of study, and to employ all the powers of my mind in choosing the paths I ought to follow, an undertaking which was accompanied with greater success than it would have been had I never quitted my country or my books. 
For my own part, I should doubtless have belonged to the latter class, had I received instruction from but one master, or had I never known the diversities of opinion that from time immemorial have prevailed among men of the greatest learning. 
My second maxim was to be as firm and resolute in my actions as I was able, and not to adhere less steadfastly to the most doubtful opinions, when once adopted, than if they had been highly certain; imitating in this the example of travelers who, when they have lost their way in a forest, ought not to wander from side to side, far less remain in one place, but proceed constantly towards the same side in as straight a line as possible, without changing their direction for slight reasons, although perhaps it might be chance alone which at first determined the selection; for in this way, if they do not exactly reach the point they desire, they will come at least in the end to some place that will probably be preferable to the middle of a forest. 
Besides, the three preceding maxims were founded singly on the design of continuing the work of selfinstruction. For since God has endowed each of us with some light of reason by which to distinguish truth from error, I could not have believed that I ought for a single moment to rest satisfied with the opinions of another, unless I had resolved to exercise my own judgment in examining these whenever I should be duly qualified for the task. Nor could I have proceeded on such opinions without scruple, had I supposed that I should thereby forfeit any advantage for attaining still more accurate, should such exist. 
I had long before remarked that, in relation to practice, it is sometimes necessary to adopt, as if above doubt, opinions which we discern to be highly uncertain, as has been already said; but as I then desired to give my attention solely to the search after truth, I thought that a procedure exactly the opposite was called for, and that I ought to reject as absolutely false all opinions in regard to which I could suppose the least ground for doubt, in order to ascertain whether after that there remained aught in my belief that was wholly indubitable. 
But this could not be the case withthe idea of a nature more perfect than myself; for to receive it from nothing was a thing manifestly impossible; and, because it is not less repugnant that the more perfect should be an effect of, and dependence on the less perfect, than that something should proceed from nothing, it was equally impossible that I could hold it from myself: accordingly, it but remained that it had been placed in me by a nature which was in reality more perfect than mine, and which even possessed within itself all the perfections of which I could form any idea; that is to say, in a single word, which was God. 
For in order to know the nature of God (whose existence has been established by the preceding reasonings), as far as my own nature permitted, I had only to consider in reference to all the properties of which I found in my mind some idea, whether their possession was a mark of perfection; and I was assured that no one which indicated any imperfection was in him, and that none of the rest was awanting. 
For, when I examined the kind of functions which might, as consequences of this supposition, exist in this body, I found precisely all those which may exist in us independently of all power of thinking, and consequently without being in any measure owing to the soul; in other words, to that part of us which is distinct from the body, and of which it has been said above that the nature distinctively consists in thinking, functions in which the animals void of reason may be said wholly to resemble us; but among which I could not discover any of those that, as dependent on thought alone, belong to us as men, while, on the other hand, I did afterwards discover these as soon as I supposed God to have created a rational soul, and to have annexed it to this body in a particular manner which I described. 
Nor do we need to seek any other reason for the number of these pellicles beyond this that the orifice of the venous artery being of an oval shape from the nature of its situation, can be adequately closed with two, whereas the others being round are more conveniently closed with three. 
This physician likewise abundantly establishes what he has advanced respecting the motion of the blood, from the existence of certain pellicles, so disposed in various places along the course of the veins, in the manner of small valves, as not to permit the blood to pass from the middle of the body towards the extremities, but only to return from the extremities to the heart; and farther, from experience which shows that all the blood which is in the body may flow out of it in a very short time through a single artery that has been cut, even although this had been closely tied in the immediate neighborhood of the heart and cut between the heart and the ligature, so as to prevent the supposition that the blood flowing out of it could come from any other quarter than the heart. 
But in this I have adopted the following order: first, I have essayed to find in general the principles, or first causes of all that is or can be in the world, without taking into consideration for this end anything but God himself who has created it, and without educing them from any other source than from certain germs of truths naturally existing in our minds In the second place, I examined what were the first and most ordinary effects that could be deduced from these causes; and it appears to me that, in this way, I have found heavens, stars, an earth, and even on the earth water, air, fire, minerals, and some other things of this kind, which of all others are the most common and simple, and hence the easiest to know. 
For though it be true that every one is bound to promote to the extent of his ability the good of others, and that to be useful to no one is really to be worthless, yet it is likewise true that our cares ought to extend beyond the present, and it is good to omit doing what might perhaps bring some profit to the living, when we have in view the accomplishment of other ends that will be of much greater advantage to posterity. 
I will not hesitate even to avow my belief that nothing further is wanting to enable me fully to realize my designs than to gain two or three similar victories; and that I am not so far advanced in years but that, according to the ordinary course of nature, I may still have sufficient leisure for this end. 
It may be said, that these oppositions would be useful both in making me aware of my errors, and, if my speculations contain anything of value, in bringing others to a fuller understanding of it; and still farther, as many can see better than one, in leading others who are now beginning to avail themselves of my principles, to assist me in turn with their discoveries. 
And I think I may say without vanity, that if there is any one who can carry them out that length, it must be myself rather than another: not that there may not be in the world many minds incomparably superior to mine, but because one cannot so well seize a thing and make it one's own, when it has been learned from another, as when one has himself discovered it. 
I am glad, by the way, to take this opportunity of requesting posterity never to believe on hearsay that anything has proceeded from me which has not been published by myself; and I am not at all astonished at the extravagances attributed to those ancient philosophers whose own writings we do not possess; whose thoughts, however, I do not on that account suppose to have been really absurd, seeing they were among the ablest men of their times, but only that these have been falsely represented to us. 
But even superior men have no reason for any great anxiety to know these principles, for if what they desire is to be able to speak of all things, and to acquire a reputation for learning, they will gain their end more easily by remaining satisfied with the appearance of truth, which can be found without much difficulty in all sorts of matters, than by seeking the truth itself which unfolds itself but slowly and that only in some departments, while it obliges us, when we have to speak of others, freely to confess our ignorance. 
These considerations taken together were the reason why, for the last three years, I have been unwilling to publish the treatise I had on hand, and why I even resolved to give publicity during my life to no other that was so general, or by which the principles of my physics might be understood. But since then, two other reasons have come into operation that have determined me here to subjoin some particular specimens, and give the public some account of my doings and designs. 
Of these considerations, the first is, that if I failed to do so, many who were cognizant of my previous intention to publish some writings, might have imagined that the reasons which induced me to refrain from so doing, were less to my credit than they really are; for although I am not immoderately desirous of glory, or even, if I may venture so to say, although I am averse from it in so far as I deem it hostile to repose which I hold in greater account than aught else, yet, at the same time, I have never sought to conceal my actions as if they were crimes, nor made use of many precautions that I might remain unknown; and this partly because I should have thought such a course of conduct a wrong against myself, and partly because it would have occasioned me some sort of uneasiness which would again have been contrary to the perfect mental tranquillity which I court. 
And I thought that it was easy for me to select some matters which should neither be obnoxious to much controversy, nor should compel me to expound more of my principles than I desired, and which should yet be sufficient clearly to exhibit what I can or cannot accomplish in the sciences. 
Nor must it be imagined that I here commit the fallacy which the logicians call a circle; for since experience renders the majority of these effects most certain, the causes from which I deduce them do not serve so much to establish their reality as to explain their existence; but on the contrary, the reality of the causes is established by the reality of the effects. 
As to the opinions which are truly and wholly mine, I offer no apology for them as new,persuaded as I am that if their reasons be well considered they will be found to be so simple and so conformed, to common sense as to appear less extraordinary and less paradoxical than any others which can be held on the same subjects; nor do I even boast of being the earliest discoverer of any of them, but only of having adopted them, neither because they had nor because they had not been held by others, but solely because reason has convinced me of their truth. 
In the next place, in what way would old age have been less disagreeable to them if they were in their eighthundredth year than in their eightieth? 
In his second consulship, though his colleague would not move in the matter, he resisted as long as he could the proposal of the tribune C. Flaminius to divide the territory of the Picenians and Gauls in free allotments in defiance of a resolution of the Senate. Again, though he was an augur, he ventured to say that whatever was done in the interests of the State was done with the best possible auspices, that any laws proposed against its interest were proposed against the auspices. 
What weighty maxims! 
Whither have swerved the souls so firm of yore? 
For he would of course not have been practising rapid marches, nor dashing on a foe, nor hurling spears from a distance, nor using swords at close quartersbut only counsel, reason, and senatorial eloquence. 
Pray, who are those who brought your State With such despatch to meet its fate? 
Thereupon the old poet is said to have read to the judges the play he had on hand and had just composedthe _Oedipus Coloneus_and to have asked them whether they thought that the work of a man of weak intellect. 
Yes, and perhaps much that gives him pleasure too. Besides, as to subjects for tears, he often comes upon them in youth as well. 
No greater misery can of age be told Than this: be sure, the young dislike the old. 
Nor, again, do I now MISS THE BODILY STRENGTH OF A YOUNG MAN (for that was the second point as to the disadvantages of old age) any more than as a young man I missed the strength of a bull or an elephant. 
Xenophon’s Cyrus, for instance, in his discourse delivered on his deathbed and at a very advanced age, says that he never perceived his old age to have become weaker than his youth had been. 
Therefore, both by law and custom, men of my time of life are exempt from those duties which cannot be supported without bodily strength. 
But, it will be said, many old men are so feeble that they cannot perform any duty in life of any sort or kind. That is not a weakness to be set down as peculiar to 61d age: it is one shared by ill health. 
Listen, my dear young friends, to a speech of Archytas of Tarentum, among the greatest and most illustrious of men, which was put into my hands when as a young man I was at Tarentum with Q. Maximus. 
So I used to dine at their feast with the members of my clubon the whole with moderation, though there was a certain warmth of temperament natural to my time of life; but as that advances there is a daily decrease of all excitement. 
For myself, I take delight even in the oldfashioned appointment of master of the feast; and in the arrangement of the conversation, which according to ancestral custom is begun from the last place on the lefthand couch when the wine is brought in; as also in the cups which, as in Xenophon’s banquet, are small and filled by driblets; and in the contrivance for cooling in summer, and for warming hy the winter sun or winter fire. 
Indeed, if it has in store any of what I may call the food of study and philosophy, nothing can be pleasanter than an old age of leisure. We were witnesses to C. Gallusa friend of your father’s, Scipiointent to the day of his death on mapping out the sky and land. 
Than that intellectual pleasure none certainly can be greater. 
For my part, however. it is not merely the thing produced, but the earth’s own force and natural productiveness that delight me. For received in its bosom the seed scattered broadcast upon it, softened and broken up, she first keeps it concealed therein (hence the harrowing which accomplishes this gets its name from a word meaning “to hide”); next, when it has been warmed by her heat and close pressure, she splits it open and draws from it the greenery of the blade. This, supported by the fibres of the root, little by little grows up, and held upright by its jointed stalk is enclosed in sheaths, as being still immature. When it has emerged from them it produces an ear of corn arranged in order, and is defended against the pecking of the smaller birds by a regular palisade of spikes. 
Was these men’s old age an object of pity who found their pleasure in the cultivation of the land? 
So that he had an official career lasting the number of years which our ancestors defined as coming between birth and the beginning of old age. 
It is natural, then, that a man should have had influence, in whose praise the verdict of history is unanimous. 
A third alternative, at any rate, cannot possibly be discovered. Why then should I be afraid if I am destined either not to be miserable after death or even to be happy? 
Whatever time each is granted for life, with that he is bound to be content. 
For the word “spring” in a way suggests youth, and points to the harvest to be: the other seasons are suited for the reaping and storing of the crops. 
Again, there may possibly be some sensation of dying and that only for a short time, especially in the case of an old man: after death, indeed, sensation is either what one would desire, or it disappears altogether. 
I used to be told that Pythagoras and the Pythagoreansalmost natives of our country, who in old times had been called the Italian school of philosophersnever doubted that we had souls drafted from the universal Divine intelligence. 
Such are the words of the dying Cyrus. 
But my soul, I know not how, refusing to be kept down, ever fixed its eyes upon future ages, as though from a conviction that it would begin to live only when it had left the body. 
But had it not been the case that souls were immortal, it would not have been the souls of all the best men that made the greatest efforts after an immortality of fame. 
Now, old age is as it were the playing out of the drama, the full fatigue of which we should shun, especially when we also feel that we have had more than enough of it. 
'I thought you were up on the second floor… don't you do something that involves sneaking Muggle artefacts home and bewitching them?' 
'Don't think it hasn't occurred to us, Harry' said Mr Weasley quietly. 
'We'll tell him, don't worry.' 
Molly, I'll be late, I'm covering for Tonks, but Kingsley might be dropping in for dinner' 'He got off, he got off, he got off …" That's enoughFredGeorgeGinny!' said Mrs Weasley, as Mr Weasley left the kitchen. 
Or even looked at me.' And as he thought this, the scar on his forehead burned so badly that he clapped his hand to it. 
'And he probably felt a bit guilty himself, because I think a part of him was really hoping you'd be expelled. 
But I sometimes think Rons mums right and Sirius gets confused about 
'You were so keen to help the Order,' said Mrs Weasley, 'you can do your bit by making Headquarters fit to live in.' 
The fact was that living at the Headquarters of the antiVoldemort movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as Harry would have expected before he'd experienced it. 
He then opened his letter. 
'Because it means Dumbledore's found a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher,' said George. 
'Not surprising, is it, when you look at what's happened to the last four?' said George. 
'No way,' said George in a hushed voice. 
'Winning the Triwizard and everything!' said Fred. 
Well, at least one of you's got their priorities right.' 
A large T' was superimposed on the Gryffindor lion. 
Ron, I'll have to get you more pyjamas, these are at least six inches too short, I can't believe how fast you're growing… what colour would you like?' 
'We've already bought him some,' said Fred sourly, who looked as though he sincerely regretted this generosity. 
Mrs Weasley's face fell slightly; broomsticks were expensive. 
And don't forget to pack your trunks… a prefect… oh, I'm all of a dither!' 
'Going to put us in detention?' 
And with another loud crack, the twins Disapparated. 
For some reason, Harry found he did not want to look at THE WOES OF MRS WE A SLEY 1^ Hermione. 
They'll be really pleasedI mean prefect is something they can understand.' 
Not this, said a small and truthful voice inside his head. 
They didn't take on Riddle and the Basilisk. 
'Nah, I've caused too much trouble,' Harry said, echoing Fred. 
'I need scarcely say that 1 failed dismally.' 
Harry's mood suddenly lifted. 
All at once the party seemed much more enjoyable; he loaded up his plate, feeling doubly fond of everyone in the room. 
Mundungus stopped talking when he saw Harry, but Fred winked and beckoned Harry closer. 
It was full of what looked like shrivelled black pods. 
'I'm sorry, lads, but I'm not taking a Knut under twenty.' 
Giving l he twins his Triwizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time, but what if it led to another family row and a Percylike estrangement? 
'Well, I think I'll sort out that Boggart before I turn in… Arthur, 1 don't want this lot up too late, all right? 
Night, Harry, dear.' 
His mother and father were beaming up at him, sitting on either side of a small, wateryeyed man whom Harry recognised at once as Wormtail, the one who had betrayed his parents' whereabouts to Voldemort and so helped to bring about their deaths. 
Harry crossed the kitchen, slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call him back. 
Sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a patch of moonlight, clearly dead, was Ron. 
Crack. 
'Harry, I'm so sorry. 
He knew Moody was still watching him. 
And I'm not sure I'll be accepting their apology,' he added bitterly. 
But Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him some ten HARRY Pun ER minutes later, could not think Mrs Weasley silly. 
'Guard?' said Harry. 
'Why?' said Harry irritably. 
Mrs Weasley bellowed and Hermione jumped as though scalded and hurried out of the room. 
CREATURES OF DIRT!''Leave your trunk and your owl, Alastor's going to deal with the luggage… oh, for heaven's sake, Sinus, Dumbledore said no!' 
Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar… he was really going back… '1 hope the others make it in time,' said Mrs Weasley anxiously, staring behind her at the wroughtiron arch spanning the platform, through which new arrivals would come. 
'No trouble?' growled Moody. 
'Had a good summer, Luna?' Ginny asked. 
'Oh… hello, Harry,' said a nervous voice. 
'And guess who's a Slytherin prefect?' said Ron, still with his eyes closed. 
Ron stared at the cover with his mouth hanging open for a few seconds, then looked around at Ginny for some kind of explanation, but Ginny had 
Luna laughed so hard her magazine slipped out of her grasp, slid down her legs and on to the floor. 
Her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath, staring at Ron. 
'Baboon's… backside!' she choked, holding her ribs. 
The headline on the article said: SIRIUSBLACK AS HE'S PAINTED? 
Forfourteen years Sirius Black has been believed guilty of the mass murder of twelve innocent Muggles and one wizard. 
'Of course not,' said Hermione scathingly, before Harry could answer. 
Harry looked around; he had expected this, but that did not make the sight of Draco Malfoy smirking at him from between his cronies Crabbe and Goyle any more enjoyable. 
They shuffled out of the compartment feeling the first sting of the night air on their faces as they joined the crowd in the corridor. 
All firstyears to me!' 
Jostled by the crowd, Harry squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of Hagrid; he had to be here, Harry had been relying on itseeing Hagrid again was one of the things he'd been looking forward to most. 
But there was no sign of him. 
He can't have left, Harry told himself as he shuffled slowly through a narrow doorway on to the road outside with the rest of the crowd. 
They were completely fleshless, their black coats clinging to their skeletons, of which every bone was visible. 
'He'd better be OK…' A short distance away, Draco Malfoy, followed by a small gang of cronies including Crabbe, Goyle and Pansy Parkinson, was pushing some timidlooking secondyears out of the way so that he and his friends could get a coach to themselves. 
They were, after all, about three feet from the nearest one; it was watching them with empty white eyes. 
It's right there in front' But as Ron continued to look bemused, a strange thought occurred to Harry. 
'I… yeah…' Harry felt utterly bewildered. 
You're just as sane as I am: Smiling faintly, she climbed into the musty interior of the carriage after Ron. 
'Well, we in Ravenclaw think he's a bit of a joke,' said Luna, unlazed. 
If Luna was to be believed, the beasts had always been there but invisible. 
Unless it was the second pair Of Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw? 
The terrifiedlooking boy Harry had noticed earlier stumbled forwards and put the Hat on his head; it was only prevented from falling right down to his shoulders by his very prominent ears. 
'Of course, it lives in Dumbledore's office, so I daresay it picks things up there.' 
In spite of the competitiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin, 1 would never dream of seeking an argument with the Bloody Baron.' 
The noble blood that runs in my veins' 
Dumbledore continued, Tryouts for the house Quidditch teams will take place on the' He broke off, looking enquiringly at Professor Umbridge. 
No new teacher had ever interrupted Dumbledore before. 
Many of the students were smirking; this woman obviously did not know how things were done at Hogwarts. 
She smiled, revealing very pointed teeth. 
Harry glanced around. 
'I am very much looking forward to getting to know you all and I'm sure we'll be very good friends!' 
She sounded much more businesslike and now her words had a dull learnedbyheart sound to them. 
The ancient skills unique to the wizarding community must be passed down the generations lest we lose them tor ever. 
Over on the Ravenclaw table Cho Chang was chatting animatedly with her friends. 
Dumbledore clapped. 
'Well, they are, they're titchy…' 'I know, but you can't call them midgets! 
Euan Abercrombie looked equally frightened and stole a horrified look at Harry, who felt the grin slide off his face like Stinksap. 
He kept his eyes fixed ahead as he wove his way through the crowd in the Entrance Hall, then he hurried up the marble staircase, took a couple of concealed short cuts and had soon left most of the crowds behind. 
He knew that Seamus's mother was a witch and could not understand, therefore, why she should have come over so Dursleyish. 
'He's having a go at my mother!' Seamus yelled. 
They don't know nothing about no deaths at Hogwarts, because I'm not stupid enough to tell them.' 
'You don't know my mother, she'd weasel anything out of anyone!' Seamus snapped at him. 
He climbed into bed and pulled the covers up to his chin, looking owlishly over them at Seamus. 
She says if Dumbledore says he's back, he's back.' 
Nobody else said anything. 
'What's the matter?' asked Hermione five minutes later, catching up with Harry and Ron halfway across the common room as they all headed towards breakfast. 
(We regret that all work is undertaken at applicant's own risk.) 
'Sorry,' said Harry in a low voice. 
'If that means we're supposed to get matey with the Slytherinsfat chance.' 
They followed the Ravenclaws into the Great Hall, all looking instinctively at the staff table as they entered. 
Angelina smiled at him and departed. 
With a whoosh and a clatter, hundreds of owls came soaring in through the upper windows. 
'I'm not bothering… load of rubbish.' 
'Fair point, little bro,' said Fred, scanning the column. 
'But we feel our futures lie outside the world of academic achievement.' 
'We're not going to waste our last year here, though,' said Fred, looking afiectionately around at the Great Hall. 
'You're going to need all the ingredients and materialsand premises too, I suppose…" Harry did not look at the twins. 
Harry emerged from under the table to see Fred and George walking away, each carrying a stack of toast. 
'What did that mean?' said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron. 
'An Auror's worthwhile!' said Harry. 
'How would it be,' she asked them coldly, as they left the classroom for break (Binns drifting away through the blackboard), 'if I refused to lend you my notes this year?' 
A fine misty drizzle was falling, so that the people standing in huddles around the edges of the yard looked blurred at the edges. 
This was most unusual: Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls; Harry remembered the agony 
The moment he had said this he wished he hadn'tCedric had been Cho's boyfriend and the memory of his death must have affected her holiday almost as badly as it had affected Harrys. 
Hermione waited until Cho was halfway across the courtyard before rounding on Ron. 
He filed into the classroom behind Ron and Hermione and followed them to their usual table at the back, where he sat down between Ron and Hermione and ignored the huffy, irritable noises now issuing from both of them. 
'Potter, what is this supposed to be?' 
Harry squinted at the blackboard; it was not easy to make out the instructions through the haze of multicoloured steam now filling the dungeon. 
Those of you who have managed to read the instructions, fill one flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name and bring it up to my desk for testing,' said Snape. 
The ceiling had turned an even murkier grey during the morning. 
'Your potion wasn't nearly as bad as Goyle's; when he put it in his flagon the whole thing shattered and set his robes on fire.' 
He walked up the marble staircase two steps at a time, past the many students hurrying towards lunch. 
Serve them right, he thought, why can't they give it a rest … bickering all the time… it's enough to drive anyone up the wall … He passed the large picture of Sir Cadogan the knight on a landing; Sir Cadogan drew his 
Harry spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone underneath the trapdoor at the top of North Tower. 
I have, of course, been following your fortunes most carefully over the holidays, and am delighted to see that you have all returned to Hogwarts safelyas, of course, I knew you would. 
He knew perfectly well what his regular nightmare about a graveyard meant, he did not need Ron or Professor Trelawney or the stupid Dream Oracle to tell him. 
'What do you reckon that means?' 
'Do you realise how much homework we've got already? 
Professor Umbridge opened her handbag, extracted her own wand, which was an unusually short one, and tapped the blackboard sharply with it; words appeared on the board at once: Defence Against the Dark Arts A Return to Basic Principles 'Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented, hasn't it?' stated Professor Umbridge, turning to face the class with her hands clasped neatly in front of her. 
Placing the use of defensive magic in a context for practical use. 
For a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching quills on parchment. 
When everyone had copied down Professor Umbridge's three course aims she asked, 'Has everybody got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?' 
'Yes, Professor Umbridge,' rang through the room. 
Harry looked right and received a surprise to shake him out of his torpor. 
The chapter they had been instructed to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch Hermione's mute attempt to catch Professor Umbridge's eye rather than struggle on with 'Basics for Beginners'. 
'Not about the chapter, no,' said Hermione. 
'It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you, he actually performed them on you.' 
'Your hand is not up, Mr Thomas!' trilled Professor Umbridge. 
And your name is?' she added, staring at Parvati, whose hand had just shot up. 
She was staring at Harry with a grimly satisfied expression on her face. 
'MrPotteryouhavealreadylostyourhousetenpointsdonotmakemattersworseforyourself,' said Professor Umbridge in one breath without looking at him. 
'Detention, Mr Potter!' said Professor Umbridge triumphantly. 
Tomorrow evening. 
They stared avidly from Harry to Professor Umbridge, who had raised her eyes and was staring at him without a trace of a fake smile on her face. 
He could feel himself shaking. 
He kicked his chair aside, strode around Ron and Hermione and up to the teacher's desk. 
'I said, leave me ALONE!' Harry shouted, running down the nearest flight of stairs, but Peeves merely slid down the banister on his back beside him. 
A door to his left flew open and Professor McGonagall emerged from her office looking grim and slightly harassed. 
'What on earth are you shouting about, Potter?' she snapped, as Peeves cackled gleefully and zoomed out of sight. 
'Why aren't you in class?' 
A dull pounding pain was developing over his right eye. 
There was still no light in Hagrid's cabin. 
Harry gazed into the flames, feeling drained and exhausted. 
'Yeah, look, they're coming round now,' said George. 
'Excellent,' said Fred happily, but the next second Hermione had snatched both his clipboard and the paper bag of Fainting Fancies from his hands. 
'No,' she said, her voice quivering with anger, 'but I will write to your mother.' 
Fred and George looked thunderstruck. 
She wrenched her bag open; Harry thought she was about to put her books away, but instead she pulled out two misshapen woolly objects, placed them carefully on a table by the fireplace, covered them with a few screwedup bits of parchment and a broken quill and stood back to admire the effect. 
He thought of the long essay on giant wars and the pain stabbed at him sharply. 
He passed Seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormitories, but did not look at him. 
Hermione yawned widely and poured herself some coffee. 
Seems the houseelves do want freedom after all.' 
And in the meantime, I'm afraid, we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice!' 
She was the only person not given homework; everybody else was told to practise the spell overnight, ready for a fresh attempt on their snails the following afternoon. 
By the time they reached Care of Magical Creatures in the afternoon, Harry's head was aching again. 
Who can tell me what these things are called?' 
'Where's Hagrid?' he asked her, while everyone else was choosing Bowtruckles. 
Malfoy walked away, smirking over his shoulder at Harry, who felt suddenly sick. 
'I'll tell you what now,' she said, marching straight up to him and poking him hard in the chest with her finger. 
'Didn't I tell you I wanted to do a tryout with the whole team, and find someone who fitted in with everyone ! 
'What do you reckon are the odds of Umbridge letting you off on Friday?' said Ron sceptically, as they sat down at the Gryffindor table. 
I'll offer to do two more detentions or something, I dunno…" He swallowed a mouthful of potato and added, 'I hope she doesn't keep me too long this evening. 
'Evening, Professor Umbridge,' Harry said stiffly. 
Her bulging eyes narrowed. 
So he told 'evil, nasty, attentionseeking stones', did he? 
Tut, tut, 1 don't seem to have made much of an impression yet,' she said, smiling. 
'HeyI forgotdid she let you off for Friday?' 
His homework situation, however, was now desperate, and when he returned to the Gryffindor common room he did not, though exhausted, go to bed, but opened his books and began Snape's moonstone essay. 
Harry's third detention passed in the same way as the previous two, except that after two hours the words '/ must not tell lies' did not fade from the back of Harrys hand, but remained scratched there, oozing droplets of blood. 
That ought to serve as a reminder to you, oughtn't it? 
'Yes, I think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evening's work.' 
'II thought I'd try out for Gryffindor Keeper now I've got a decent broom. 
Two things sustained Harry that day. 
He now had a distant view of the Gryffindor Quidditch team soaring up and down the pitch, while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three high goalposts, apparently awaiting their turn to Keep. 
Blood trickled down his wrist. 
She moved towards him, stretching out her short ringed fingers for his arm. 
He wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet, staring at her. 
'She's there,' said Fred, who was also swigging Butterbeer, and pointed to an armchair by the fire. 
I'm banking on him turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today, to be honest. 
And do me a favour and help Ron as much as you can, OK?' 
'Oh, Harry, it's you… good about Ron, isn't it?' she said blearily. 
When Harry had (inished, she said slowly 'You're worried YouKnowWho's controlling her like he controlled Quirrell?' 
'Well,' said Harry, dropping his voice, 'it's a possibility, isn't it?' 
Wondering vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether they wanted to be or not, Harry uncorked his ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of his parchment, thinking hard… but after a minute or so he found himself staring into the empty grate, at a complete loss for what to say. 
He sat quite motionless for a while, gazing into the fireplace,: then, finally coming to a decision, he dipped his quill into the ink bottle once more and set it resolutely on the parchment. 
I'm writing because that thing I wrote to you about last summer happened again last night when I was doing a detention with Umbridge. 
Considering it was a very short letter, it had taken a long time to write; sunlight had crept halfway across the room while he had been working on it and he could now hear distant sounds of movement from the dormitories above. 
There you are,' he said, spotting her somewhere near the very top of the vaulted ceiling. 
She blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to mean that she understood. 
'Hey, has Gryffindor got a new Keeper yet?' she asked. 
Cho looked up, the parcel only halfattached to the owl's legs. 
Who cared about a stupid flying horse; Cho thought he had been really brave. 
Filch opened his mouth furiously, mouthed for a few seconds, then raked Harrys robes with his eyes. 
He stopped with his hand on the handle and looked back at Harry. 
Harry and Cho looked at each other. 
Thanks,' Harry said. 
'I wonder why he thought you were, then?' she said as she carried the owl to the window. 
'Erm… Quidditch later,' said Harry happily, pulling a large platter of bacon and eggs towards him. 
So I can, you know, get my eye in a bit.' 
Ron was staring up at the high windows, looking slightly preoccupied. 
Podmore was arrested by Ministry of Magic watchwizard Eric Munch, who found him attempting to force his way through a topsecurity door at one o'clock in the morning. 
Podmore, who refused to speak in his own defence, was convicted on both charges and sentenced to six months in Azkaban. 
'Sturgis was supposed to come and see us off, remember?' 
Nothing flew out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around the Owlery tower. 
Ron, who had pelted towards the ground to catch the Quaffle before it landed, pulled out of the dive untidily, so that he slipped sideways on his broom, and returned to playing height, blushing. 
On his third attempt, Ron caught the Quaffle; perhaps out of relief he passed it on so enthusiastically that it soared straight through Katie's outstretched hands and hit her hard in the face. 
He accelerated, rolling and swerving in and out of the Chasers, the warm autumn air whipping his face, and the distant yells of the Slytherins so much meaningless roaring in his ears… but too soon, the whistle brought him to a halt again. 
She was ignoring the Slytherins, who had now set up a chant of 'Gryffindor are losers, Gryffindor are losers,' but there was a certain rigidity about her seat on the broom nevertheless. 
This time they had been flying for barely three minutes when Angelinas whistle sounded. 
'What now?' he said impatiently to Alicia, who was nearest. 
'She needs the hospital wing,' said Angelina. 
'Sheermight have swallowed a Blood Blisterpod by mistake' 'Well, there's no point continuing with no Beaters and a Chaser gone,' said Angelina glumly as Fred and George zoomed off towards the castle supporting Katie between them. 
'Well, it was only your first one,' she said consolingly, 'it's bound to take time to' 'Who said it was me who made it lousy?' snapped Ron. 
Look, you said it was lousy so 1 just' 'I'm going to get started on some homework,' said Ron angrily and stomped off to the staircase to the boys' dormitories and vanished from sight. 
By the evening, Harry felt as though somebody had been beating his brain against the inside of his skull. 
And so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became steadily darker. 
Thanks,' snarled Ron, scratching out the offending sentences. 
'Blimey, it is!' said Ron quietly, throwing down his quill and getting to his feet. 
'Open it!' said Hermione eagerly, and Harry nodded. 
But I want to give you more than congratulations, Ron, I want to give you some advice, which is why I am sending this at night rather than by the usual morning post. 
Yes, I am sure you are surprised to hear thisno doubt you will say that Potter has always been Dumbledore's favourite — but I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be in charge at Hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very differentand probably more accurateview of Potter's behaviour. 
I am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over the summer. 
'Come on, we've got to get this finished sometime before dawn,' he said briskly to Harry, pulling Professor Sinistra's essay back towards him. 
Hermione was looking at Ron with an odd expression on her face. 
Nearly everyone in the wizarding world thought Sirius a dangerous murderer and a great Voldemort supporter and he had had to live with that knowledge for 
'1 was starting to think you'd go to bed before everyone else had disappeared,' he said. 
'Just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear.' 
'What about?' Ron began, but Hermione interrupted him.. 
'Does Lupin know her?' asked Harry quickly, remembering Umbridge's comments about dangerous halfbreeds during her first lesson. 
'Ah, well, that figures,' said Sirius. 
There was a tiny pop, and the place where Sirius's head had been was flickering flame once more. — CHAPTER FIFTEEN — The Hogwarts High Inquisitor They had expected to have to comb Hermione's Daily Prophet carefully next morning to find the article Percy had mentioned in his letter. 
"Dumbledore couldn't find anyone so the Minister put in Umbridge, and of course, she's been an immediate success —" 'She's been a WHAT?' said Harry loudly. 
"I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step towards ensuring that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose our confidence," said a Ministry insider last night. 
'(For a full account of Madam Marchbanks's alleged links to . subversive goblin groups, turn to page seventeen.)' 
Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two. 'So now we know how we ended up with Umbridge! 
Fudge passed this "Educational Decree" and forced her on us! 
But a grin was unfurling on Ron's face. 
'Umbridge won't know what's hit her.' 
'Even lower than a "D"? 
Professor Trelawney nodded curtly and, looking very disgruntled, turned her back on Professor Umbridge and continued to give out books. 
Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses. 
'But I disagree,' Hermione continued. 
'You disagree?' she repeated. 
'For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions,' said Professor Umbridge smoothly. 
'Are you telling me,' she said, lowering her voice so that the group of curious Ravenclaws behind them could not hear, 'that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor Umbridge's class again?' 
Professor McGonagall marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she knew Professor Umbridge was there. 
Got an owl from Dumbledore, would I like a couple of weeks' teaching work. 
Well… shall 1 get started then?' 
'Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do,' said Harry angrily. 
'Jolly good,' said Professor GrubblyPlank, and Professor Umbridge set off back across the lawn to the castle. 
'She's an awful woman,' said Hermione in a small voice. 
'Do what ourselves?' said Harry suspiciously, still floating his hand in the essence of Murtlap tentacles. 
'Isn't it obvious?' she said. 
'But…' Harry was grinning now, sure the pair of them were pulling his leg. 
He became aware that he was on his feet, though he couldn't remember standing up. 
Still breathing hard, he sank back into his chair, becoming aware as he did so that his hand was throbbing horribly again. 
Hermione stood up. 
She frowned at him, 'Oh, all right, the idea I had, thenabout you teaching us.' 
'I can have a penpal if I' 'He didn't only want to be your penpal,' said Ron accusingly. 
It doesn't seem fair if we don't offer the chance to other people.' 
What were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street towards them in Hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of Draco Malfoy? 
The trouble is,' she said to Harry, 'until VVoldemortoh, for heaven's sake, Roncomes out into the open, Sirius is going to have to stay hidden, isn't he? 
'I don't reckon he'd be stupid enough to turn up,' said Ron bracingly. 
She was quite right, of course, he was barely keeping up with his homework, though he was doing much better now that he was no longer spending every evening in detention with Umbridge. 
After breakfast they queued up in front of Filch, who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to visit the village. 
They walked down the main street past Zonko's Wizarding Joke Shop, where they were not surprised to see Fred, George and Lee Jordan, past the post office, from which owls issued at regular intervals, and turned up a sidestreet at the top of which stood a small inn. 
'I don't know about this, Hermione,' Harry muttered, as they crossed to the bar. 
I just don't think it's a good idea if we parade what we're doing.' 
Then he turned away and deposited Harry's money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it. 
I've always wanted to try Firewhisky' 
The door of the pub had opened. 
'Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,' said Hermione happily 'Ron, do you want to pull up some more chairs?' 
'I've told you, they just want to hear what you've got to say,' said Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly, 'you don't have to do anything yet, I'll speak to them first.' 
All of them, however, looked fixedly, even eagerly, at Harry. 
He thought Hermione should have seen this coming. 
His temper, always so close to the surface these days, was rising again. 
'She's not wrong,' mumbled Harry, and a couple of people laughed. 
The veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat. 
Hannah Abbott's eyes were as round as Galleons. 'And that's not to mention,' said Cho (Harry's eyes snapped across to her; she was looking at him, smiling; his stomach did another somersault) 'all the tasks he had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last yeargetting past dragons and merpeople and Acromantula and things…' 
He was trying to arrange his face so that he did not look too pleased with himself. 
'And nobody helped you get rid of those Dementors this summer,' said Susan Bones. 
I really don't think there's any point in meeting less than once a week' 'Hang on,' said Angelina, 'we need to make sure this doesn't clash with our Quidditch practice.' 
After all, Cornelius Fudge has got his own private army' 'What?' said Harry, completely thrown by this unexpected piece of information. 
Just because you're so narrowminded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you' 'Hem, hem,' said Ginny, in such a good imitation of Professor Umbridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed. 
'II think everybody should write their name down, just so we know who was here. 
In twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave, too. 
That Zacharias bloke's a wart,' said Ron, who was glowering after the figure of Smith, just discernible in the distance. 
'I don't like him much, either,' admitted Hermione, 'but he overheard me talking to Ernie and Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming, so what could I say? 
'Hmm… I could do with a new quill.' 
'Big surprise,' said Hermione under her breath. 
'So that's why she talks now?' he asked Hermione. 
Harry had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of Hogsmeade was. — CHAPTER SEVENTEEN — Educational Decree Number Twentyfour Harry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he had done all term. 
The happiness that had filled him since Saturday was gone. His insides were pulsing with rage. 
Hermione looked alarmed. 
'Don't worry, I'll behave myself…' 'Bet Umbridge is in History of Magic,' said Ron grimly, as they set off for Binns's lesson. 
'Yes… yes, hospital wing… well, off you go, then, Perkins…' Once outside the room, Harry returned Hedwig to his shoulder and hurried off up the corridor, pausing to think only when he was out of sight of Binns's door. 
As Harry approached, one of them croaked, 'You should be in class, Sonny Jim.' 
'Well then, why are you out of class?' 
'I' said Harry, but the flood of students rolling along the corridor was almost upon him. 
To GrubblyPlank,' said Harry. 
Well, it was pretty much automatic, 1 mean, she knows my father really well, he's always popping in and out of the Ministry… it'll be interesting to see whether Gryffindor are allowed to keep playing, won't it?' 
Harry leapt forward and seized the back of Neville's robes; Neville struggled frantically, his fists flailing, trying desperately to get at Malfoy who looked, for a moment, extremely shocked. 
He gestured towards the dim corner of the dungeon and Harry saw Professor Umbridge sitting there, clipboard on her knee. 
'And you have applied regularly for the Defence Against the Dark Arts post since you first joined the school, I believe?' 
Harry, however, thought he knew what was the matter. 
As Professor Trelawney flounced back to the highbacked teacher's chair, her magnified eyes full of angry tears, he leaned his head closer to Ron's and muttered, 'I think she's got the results of her inspection back.' 
'Certainly not! 
'I say nothing,' she choked, 'of sixteen years of devoted service… it has passed, apparently, unnoticed… but I shall not be insulted, no, I shall not!' 
And she spent the rest of the lesson striding among them, tears still leaking from behind her glasses, muttering what sounded like threats under her breath. '… may well choose to leave… the indignity of it… on probation… we shall see… how she dares…' 
'She obviously reckons Trelawney's an old fraud, too… looks like she's put her on probation.' 
'Good afternoon, class.' 
That's a bright side, is it?' snapped Harry, while Ron stared incredulously at Hermione. 
Harry slumped down into a chair, dragged his Potions essay reluctantly from his bag and set to work. 
Then he would force down the purple end of the chew, at which the vomiting would immediately cease. 
They're quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves and I can't find a rule that says the other idiots aren't entitled to buy them, not unless they're proven to be dangerous in some way and it doesn't look as though they are.' 
She, Harry and Ron watched George projectilevomit into the bucket, gulp down the rest of the chew and straighten up, beaming with his arms wide to protracted applause. 
They really know their stuff.' 
'Keeping an eye on you, of course.' 
'I'm still being followed?' asked Harry angrily. 
'Why was Dung hiding from us?' asked Ron, sounding disappointed. 
We lost Moody's spare Invisibility Cloak when Sturgis was arrested, so Dung's been dressing as a witch a lot lately… anyway… first of all, RonI've sworn to pass on a message from your mother.' 
'Never you mind, just stuff for the Order,' said Sirius. 
'And if we do get expelled?' Hermione asked, a quizzical look on her face. 
There's no other explanation.' 'You think Umbridge attacked Hedwig?' he said, outraged. 
'I've been suspecting this ever since Filch accused you of ordering Dungbombs, because it seemed such a stupid lie,' Hermione whispered. 
But then 1 thought, what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail? 
'Just thinking…' she said, still frowning at the rainwashed window. 
'No… not exactly…' said Hermione slowly. 
Harry and Ron looked at each other. 
'It would've been really annoying if you hadn't explained yourself properly.' 
'No, well, you wouldn't,' said Fred darkly, 'they're not in a place we generally display to the public.' 
She led her sodden and disgruntled team back into the changing rooms, insisting that the practice had not been a waste of time, though without any real conviction in her voice. 
Fred and George were looking particularly annoyed; both were bandylegged and winced with every movement. 
He pressed the towel to his face, his eyes screwed tight with pain. 
'What's up?' said several voices. 
'Was it your scar?' 
'But…' looking scared, Ron strode across to the window and stared out into the rain, 'hehe can't be near us now, can he?' 
'But… how do you know?' said Ron. 
Harry was thinking himself back. 
'C'mon… we've still got Silencing Charms to practise.' 
'Mimbulus mimbletonia,' said Ron's voice and Harry came back to his senses just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the common room. 
Thanks, Dobby!' said Harry, stroking Hedwig's head and blinking hard, trying to rid himself of the image of the door in his dream… it had been very vivid. 
'Dobby knows the perfect place, sir!' he said happily. 
'Because it is a room that a person can only enter,' said Dobby seriously, 'when they have real need of it. 
Sometimes it is there, and sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the seeker's needs. 
He was halfway out of his seat, intending to hurry upstairs for his Invisibility Cloak when, not for the first time, a voice very much like Hermione's whispered in his ear: reckless. 
The afternoons Care of Magical Creatures lesson was to be relocated from the stormswept grounds to a free classroom on the ground floor and, to their intense relief, Angelina had sought out her team at lunch to tell them that Quidditch practice was cancelled. 
Hermione's expression cleared. 
Fifthyears were allowed to be out in the corridors until nine o'clock, but all three of them kept looking around nervously as they made their way along the seventh floor. 
They hurried along the corridor to the place Dobby had described to Harry, a stretch of blank wall opposite an enormous tapestry depicting Barnabas the Barmy's foolish attempt to train trolls for the ballet. 
'OK,' said Harry quietly, while a motheaten troll paused in his relentless clubbing of the wouldbe ballet teacher to watch them. 
Ron was staring at it, looking slightly wary. 
These will be good when we're practising Stunning,' said Ron enthusiastically, prodding one of the cushions with his foot. 
'And just look at these books!' said Hermione excitedly, running a finger along the spines of the large leatherbound tomes. 
'What is this place?' 
'It would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity, don't you think?' 
'Yeah, the DA's good,' said Ginny. 
There was a good deal of appreciative murmuring and laughter at this. 
Everybody got to their feet at once and divided up. 
Something very odd was happening to Zacharias Smith. 
Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were doing the spell wrong. 
Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily, giving his partner time to get in under his guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around them; Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin FinchFletchley's wand spinning out of his hand, at other times merely causing his hair to stand on end. 
'OK, stop!' Harry shouted. 
'That was really, really good, Harry' said Hermione, when finally it was just her, Harry and Ron who were left. 
Hermione soon devised a very clever method of communicating the time and date of the next meeting to all the members in case they needed to change it at short notice, because it would look suspicious if people from different Houses were seen crossing the Great Hall to talk to each other too often. 
She gave each of the members of the DA a fake Galleon (Ron became very excited when he first saw the basket and was convinced she was actually giving out gold). 
The coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from the torches. 
The coins will grow hot when the date changes, so if you're carrying them in a pocket you'll be able to feel them. 
'WellI thought it was a good idea,' she said uncertainly, 'I mean, even if Umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets, there's nothing fishy about carrying a Galleon, is there? 
The fact that the Quidditch Cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the interest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game; the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the outcome, for they, of course, would be playing both teams over the coming year; and the Heads of House of the competing teams, though they attempted to disguise it under a decent pretence of sportsmanship, were determined to see their own side victorious. 
His greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence after he'd made a blunder; if he let in one goal he became flustered and was therefore likely to miss more. 
'Warrington's aim's so pathetic I'd be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me,' he retorted, which made Ron and Hermione laugh and wiped the smirk off Pansy Parkinsons face. 
'He's just nervous,' said Harry. 
'Good luck, Ron,' said Hermione, standing on tiptoe and kissing him on the cheek. 
Angelina had changed already and was talking to the rest of the team when they entered. 
But the scream of delight came from the Slytherins' end: Ron had dived wildly, his arms wide, and the Quaffle had soared between them straight through Ron's central hoop. 
Harry did not have to look to see what had happened: there was a terrible groan from the Gryffindor end, coupled with fresh screams and applause from the Slytherins. 
But twentynil was nothing, there was still time for Gryffindor to catch up or catch the Snitch. 
A few goals and they would be in the lead as usual, Harry assured himself, bobbing and weaving through the other players in pursuit of something shiny that turned out to be Montague's watchstrap. 
WEASLEY WILL MAKE SURE WE WIN But Harry had seen it at last: the tiny fluttering Golden Snitch was hovering feet from the ground at the Slytherin end of the pitch. 
A Bludger hit Harry squarely in the small of the back and he flew forwards off his broom. 
'It was that thug Crabbe,' said Angelina angrily, 'he whacked the Bludger at you the moment he saw you'd got the Snitchbut we won, Harry, we won!' 
'I've never seen a worse Keeper… but then he was born in a bin… did you like my lyrics, Potter?' Harry didn't answer. 
It seemed to have been her who had hit him with the Impediment Jinx; she was holding her whistle in one hand and a wand in the other; her broom lay abandoned several feet away. 
They had barely reached the door of Professor McGonagall's office when she came marching along the corridor behind them. 
'But instead of leaving it to Madam Hooch to sort out, you two decided to give an exhibition of Muggle duelling, did you?' bellowed Professor McGonagall. 
Blood rushed into Professor McGonagall's face. 
'What do you mean, help?' 
Cornelius just sent it… I mean,' she gave a false little laugh as she rummaged in her handbag, 'the Minister just sent it… ah yes…" She had pulled out a piece of parchment which she now unfurled, clearing her throat fussily before starting to read what it said. 
'Hem, hem… "Educational Decree Number Twentyfive".' 
Dreadful tempers… anyway, I was reading out our amendment… hem, hem … "the High Inquisitor will henceforth have supreme authority over all punishments, sanctions and removal of privileges pertaining to the students of Hogwarts, and the power to alter such punishments, sanctions and removals of privileges as may have been ordered by other staff members. 
'Walking,' Ron mumbled. 
Ron walked to the fireside and sank into the chair furthest from Harry's, not looking at him. 
This is all my fault' 'You didn't make me punch Malfoy,' said Harry angrily. 'if I wasn't so terrible at Quidditch' 'it's got nothing to do with that.' 'it was that song that wound me up' 'it would've wound anyone up.' 
'Well,' said Hermione, her voice trembling slightly. 'I can think of one thing that might cheer you both up.' 
He set off at a quick march, the other two jostling and bumping along behind him. 
Underneath was a raw, bloody, greentinged steak slightly larger than the average car tyre. 
'Oh, all righ',' Hagrid said in a resigned voice. 
'So,' said Harry, 'y°u saw them and then what?' 
'He was the biggest, the ugliest and the laziest. 
'Nah, he can get food all righ' fer himself,' said Hagrid. 
In any case, giants like Karkusoverload them with information and they'll kill yeh jus' to simplify things. 
Firs' we presented him with a nice battle helmetgoblinmade and indestructible, yeh knowan' then we sat down and we talked.' 
Yeh'd think, seein' as how their whole race is abou' finished, they'd lay off each other, bu'…' 
'Whose head?' gasped Hermione. 
Humanlookin' bones, some of them. 
'How did you get out of that?' asked Harry. 
'Death Eaters?' said Harry quickly. 
'Me and Olympe talked it over and we agreed, jus' because the Gurg looked like favourin' YouKnowWho didn' mean all of them would. 
Dumbledore had told us before we wen' not ter tangle with them if we could avoid it, and the trouble was they knew we was around — 'spect Golgomath told them abou' us. 
Harry allowed him thirty seconds of reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly. 
'Didn't they attack you when they saw you?' asked Hermione. 
'Probably woulda done if they'd bin in any condition,' said Hagrid, 'but they was badly hurt, all three of them; Golgomath's lot had beaten them unconscious; they'd woken up and crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find. 
'Well that's not badare they going to come over here and 
'Golgomath's lot raided the caves. 
'So… so there aren't any giants coming?' said Ron, looking disappointed. 
'Nope,' said Hagrid, heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak and applied the cooler side to his face, 'but we did wha' we meant ter do, we gave them Dumbledore's message and some of them heard it and I spect some of them'll remember it. 
Hermione gasped; her mug slipped through her fingers and smashed on the floor; Fang yelped. 
Her eyes were sweeping the cabin. 
'I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, yes,' said Umbridge, now pacing around the cabin, taking in every tiny detail within, from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned travelling cloak. 
'I sometimes say Fang's near enough human' There are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin,' said Umbridge sleekly. 
'Oh, 1… had a bit of an accident,' he said lamely. 
You left no address. 
Harry could almost hear his brain working furiously. 
'Oh, yes,' said Umbridge softly, looking back at him with her hand on the door handle. 
'I've bin keepin' a couple of creatures saved fer yer OWL year; you wait, they're somethin' really special.' 
'But tha's not very interestin', Hermione,' said Hagrid. 
The stuff I've got's much more impressive. 
Thought we'd go and see these creatures in their natural habitat. Now, what we're studyin' today is pretty rare, 1 reckon I'm probably the on'y person in Britain who's managed ter train them.' 
The Slytherins murmured agreement and a few Gryffindors looked as though they thought Malfoy had a fair point, too. 
'Mind yer own business!' said Hagrid, angrily. 
It surveyed the class for a few seconds, swishing its long black tail, then bowed its head and began to tear flesh from the dead cow with its pointed fangs. 
They're supposed to bring all sorts of horrible misfortune on people who see them. 
'Oh, yeah,' said Hagrid brightly. 
'Yeah, I was gonna tell yeh how come we got a herd. 
'No… because… well… it sounds… like grunting a lot of the time Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard. 
Well, once they're tamed, like this lot, yeh'll never be lost again. 
'Who did you see die?' she asked, her tone indifferent. 
She held up ten stubby little fingers, then, her smile wider and more toadlike than ever before beneath her green hat, she bustled from their midst, leaving Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson in fits of laughter, Hermione actually shaking with fury and Neville looking confused and upset. 
It's her thing about halfbreeds all over againshe's trying to make out Hagrid's some kind of dimwitted troll, just because he had a giantess for a motherand oh, it's not fair, that really wasn't a bad lesson at allI mean, all right, if it had been BlastEnded Skrewts again, but Thestrals are finein fact, for Hagrid, they're really good!' 
'Ignore them, just ignore them,' intoned Hermione, pulling out her wand and performing the charm to produce hot air again, so that she could melt them an easier path through the untouched snow between them and the greenhouses. 
Harry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last DA meeting before the holidays and was very glad he had, because when the torches burst into flame he saw that Dobby had taken it upon himself to decorate the place for Christmas. 
Harry saw Cho laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in his stomach, as though he had missed a step going downstairs. 'we can practise in pairs,' said Harry. 
They all divided up obediently; Harry partnered Neville as usual. 
After ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx, they laid out cushions all over the floor and started practising Stunning again. 
Feeling cheerful, he collected up the cushions with Ron and Hermione and stacked them neatly away. 
She was simply standing there, crying silently. 
'I'msorry,' she said thickly. 'I suppose… it's just… learning all this stuff… it just makes me… 
'He did know this stuff,' Harry said heavily. 
Thanks,' said Harry awkwardly. 
'I really like you, Harry.' 
In truth, he didn't know whether he was all right or not. 
Harry didn't quite know how to set about telling them, and still wasn't sure whether he wanted to. 
'Soerwhat did she want?' he asked in a mock casual voice. 
'Well?' Ron said finally, looking up at Harry. 
'Because she was crying,' Harry continued heavily. 
'Yeah,' said Harry, slightly desperately, 'who does?' 
'You just had to be nice to her,' said Hermione, looking up anxiously. 
'Well, 1 suppose it could have been worse,' she said. 
Of course, she would have been expecting him to ask her out after what had just happened… the thought made his stomach clench painfully. 
'Oh well,' said Hermione distantly, buried in her letter once more, 'you'll have plenty of opportunities to ask her.' 
Ron said nothing, but looked disgruntled. 
'Bit grouchy, yeah,' said Harry, whose thoughts were still on Cho. 
Harry dreamed he was back in the DA room. 
He was gliding between shining metal bars, across dark, cold stone… he was flat against the floor, sliding along on his belly… it was dark, yet he could see objects around him shimmering in strange, vibrant colours… he was turning his head… at first glance the corridor was empty… but no… a man was sitting on the floor ahead, his chin drooping on to his chest, his outline gleaming in the dark… Harry put out his tongue… he tasted the man's scent on the air… he was alive but drowsy… sitting in front of a door at the end of the corridor… chapter1821uncheckedhp1. jpg Harry longed to bite the man… but he must master the impulse… he had more important work to do… But the man was stirring… a silver Cloak fell from his legs as he jumped to his feet; and Harry saw his vibrant, blurred outline towering above him, saw a wand withdrawn from a belt… he had no choice… he reared high from the floor and struck once, twice, three times, plunging his fangs deeply into the man's flesh, feeling his ribs splinter beneath his jaws, feeling the warm gush of blood… The man was yelling in pain… then he fell silent… he slumped backwards against the wall… blood was splattering on to the floor… His forehead hurt terribly… it was aching fit to burst… 'Harry! 
He had to tell Ron, it was very important that he tell him… taking great gulps of air, Harry pushed himself up in bed, willing himself not to throw up again, the pain halfblinding him. 'Your dad,' he panted, his chest heaving. 
'Your dad's… been attacked…' 'What?' said Ron uncomprehendingly. 
'It wasn't a dream… not an ordinary dream… I was there, I saw it… I did it…' He could hear Seamus and Dean muttering but did not care. 
'I'm fine!' Harry choked, wiping his mouth on his pyjamas and shaking uncontrollably. 
Where does it hurt?' 
'No!' said Harry angrily; would none of them understand? 
The three of them stepped on to the moving stairs; the wall closed behind them with a thud and they were moving upwards in tight circles until they reached the highly polished oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin. 
'Well… I don't know,' said Harry, rather angrilywhat did it matter? 
Dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function Harry had never known, carried it over to his desk, sat down facing them again and tapped it gently with the tip of his wand. 
Dumbledore watched the smoke closely, his brow furrowed. 
Harry wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for, but before he could do so, there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right; the wizard called Everard had reappeared in his portrait, panting slightly. 
'Minerva, I need you to go and wake the other Weasley children.' 
Mrs Weasley was probably asleep, not watching the clock. 
'Arthur Weasley, injured, wife and children and Harry Potter coming to stay,' repeated Phineas in a bored voice. 
'He says he'll be delighted,' said a bored voice behind Dumbledore; the wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of his Slytherin banner. 
'Come here, then,' Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys. 
'What's going on?' he said, stretching out a hand to help Ginny up. 
The twins and Ginny were staring at him. 
Kreacher's footsteps had stopped on the stairs outside. 
'I had aa kind ofvision And he told them all that he had seen, though he altered the story so that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked, rather than from behind the snake's own eyes. 
When Harry had finished, Fred, George and Ginny continued to stare at him for a moment. 
I will send news as soon as I can. 
Sirius suggested once, without any real conviction, that they all go to bed, but the Weasleys' looks of disgust were answer enough. 
'Breakfast!' said Sirius loudly and joyfully, jumping to his feet. 
'It must have been the aftermath of the vision, that's all,' said Sirius. 
'You were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and' 'It wasn't that,' said Harry, shaking his head, 'it was like something rose up inside me, like there's a snake inside me.' 
'You need to sleep,' said Sirius firmly. 
There isn't any Seer blood in your family, is there?' she enquired curiously, as they sat side by side on a train rattling towards the heart of the city. 
Nowhere in Diagon Alley was big enough and we couldn't have it underground like the Ministrywouldn't be healthy. 
In the end they managed to get hold of a building up here. 
Theory was, sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the crowd.' 
The room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside, for many of the patients were making very peculiar noises: a sweatyfaced witch in the centre of the front row, who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the Daily Prophet, kept letting off a highpitched whistle as steam came pouring out of her mouth; a grubbylooking warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved and, with each clang, his head vibrated horribly so that he had to seize himself by the ears to hold it steady. 
Nah, they're Healers.' 
'Over here!' called Mrs Weasley above the renewed clanging of the warlock in the corner, and they followed her to the queue in front of a plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked Enquiries. 
'It's theseouchshoes my brother gave meowthey're eating myOUCHfeetlook at them, there must be some kind ofAARGHjinx on them and I can'tAAAAARGHget them off.' He hopped from one foot to the other as though dancing on hot coals. 
Next!' 
Next!' 
A harassedlooking wizard was holding his small daughter tightly by the ankle while she flapped around his head using the immensely large, feathery wings that had sprouted right out through the back of her romper suit. 
'Next!' 
'Why can't they take them off, Dad?' asked Fred. 
'Is it in the Prophet, you being attacked?' asked Fred, indicating the newspaper Mr Weasley had cast aside. 
The thing YouKnowWho's after?' 
'Anyway,' said Mr Weasley, in a raised voice, 'this time Willy's been caught selling biting doorknobs to Muggles and I don't think he'll be able to worm his way out of it because, according to this article, two Muggles have lost fingers and are now in St Mungo's for emergency bone regrowth and memory modification. 
You saw it the night he returned, didn't you?' 
'You can come and say goodbye afterwards. 
'Fine,' he said coolly, rummaging in his pockets, 'be like that. 
Harry hesitated to take one. 
Grinning in spite of himself, Harry took the end of the string and inserted it into his ear as the twins had done. 
It just seems to have vanished after it attacked you, Arthur… but YouKnowWho can't have expected a snake to get in, can he?' 
Harry remembered how the snakelike face of Voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of Professor Quirrell's head and ran his hand over the back of his own, wondering what it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of his skull. 
He felt dirty, contaminated, as though he were carrying some deadly germ, unworthy to sit on the Underground train back from the hospital with innocent, clean people whose minds and bodies were free of the taint of Voldemort… he had not merely seen the snake, he had been the snake, he knew it now… A truly terrible thought then occurred to him, a memory bobbing to the surface of his mind, one that made his insides writhe and squirm like serpents. 
'You look ever so pale… are you sure you slept this morning? 
Harry ignored him. 
'What is it?' 
The empty canvas remained silent. 
When he heard Mrs Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime, he retreated further upstairs and ignored her. 
They want me to do well, they'll understand. 
When he entered the bedroom, he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting for them, sitting on Ron's bed. 
Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose, even though Dumbledore told her Mr Weasley was in St Mungo's and he'd given you all permission to visit. 
'Well, you have!' she said. 
Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him. 
'I'm sorry' Harry said, and he meant it. 
'You had flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year.' 
'I was inside that snake. 
The tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers; magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets; a great Christmas tree, obtained by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies, blocked Sirius's family tree from view, and even the stuffed elfheads on the hall wall wore Father Christmas hats and beards. 
'Looks like a gibbon with two black eyes.' 
'It's Harry!' said George, pointing at the back of the picture, 'says so on the back!' 
Thanks for the book, Harry' she said happily. 
'No, no, houseelves can't leave unless they're given clothes. 
Sirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment, then said, Til look for him later, I expect I'll find him upstairs crying his eyes out over my mother's old bloomers or something. Of course, he might have crawled into the airing cupboard and died… but 1 mustn't get my hopes up.' 
'You're the third I've seen today… Spell Damage, fourth floor.' 
They told me they wouldn't need doing until tomorrow.' 
Typical Dad,' said Ginny, shaking her head as they set off up the corridor. 
'Now, how many autographs would you like? 
Shall we say a round dozen, you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be left out!' 
Gilderoy told the Healer with another glittering smile. 
Gilderoy does seem to be getting back some sense of himself; and we've seen a real improvement in Mr Bode, he seems to be regaining the power of speech very well, though he isn't speaking any language we recognise yet. 
Neville speaks most highly of you.' 
'Erthanks,' said Harry, shaking hands. 
'And you two are clearly Weasleys,' Mrs Longbottom continued, proffering her hand regally to Ron and Ginny in turn. 
'Again?' said Mrs Longbottom, sounding slightly weary. 
The door closed behind them. 
In fact, if it hadn't been for the DA, Harry thought he might have begged Sirius to let him leave Hogwarts and remain in Grimmauld Place. 
'You haven't done anything, have you?' 
'I was supposed to see you alone, Potter,' said Snape, the familiar sneer curling his mouth, 'but Black' 'I'm his godfather,' said Sirius, louder than ever. 
An obscure branch of magic, but a highly useful one.' 
Defence against external penetration? 
If anybody asks, you are taking remedial Potions. 
Tell me, how is Lucius Malfoy these days? 
At the door he looked back. 
But he had no opportunity to do so, and, eyeing the ugly look on Sirius's face, Harry wondered occasionally whether he would have dared to mention it even if he had the chance. 
'Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Voldemort,' said Hermione at once. 'Well, you won't be sorry not to have them any more, will you?' 
'A way of letting me know if Snape's giving you a hard time.r No, don't open it in here!' said Sirius, with a wary look at Mrs Weasley, who was trying to persuade the twins to wear handknitted mittens. 
A thin, pimply, jugeared youth in a purple uniform leapt down on to the pavement and said, 'Welcome to the' 'Yes, yes, we know, thank you,' said Tonks swiftly. 
'On, on, get on' And she shoved Harry forwards towards the steps, past the conductor, who goggled at Harry as he passed. 
Some of these appeared to have fallen over when the bus stopped abruptly in Grimmauld Place; a few witches and wizards were still getting to their feet, grumbling, and somebody's shopping bag had slid the length of the bus: an unpleasant mixture of frogspawn, cockroaches and custard creams was scattered all over the floor. 
That bossy woman up front 'oo got on with you, she's given us a little tip to move you up the queue. 
They could hear Stan ushering the unfortunate Madam Marsh out of the bus and the relieved murmurings of her fellow passengers on the second deck. 
Lupin and Tonks helped them off the bus with their luggage, then got off to say goodbye. 
'Have a good term, OK?' 'Look after yourselves,' said Lupin, shaking hands all round and reaching Harry last. 
Harry spent most of the next day dreading the evening. 
'Oh,' said Harry as his stomach leapt uncomfortably. 
'Had a good Christmas?' asked Cho. 
Harry sat down and so did Snape, his cold black eyes fixed unblinkingly upon Harry, dislike etched in every line of his face. 
The Dark Lord is highly skilled at Legilimency" 
The Dark Lord, for instance, almost always knows when somebody is lying to him. 
'It appears that the Dark Lord has been unaware of the connection between you and himself until very recently. 
'And Vol— herealised I was there?' 
When he withdrew it, some silvery substance came away, stretching from temple to wand like a thick gossamer strand, which broke as he pulled the wand away from it and fell gracefully into the Pensieve, where it swirled silverywhite, neither gas nor liquid. 
'And what are you going to do?' Harry asked, eyeing Snape's wand apprehensively. 
You will find that similar powers are needed for this… brace yourself, now. 
'My Aunt Marge,' Harry muttered, hating Snape. 
'Get up!' said Snape sharply. 
You are not trying, you are making no effort. 
Get ready, now! 
'What's in the Department of Mysteries?' 
We will continue work then.' 
As he opened it, he glanced back at Snape, who had his back to Harry and was scooping his own thoughts out of the Pensieve with the tip of his wand and replacing them carefully inside his own head. 
'Of course what?' said Ron rather impatiently. 
That is a bit odd…' 'So what's in the Department of Mysteries?' Harry asked Ron. 
Two Galleons each, watch Fred, now!' 
'Well, write it in your homework planner then!' said Hermione encouragingly. 
The happiness was draining out of him, but the laughter continued… He opened his eyes and, as he did so, he became aware that the wild laughter was coming out of his own mouth. 
Harry nodded without any conviction and slumped back on his pillows, aching all over from having fallen to the floor so often that evening, his scar still prickling painfully. 
MASS BREAKOUT FROM AZKABAN MINISTRY FEARS BLACK IS 'RALLYING POINT' FOR OLD DEATH EATERS 'Black?' said Harry loudly. 
We think it likely that these individuals, who include Black's cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, have rallied around Black as their leader. 
Hermione ripped open the newspaper and began to read the report inside while Harry looked around the Great Hall. 
It was a different story there: Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall were deep in conversation, both looking extremely grave. 
For once her pouchy toad's eyes were not sweeping the Great Hall looking for misbehaving students. 
It rings a bell…' 'We saw him,' Hermione whispered. 
We've seen it before… we could've stopped this from happening.' 
Harry was not thinking about Devil's Snare. 
There were relatives of their victims among the Hogwarts students, who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors: Susan Bones, whose uncle, aunt and cousins had all died at the hands of one of the ten, said miserably during Herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be Harry. 
In their confusion and fear, these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them: the one that Harry and Dumbledore had been expounding since the previous year. 
'Reckon they know anything new?' said Ron, gazing back over his shoulder at the three teachers. 
'If they do, we're not going to hear about it, are we?' said Harry angrily. 
For new notices had appeared on the house noticeboards the morning after news of the Azkaban breakout: ^ BY ORDER OF THE HIGH INQUISITOR OF HOGWARTS ^ Teachers are hereby banned from giving students any information •" that is not strictly related to the subjects they are paid to teach. 
Signed: Dolores jane Umbridge, High Inquisitor This latest Decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes among the students. 
Lee Jordan had pointed out to Umbridge that by the terms of the new rule she was not allowed to tell Fred and George off for playing Exploding Snap in the back of the class. 
'You try it some timeSnape trying to get inside your headit's not a bundle of laughs, you know!' 
'Remember the first time we played against each other, in the third year?' she asked him. 
We were on the same campsite. 
Harry could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to herno more difficult, in fact, than talking to Ron and Hermioneand he was just starting to feel confident and cheerful when a large gang of Slytherin girls passed them, including Pansy Parkinson. 
'Oh… I don't mind,' said Cho, shrugging. 
Tt's funny, isn't it,' said Cho in a low voice, gazing up at the pictures of the Death Eaters, 'remember when that Sirius Black escaped, and there were Dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him? 
The ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window he and Cho passed. 
It started to rain as they passed Scrivenshaft's; cold, heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry's face and the back of his neck. 
'Urn… do you want to get a coffee?' said Cho tentatively, as the rain began to fall more heavily. 
Well, she asked me to, so I thought I would. 
Harry, who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lunging movement across the table, could not think why she was telling him this. 
He could not believe she wanted to talk about Cedric now, while kissing couples surrounded them and a cherub floated over their heads. 
'But you won't talk to me! 
Pperhaps it would be best if we just… just ppaid and you went and met up with Hermione GGranger, like you obviously want to!' 
'1 don't know why you asked me out in the first place if you're going to make arrangements to meet other girls right after me… how many are you meeting after Hermione?' 
There was total silence within the teashop. 
It was raining hard now and she was nowhere to be seen. 
He turned right and broke into a splashy run, and within minutes he was turning into the doorway of the Three Broomsticks. 
Hagrid jumped and looked down at Harry as though he barely recognised him. 
Then Hagrid said abruptly, 'In the same boat, yeh and me, aren' we, 'Arry?' 
'And both orphans. 
He took a great swig from his tankard. 
'Yeah… I's'pose,' said Harry cautiously. 
'Whatever yeh say, blood's important…' And he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye. 
'I thought you were with Cho, I wasn't expecting you for another hour at least!' 
'Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived,' said Rita, taking a large slurp of her drink. 
Sucking on her cocktail onion, she gazed at Rita with her enormous, protuberant, slightly mad eyes. 
'He publishes important stories he thinks the public needs to know. 
'Probably, TwentyJive Ways to Mingle With Muggles and the dates of the next Bring and Fly Sale?' 
Of course, the Prophet might give you rather a lot for an insider's account of life in Azkaban.' 
'Ready to tell the public the truth?' 
He wondered how people would react to the story. 
But the breakout of Bellatrix Lestrange and her fellow Death Eaters had given Harry a burning desire to do something, whether or not it worked… 'Can't wait to see what Umbridge thinks of you going public,' said Dean, sounding awestruck at dinner on Monday night. 
Seamus was shovelling down large amounts of chicken and ham pie on Dean's other side, but Harry knew he was listening. 
He was rather pale, but went on in a low voice, 'It must have been… tough… talking about it… was it?' 
'You should have said it was really annoying, but I'd made you promise to come along to the Three Broomsticks, and you really didn't want to go, you'd much rather spend the whole day with her, but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please, please come along with you and hopefully you'd be able to get away more quickly. 
'Come on, Ginny's not bad,' said George fairly, sitting down next to Fred. 
'Hermione,' said Harry, shaking his head, 'you're good on feelings and stuff, but you just don't understand about Quidditch.' 
'Good catch,' Harry told Ginny back in the common room, where the atmosphere resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral. 
'It wasn't a very fast Snitch and Summerby's got a cold, he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong moment. 
Harry liked Angelina for the faith she was showing in Ron, but at the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the team. 
Fred and George wandered over. 
'Mind you… when he missed the fourteenth' 
Out of respect for his feelings, Harry waited a while before going up to the dormitory himself, so that Ron could pretend to be asleep if he wanted to. 
There, at the far end of the windowless passage, was a plain, black door. 
I expect all these,' she waved a hand at the assembled owls still scrabbling around on the table in front of Harry, 'are letters from readers.' 
'How you dare… how you could…' She took a deep breath. 
Meanwhile, Professor Umbridge was stalking the school, stopping students at random and demanding that they turn out their books and pockets: Harry knew she was looking for copies of The Quibbler, but the students were several steps ahead of her. 
He seemed to be trembling. 
He relinquished his grip on the chair and walked around it, closer to the man cowering on the floor, until he stood directly over him in the darkness, looking down from a far greater height than usual. 
'You have done well to tell me this,' said Harry. 
Send Avery to me.' 
His reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness… a face whiter than a skull… red eyes with slits for pupils… 'NOOOOOOOOO!' 
Ron took an unnecessarily large gulp of water; Harry saw it spill over his chin on to his chest. 
By 'they' he meant Dumbledore. 
1 think there must be defensive spells on it, or around it, to stop people touching it. 
He was recovering. 
Once he'd got his voice back, he'd explain what he'd been doing, wouldn't he? 
Of course, it would have been easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him. 
Sturgis had Moody's Invisibility Cloak, right? 
He had just been forced, yet again, to relive a stream of very early memories he had not even realised he still had, most of them concerning humiliations Dudley and his gang had inflicted upon him in primary school. 
'Perhaps,' said Snape, his dark, cold eyes narrowing slightly, 'perhaps you actually enjoy having these visions and dreams, Potter. 
'Yes, Potter,' he said, his eyes glinting. 
Now, if you are ready, we will start again.' 
'Well, Potter… that was certainly an improvement…' Panting slightly, Snape straightened the Pensieve in which he had again stored some of his thoughts before starting the lesson, almost as though he was checking they were still there. 
He was sure he had just broken into Snape's memories, that he had just seen scenes from Snape's childhood. 
I mean, I told you, I've dreamed about the door… but it's never opened before 'You are not working hard enough!' 
'Incapable though you are of predicting even tomorrow's weather, you must surely have realised that your pitiful performance during my inspections, and lack of any improvement, would make it inevitable that you would be sacked?' 
'It was your home,' said Professor Umbridge, and Harry was revolted to see the enjoyment stretching her toadlike face as she watched Professor Trelawney sink, sobbing uncontrollably, on to one of her trunks, 'until an hour ago, when the Minister for Magic countersigned your Order of Dismissal. 
That would be mine,' said a deep voice. 
'I'm afraid you do not understand the position. 
I shshallleave Hogwarts and'sseek my fortune elsewhere' 'No,' said Dumbledore sharply. 
'Either way, he's still got four legs,' said Hermione coolly. 
Aren't we going up to North Tower?' asked Ron, looking puzzled, as Parvati bypassed the marble staircase. 
Classroom eleven was on the ground floor along the corridor leading off the Entrance Hall from the opposite side to the Great Hall. 
'Erhi,' said Harry, shaking hands with the centaur, who surveyed him unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eyes but did not smile. 
'Professor Dumbledore has kindly arranged this classroom for us,' said Firenze, when everyone had settled down, 'in imitation of my natural habitat. 
'I didn'tI meantsorry' he finished in a hushed voice. 
She looked very offended, as did several of the people surrounding her. 
Mars, bringer of battle, shines brightly above us, suggesting that the fight must soon break out again. 
Harry and Ron were on the point of following them when Firenze called, 'Harry Potter, a word, please.' 
Then give him a warning from me. 
'Butwhat's Hagrid attempting to do?' said Harry nervously. 
Firenze surveyed Harry impassively. 
But he must be brought to his senses. 
They had finally started work on Patronuses, which everybody had been very keen to practise, though, as Harry kept reminding them, producing a Patronus in the middle of a brightly lit classroom when they were not under threat was very different from producing it when confronted by something like a Dementor. 
'What are youWhat's wrong?' 
'Not that I'm aware of,' said Harry blandly. 
'Yes, yes, do,' said Fudge, nodding, and he glanced maliciously at Dumbledore as Umbridge left the room. 
There was a wait of several minutes, in which nobody looked at each other, then Harry heard the door open behind him. 
She said that if 1 proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor, sometimes known as the Room of Requirement, I would find out something to my advantage. 
Percy Weasley let out a hearty laugh. 
Fudge remained motionless in midbounce, his mouth hanging open. 
'But there was a meeting tonight!' said Umbridge furiously. 
And Potter was the leader, was he not, Potter organised it, Potterwhy are you shaking your head, girl?' 
A split second later Dumbledore was on his feet, his wand raised; Kingsley started forwards and Umbridge leapt back from Marietta, waving her hands in the air as though they had been burned. 
A sudden suspicion, connected to Kingsley's whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him, sprang into Harry's mind. 
'Would you like a written confession from me, Corneliusor will a statement before these witnesses suffice?' 
'No — Professor Dumbledore!' 
The bit about how he's been trying to build up an army against the Ministry, how he's been working to destabilise me?' 
I could break out, of coursebut what a waste of time, and frankly, I can think of a whole host of things I would rather be doing.' 
The man called Dawlish blinked rather foolishly. 
'He will not be singlehanded!' said Professor McGonagall loudly, plunging her hand inside her robes. 
Coughing in the dust, Harry saw a dark figure fall to the ground with a crash in front of him; there was a shriek and a thud and somebody cried, 'No!'; then there was the sound of breaking glass, frantically scuffling footsteps, a groan… and silence. 
The dust was clearing. 
Dumbledore released Harry, raised his hand and grasped the phoenix's long golden tail. 
As it swung closed behind them, Harry heard Phineas Nigellus's voice. 
'Dumbledore will be back before long,' said Ernie Macmillan confidently on the way back from Herbology, after listening intently to Harry's story. 
The Head's office has sealed itself against her.' 
'Afraid I'm going to have to dock a few points from Gryffindor and Hufflepuff,' he drawled. 
'New Head, new times … be good now, Potty… Weasel King…' Laughing heartily, he strode away with Crabbe and Goyle. 
In fact, the only glass that seemed unchanged was the emeraldfilled one of Slytherin. 
'Malfoy just docked us all about fifty points,' said Harry furiously, as they watched several more stones fly upwards from the Gryffindor hourglass. 
'Have you ever?' asked Hermione. 
'You mustn't!' whispered Hermione. 
'You filthy little beasts would never have dropped Stink Pellets if you'd known I had it in my power to whip you raw, would you, now? 
'What?' said Harry, quite sure he had misheard her. 
'Now, Mr Potter, let us not play childish games. 
'Haven't got a clue.' 
'I could have got rid of the sparklers myself, of course, but I wasn't sure whether or not I had the authority.' 
She offered him the breast even though it was off his schedule. 
"Daddy?" Ellie said from the back seat. 
He had been saying "Ma" for almost a month now and had taken a stab or two at something that might have been "Daaa" or only wishful thinking on Louis's part. 
Eileen had fallen from the tire swing and hit a rock with her knee. 
The cut was shallow, but she was screaming like someone who had just lost a leg, Louis thought (a bit ungenerously). 
He capped the Mercurochrome and looked grimly at his daughter. 
Can't you do something?" 
"Got to get the stinger out," a voice behind them drawled. 
But the voice was so thick With Down East accent that for a moment Louis's tired, confused mind refused to translate the dialect: Got t'get the stinga out `n put some bakin soda on't. 
There was a sudden loud honk, a motor winding down, and then the big blue moving van was turninglumberinginto the driveway. 
"Looks like a path of some kind," Louis said. 
He fished it out and let the movers in. 
Crandall walked straight and easily, like a man of sixty instead of over eighty. Louis felt that first faint tug of affection. 
Rachel had prowled the house restlessly with Gage in her arms earlier, secondguessing the places where Louis had told. the movers to leave things, getting them to rearrange, change, or restack. 
"In a wheelchair?" 
"No ... but she walks very slowly, and her fingers .. 
Louis came back later feeling small. 
Louis shook his head. 
She's a good old girl, my Norma." 
"One hell of a big truck," Louis commented. 
I have to be getting back." 
"That path goes up into the woods about a mile and a half. 
"Know what's there?" 
There was a big old St. Bernard went rabid downstate a couple of years ago and killed four people. 
I spose he's over it now, but they never forget. When a good animal gets run down in the road, a kid never forgets." 
Louis's mind turned to Ellie as he had last seen her tonight, fast asleep with Church purring rustily on the foot of the mattress. 
"My daughter's got a cat," he said. 
"I'd get him fixed," Crandall said, crushing his smoke between his thumb and forefinger. 
I believe I'll go in for a slice of old Mr. Rat after all." 
Big day tomorrow." 
"Yeah, if you don't know where the pills are, I guess you'll have trouble." Crandall offered his hand and Louis shook it, mindful again of the fact that old bones pained easily. "Come on over any evening," he said. 
He felt the strain of the day beginning to pass. 
Louis was thinking about that when he slipped into sleep. 
Gage was beside him, and in the dream Gage was at least ten years old. 
His evening beer or two with Jud Crandall became something of a habit. 
He felt a nagging disappointment that there was nothing else he could do or suggest for her, but her Dr. Weybridge had things as under control as they were ever going to be for Norma Crandallbarring some sudden breakthrough, which was possible but not to be counted upon. 
Louis went over with a shopping bag and scolded Jud for not letting him help pick it. 
"Just let me put the baby to bed and then I'll listen to everything." 
"Yes!" Ellie said, getting up immediately. 
"It's gorgeous," Rachel breathed and then turned to Louis, almost accusingly. 
"This is a good walk for a little girl," Jud said kindly, "but I want you to promise your mom and dad that if you come up here, you'll always stay on the path." 
"I promise," Ellie said promptly "Why?" 
Louis hadn't held a compass in his hand since Boy Scouts, twenty years before, and his memories of how to find your way by things like the North Star or which side of the trees moss grew on were as vague as his memories of how to tie a sheepshank or a half hitch. 
They keep it nice. 
Jud called back cheerily over his shoulder: "Not much farther now... you bearin up, Louis?" 
Louis followed her while Rachel kept an eye on the baby. 
He had dug a bald place in the earth with the heel of his shoe and was carefully tapping all his ashes into it. 
Her mortal Illness had probably been long and painful and ugly, and Rachel would have been at an impressionable age. 
He supposed that explained how well the grass did; the sun could get through. 
He thought again that it was an odd thing for children to have kept up for so long. 
KILT ON THE HIGHWAY SEPT 15, 1968. in the same circle was a wide flat board planted deep in the earth. 
"Come here, Louis. Want to show you something." 
Bemused by the thought that here was a graveyard that went farther back than many graveyards for people, Louis walked toward the center and examined several of the markers. 
The grass had almost entirely overgrown one, and when he set it back up, there was a small tearing, protesting sound from the earth. 
Digging here ain't that easy, eitherground's awful stony, you know, hard to turn. 
And I helped them sometimes." 
"You see what I mean," Jud said, ruffling her hair. 
And if you was to step on the right one, they might all come down in an avalanche." 
It was nearly done, and be could almost imagine the liveried chauffeur, direct descendant of eighteenthand nineteenthcentury English coachmen, sitting imperially behind the wheel. 
There had been a boatsinbottles phase and a warmachines phase and even a phase in which he had built guns so realistic it was hard to believe they wouldn't fire when you pulled the triggerColts and Winchesters and Lugers, even a Buntline Special. 
She was wearing a dress, and it occurred to Louis that his daughter almost always put on a dress on Sundays, although they did not attend church. 
"What are you building?" 
"Look at this," he said, carefully banding her a hubcap. "See those linked R's? 
If we fly back to Shytown for Thanksgiving and we get on an L10l 1, you look Out at the jet engines and you'll see those same R's." 
"Michael Burns at school says all doctors are rich." 
"Well, you tell Michael Burns at school that lots of doctors get rich, but it takes twenty years.. and you don't get rich running a university infirmary. 
Elephants live a very long time, and there are some sea turtles so old that people really don't know how old they are ... or maybe they do, and they just can't believe it." 
And believe me, seventytwo years is a very long time." 
There are no guarantees, babe." "I don't want Church to be like all those dead pets!" she burst out, suddenly tearful and furious. 
Death was a vague idea; the Pet Sematary was real. 
"It's a really bad part!" 
Eventually her tears would stop. 
He put her up in her bed and then, came downstairs to the kitchen, where Rachel was beating cake batter too hard. 
She picked up the bowl again and began beating the cake batter even faster. "it's that damned place. 
He more than half suspected that one of the things which had kept their marriage together when it seemed as if each year brought the news that two or three of their friends' marriages had collapsed was their respect of the mysterythe halfgrasped but never spoken idea that maybe, when you got right down to the place where the cheese binds, there was no such thing as marriage, no such thing as union, that each soul stood alone and ultimately defied rationality. That was the mystery. And no matter how well you thought you knew your partner, you occasionally ran into blank walls or fell into pits. 
She stared at him angrily. 
"It's bad enough to try and cope with a deatha pet or a friend or a relativewhen it happens, without turning it into a... a goddam tourist attraction... a FFForest Lawn for aanimals..." 
"I feel like I fell through a hidden trapdoor and into a giant Mixmaster," he said, hoping for a smile. 
When something isn't going right, blame Rachel, right? 
It's perfectly natural. 
"You woke the baby up too. 
As he swept, he reflected on the last thing she had said and on the enormity of this difference of opinion, which had gone undiscovered for so long. 
Not for the first time Louis thought that the man had a peculiarand rather uncomfortableability to put his finger gently on whatever the sore spot was. 
On 15, goinghomeaftertheweekend traffic was fairly heavypeople recognized that every good latesummer weekend now might be the last one, Louis supposed. 
"Woolgathering. 
"It was just a mongrel, but he loved it well. 
Jud and Norma both laughed at this, and Louis grinned. 
She'll be too busy gettin to know her new friends this fall to worry much about that old place. 
"Doc," Jud said with great sincerity, "the day I get doubleskunked at cribbage would be the day I'd let a quack like you treat me." 
Territory is that which defines all else, hadn't he read that in some college history course? 
He's your uncle's best pal in the business. Oh, but Louis. Sweet little Ruthie... I can't stand to think she suffered. pray with me. will you, Louis? 
Louis got the telephone book, looked up a number, and jotted it on a blank memo sheet. 
"Wait until he's out of diapers," Louis said. 
He pointed the Honda Civic they had picked up as a second car toward the university and let it roll. 
And here he was, on his first real day of work, with the ambulance gone. 
She began to shake the thermometer down with brisk snaps. 
In the examining room the girl had given the impression of being someone who did not feel well at all but was trying not to let on. 
Now she was walking briskly, her hips swinging prettily, noticing and being noticed. 
Charlton dropped the thermometer into a sterilizer. 
A week or so before finals, she'll be convinced she has either mono or pneumonia. 
Louis began filling out the long Blue CrossBlue Shield forms, which amounted to a complete inventory of drug stock and medical equipment ("Every year," Steve Masterton said in an aggrieved voice. 
A shriek, as thin and sharp as a shard of broken glass, arose from the direction of Masterton's shout. 
Masterton was kneeling down, trying to hold the head of the boy sprawled on the floor. 
A moment later green drapes were jerked across the windows. 
Chariton and Steve Masterton moved instinctively between the boy or. the floor and the doors, cutting off the view as best they could. 
It was like looking through a broken window. 
He shifted his gaze to Charlton. 
We can't wait for EMMC to send out their own ambulance. 
If they have to, they can take him up to Bangor in one of the fire engines. 
Campus Security was here then. 
The eyes were vacant, notseeing, rimmed with blood: the mouth grinning the large grin of a dead carp. 
That was bad. 
Oh my God he called me by my name "Who are you?" Louis asked in a trembling, papery voice. 
After a moment the world began to clear again. 
The room is first conveniently cleared so the dying Sibyl can speak a few lines of oblique prophecy to me and me alone, and as soon as he's dead, everyone comes back. 
He broke off and said sharply, "Louis, are you all right?" 
One of the campus cops said, "Victor Pascow, according to the girl he was jogging with." 
There was no one in command here, no forward motion; the room was full of milling people. 
She was staring at Pascow's remains with a kind of hypnotized fascination. 
Now the girl sounded a little more steady. 
Louis pushed the hold button without picking up the receiver off its cradle. 
It's a bad way to start the semester." 
"And thanks. 
The pathologist probably tossed his brain into his chest cavity after taking a tissue sample and filled up the skull cavity with brown paper to prevent leakingsimpler than trying to fit the brain back into the skull like a jigsaw piece into a puzzle. 
Once under the trees, pine needles stuck to the soles of his feet... another little detail that was just a bit more real than it needed to be. 
The small branch of a dead tree poked his bicep rudely and he winced. 
This is happening. 
There were ugly sucking noises. 
They reached the clearing, and the moon sailed free of its reef of clouds again, bathing the graveyard with ghastly effulgence. 
His bloody lips were wrinkled back from his teeth, and his healthy roadcrew tan in the moon's bony light had become overlaid with the white of a corpse about to be sewn into its winding shroud. 
His eyes grew wide, and he crammed his knuckles against his mouth. 
Here the remains of a foot flexed its pallid joints. 
Pascow came closer and then spoke. "The door must not be opened," Pascow said. 
Still he pointed at the moving pile of bones. 
It is old and always restless. 
Sure, his drifting mind agreed. 
All a dream. 
Louis looked to his right. 
He glanced at his watch and saw it was nearly eight o'clock. 
His feet were filthy with dirt and pine needles. 
His eyes flew open again. 
The blankets were okay. 
The room looked normal now except for the stripped bed. He had gotten rid of the poison. 
Never turned a hair. 
It felt as if a long, invisible wire was being twirled through his head. 
When he got to the Medical Center, he called hello to Charlton and then ducked into the bathroom, believing that he must look like hell. 
"Then sing the chorus of `Instant Karma' or something." "May you both shine on," Hardu said, still smiling, and glided out the door. Louis and Steve Masterton looked after him for a moment, Silent, and then looked at each other. 
"Today's the day we put the welcome mat out for the dope pushers." 
"Nah, she was a redhead. 
At noon Louis walked up to the Bear's Den and got a tuna fish sandwich and a Coke. 
"Well, he was autopsied yesterday afternoon"that faint riffle of papers again"at around threetwenty by Dr. Rynzwyck. 
By then his father had made all the arrangements. 
He had experienced an isolated incident of sleepwalking, brought on by the unexpected and extremely upsetting happenstance of having a student mortally injured and then dying in his infirmary during his first real day on the job. 
Must have come back on autopilot. 
That he had been here was beyond doubt: the little grave marker put up to honor the memory of Smucky the Cat was knocked over. 
He surveyed the clearing again before leaving, struck by its green silence. 
Louis turned and headed home. 
"Just was," he said, turning out the lamp over his study desk and getting up. 
This caused a crying tantrum of such ferocity that Rachel and Louis stared at each other blankly, eyebrows raised. 
Church returned home on the Friday of Louis's first full week of work; Ellie made much of him, used part of her allowance to buy him a box of cat treats, and nearly slapped Gage once for trying to touch him. 
Looking at Church made Louis feel sad. 
There was no sign of Church's former feistiness. 
Perhaps it was ultimately for the better that he had changed. 
Louis had spoken to the tearful, mercifully faceless voice of Pascow's father on the telephone; the father had only wanted assurance that Louis had done everything he could, and Louis had assured him that everyone involved had. 
His one visit to a whore in Chicago six years ago seemed like that flow; they were equally unimportant, side trips which held a false resonance, like sounds produced in an echo chamber. 
He did not think at all about what the dying Pascow had or had not said. 
"Well, that's a real shame," Norma said, "but it will mean more to him next year. 
She took them back to the kitchen, and for a moment Jud and Louis were alone on the porch. 
I'm a little worried." 
Louis bent and put his hands on Ellie's shoulders. 
Carefullydon't get hit by a car. 
And Louis was suddenly doused with a cold, horrid certainty. 
There had been some pain in her eyes but not agony. 
Louis was breathing hard now and sweating. 
A good steady closedchest massage popped a lot of calories, and the webbing between his arms and shoulders would ache tomorrow. 
"Think I fainted." 
Her hand groped in the air, and Jud took it gently. 
Louis waved a hand, embarrassed. 
His brief moment of confusion and fear had passed. 
She smiled and waved back. 
"Is she going to be okay, Louis? 
When I wouldn't take the apple with the bruise on it?" 
He wanted to smile at himself and was not quite able. 
Another one and another one, until... boom! 
"But she's old, and she'll die pretty soon anyway. 
"No," he said, looking at her thoughtfully. 
She knows old people croak at regular intervals, just like she knows to let the grasshopper go when it spits like she knows that if you stumble on the number thirteen when you're skipping rope, your best friend will die ... like she knows that you put the graves in diminishing circles up in the Pet Sematary. 
The wind awoke Louis, and he started up on his elbows, mostly asleep and confused. 
"No," he breathed, and the steps died out. 
Louis shifted Gage, who looked gigantic and wideeyed in his first bigboy parka, to his other arm. 
She was clutching her three pink boarding cards in one hand. 
"Oh, you," she said and wrinkled her nose at him. 
He was also nervous. 
It would be a long time before he would admit to himself that part of his rage had been relief. 
In those days the Micmacs had been pretty fearsome, he said, and then added that he guessed there were a few state and federal land lawyers who thought they still were. It should have been a fine evening, but Louis was aware of the empty house waiting for him. 
He snared the phone. 
He could hear the wind whining around the corners of the house and the faint, husky mutter of the furnace. "Hello," he said. 
She would put Ellie on and Ellie would talk and then Gage would get on and Gage would babbleand how the hell had he managed to sleep all afternoon when he had meant to watch the football game... 
"I think it might be your daughter's." 
Then he went in and used the bathroom, put his shoes on, and went downstairs. 
As a doctor I know that... do you want to be the one to explain to her what happened if he gets run over in the road? 
There were two kinds of plastic bags in theresmall white ones for the household trash baskets and big green garbagecan liners. 
It was a feeling of aloneness that made him shudder. 
Standing on his frozen lawn, he looked like a piece of statuary, just another dead thing in this twilight landscape where no bird sang. 
"Where's Norma?" he asked, still not looking down at the sprawled bundle of fur by Jud's foot. 
Church's eyes were halfopen, as glazed as green marbles. 
"I'll be damned if I know how I'm going to tell Ellie about it." 
"Yes, I guess she loves it pretty well," Jud said. 
He raised his face into the wind after the door had clicked closed, the garbage bag with Church's body in it riffling between his feet. Content. 
How long he stood like that he did not know, although it could not have been long in terms of seconds and minutes. 
Once they got into the woods, there was no snow to speak of. 
The shadows fell away and there was a feeling of space. 
You don't pick your times for feeling good, any more than you do for the other. 
And the place has something to do with it too, but you don't want to trust that. 
Poisoning their bodies and poisoning their way of thinking. This place can be like that, Louis, and don't you ever forget it. 
I hope to God I'm doing right. 
Don't hesitate and don't look down. 
It came to him with a strange but total surety that the deadfall could not harm him unless he allowed it to. 
It was a piece of utter assholery of course, like the stupid confidence of a man who believes it's safe to drive when totally shitfaced as long as he's wearing his St. Christopher's medallion. 
In places it seemed very wide, although the moving light revealed little clearly; it was mostly a feeling of space, a feeling that the trees had drawn back. 
He fell into a rhythm of walking and became almost hypnotized with it. 
They hadn't been there long before Louis's girl said that she wanted to go home, or at least to another place, because all her teeth (all the ones with fillings, anyway, and that was most of them) were aching. 
The air around the power station had made him feel nervous and too awake. 
The air's heavier... more electrical... or somethin." 
Evil men off to bury gold doubloons by the dark of the moon... and of course one of them would be tumbled into the pit on top of the chest, a bullet in his heart, because the pirates had believedor so the authors of these lurid tales solemnly attestedthat the dead comrade's ghost would remain there to guard the swag. 
He felt wild laughter bubble up inside and stifled it. 
That crazy sense of exhilaration persisted, and he suddenly wondered if maybe Rachel was trying to call him; if, back in the house, the phone was ringing and ringing, making its rational, prosaic sound. 
The sound carries, Jud had said. 
Now the thing out there seemed so close that Louis expected to see its shape at any moment, rising up on two legs, perhaps, blotting out the stars with some unthoughtof, immense and shaggy body. 
To Louis it seemed that every joint in his body had frozen solid and that he had somehow gained weight, so much weight that if he turned to run he would plunge down and out of sight in the swampy ground. 
His mouth was totally dry. 
He could smell aromatic fir, feel needles. 
He grabbed Louis's arm and helped him up the last step. "We're here," Jud said. 
Louis saw a number of shapes just under the gloom cast by the treestrees which were the oldest, tallest firs he had ever seen. 
The dark shapes were cairns of stones. 
"Micmacs sanded off the top of the hill here," Jud said. 
Why did you bring me here?" "Because you saved Norma's life," Jud said, and although he sounded sincereand Louis was positive he believed himself sincerehe had a sudden, overpowering sense that the man was lying... or that he was being lied to and then passing the lie on to Louis. 
The patter of the earth on the plastic was a depressing sound, and while he did not regret coming up here, that sense of exhilaration was fading, and he had begun to wish the adventure over. 
"Look, Jud, I'm pretty tired and" "It's Ellie's cat," Jud said, and his voice, although soft, was implacable. 
"Most of these have fallen over," he said to Jud, standing and brushing at the knees of his pants. 
"Jud" he began again, but Jud only grabbed the pick and walked off toward the steps. 
Wordlessly, Louis handed Jud his pick. 
"What they don't think is that maybe they should be questioning those feelings of doubt before they question their own hearts," Jud said, looking at him closely. 
"I think," Louis said slowly, "that you might be right." "And the things that are in a man's heartit don't do him much good to talk about those things, does it?" 
Another time it could be wrongwrong as hell." "Will you at least answer one question?" 
Jud said no more; only looked at him from his inscrutable old man's eyes. 
Louis ran, wincing at the aches that flared in his upper thighs and lower back, but by the time he had gotten into the warm kitchen, the phone had already rung six or seven times. 
You don't? 
He rehung the telephone, crossed to the sink, and filled it with hot water. 
There was some leftover meatloaf in the refrigerator. 
But tonight he had said that Spot died when he, Jud, was ten. 
He's said himself that he's noticed signs of increasing forgetfulnessgroping for names and addresses that used to come to him easily, sometimes getting up in the morning and having no memory of the chores he planned to do just the night before. 
At some point he slept without even being aware that he had gone over the edge; it must have been so, because as he slipped away, it seemed to him that he heard bare feet slowly climbing the stairs and that he thought, Let me alone, Pascow, let me alone, what's done is done and what's dead is deadand the steps faded away. 
Bright sunshine streamed in the bedroom's east windows. 
"Had a few beers. 
In his mind he suddenly heard Jud Crandall saying, The soil of a man's heart is stonier, Louis... a man grows what he can and he tends ft. 
He had discovered this as soon as he finished talking to Rachel and went into the bathroom to brush his teeth. 
Jud and Norma weren't there, but there was an envelope tacked to the porch door with his name written across the front of it. He took it down and opened the flap with his thumb. 
By the way, Louis, I wouldn't talk about what we did last night either, not around North Ludlow. 
He could recall climbing the deadfall and the odd, brighter quality of light in the bogthat and the way it had felt ten or twenty degrees warmer therebut all of it was like the conversation you had with the anesthetist just before he or she put you out like a light. and I'd guess most men tell their wives a smart of lies.. 
Wives and daughters as well, Louis thoughtbut it was eerie, the way Jud seemed almost to know what had transpired this morning, both on the telephone and in his own head. 
Slowly he refolded the note, which had been written on a sheet of lined paper like that in a schoolboy's Blue Horse tablet, and put it back into the envelope. 
Live weight, he thought with a kind of sick excitement. 
His furry sides felt somehow too slick, too thickin a word, loathsome. 
Perhaps he had, and Louis had just never noticed. 
He undressed, tossing all of his clothes in the laundry hamper although he had put them on fresh from the underwear out that morning. 
The cat he had carried up to Jud's old Micmac burying ground had been unconscious, not dead. 
Thank God he hadn't said anything to Ellie! 
She wouldn't ever have to know how close Church had come. 
Church stared at him a moment longerGod, his eyes were different, somehow they were differentand then leaped down from the toilet seat. He landed with none of the uncanny grace cats usually display. 
He hurried, tucking in his shirt quickly, stuffing a pair of shorts, a tshirt, and a towel into his zipper bag, and trotting down the stairs. 
He should have put the cat out, he knew that, but he didn't. At that particular moment he didn't think he could bring himself to touch it. Jud lit a cigarette with a wooden kitchen match, shook it out, and tossed the stub into a tin ashtray with a barely readable Jim Beam advertisement painted on its bottom. 
The cross on the roof tree was silhouetted black against the setting sun. Something to sell, she said, at the church sale the week before Christmas. 
She had recovered nicely from her heart attack, and on that evening less than ten weeks before a cerebral accident would kill her, he thought that she looked less haggard and actually younger. 
There was others around these parts that knew the Micmac burying ground was there, but it was Stanny B. I heard it from, and he knew about it from his father and his father before him. 
He drove a big wagon covered with rawhide strips like something out of a medicine show. 
It was a story they had to have, the same way I guess we have to have some of our Christian stories. 
"Saying the devil made them do it." "Sure. 
Next I know, the clock is chimin the halfhour, then one o'clock, and still no Stanny B. He's forgot all about me, that dumb Frenchman, I think to myself, and I'm gettin ready to take my clothes off again when these two pebbles whap off the window, damn near hard enough to break the glass. 
If my parents had been around on the road side of this house, Louis, I would have been a goner. 
I want to tell you, though, Louis, I was some sore and sprung the next day. 
I imagine he slept out in back of the livery that night, and as things turned out, my dog Spot outlived Stanny B. by two years. 
My dad worked on the railroad, and he would have been gone since six." 
There was a bunch of white stuff on the floorcurtains she'd been meaning to hang. 
It is the way an old wound looks after it's been healed five years and more." Louis nodded. 
"Shooting a man or an animal in the head isn't as surefire as it sounds, Jud. 
There are wouldbe suicides in vegetable wards or even walking around right as rain who didn't know that a bullet can strike the skull plate and travel right around it in a semicircle, exiting the other side without ever penetrating the brain. 
"I'm just a few beers ahead of my usual pace. 
And I set down across from him, and he talked to me like a man for the first time in my life with the smell of the honeysuckle coming across the road from what's your house now and the smell of the wild roses from our own house." 
How many times has this story been passed along, I wonder? 
"Your dad knew all about it." 
"Did you ask him why he didn't take you, Jud?" 
Now, you go ahead and tell me if I'm wrong, and we'll leave it." 
Lester took Linda Lavesque up there after her dog got run over in the road. 
There was a light switch somewhere, but he was damned if he could remember anymore just where it was. He felt his way along slowly, shuffling his feet, his head swimming, anticipating a painful crack on the knee or a toy that he would stumble over, frightening himself with its crash, perhaps falling over himself. Ellie's little Schwinn with its red training wheels. 
Somehow he sailed off course and ran into the wall. 
She smiled (a trifle wearily, Louis thought) and set him on his feet. 
"I've got chili on the stove." 
"Let's get your suitcases and blow this joint. 
1 put him out with a broom at night because I don't like to touch him. 
And speaking of breakfast, I skipped mine that morning. 
By the time they had driven the seventeen miles from the Bangor airport to their house in Ludlow, Gage had begun to show signs of fever and had fallen into an uncomfortable doze. Louis backed into the garage, and out of the corner of his eye he saw Church slink along one wall, tail up, strange eyes fixed on the car. 
After a long momentit seemed very long to Louisshe put Church down. 
The cat padded away toward the dining room without looking back. 
"Whatever that bad smell is, he'll lose it." 
"Well, if you want a second opinion," Louis snapped, "be my guest." 
"You were," Rachel began, "you were shuhshuhshouting" And then her mouth began to quiver and she put a hand up to her face. 
It doesn't hurt you." 
The cat's eyes were open and stupidly gleaming in the light from the hail. 
It's not a secret, goddammit! 
This was the first time he had actually held the cat since the day it had come back, almost a week ago. 
Maybe there was no bolthole. 
I'll pull out the hideabed downstairs." 
This time he was alone. 
"But he was close," she said. 
She had drowsed off again herself while he was still taking it. About an hour later, the choking spell began. 
In the morning, Gage's temperature was almost normal. 
He laughed until he was crying and cried until he was laughing again. 
Except that after gaining a lot of speed, the toboggan had wandered off course and struck one of the Civil War cannons. 
Only the boy riding on the shoulders of the tailender had escaped completely unscathed, When the toboggan hit the cannon, this fortunate soul flew over it and landed headfirst in a snowbank. 
The two of them sat side by side in the glow of lights from the tree, fussing the stuff together, Rachel in a pair of silk lounging pajamas, Louis in his robe. 
Later he saw Church try to settle down next to Rachel's leg, and Rachel also gave it a push and an impatient "Scat!" 
He didn't think Rachel was even aware she was doing it. 
"Spares," Louis said, smiling guiltily. "You better hope they're spares. 
"Louis, we can't affordyou can't afford" "Shhh," he said. 
When he opened the door communicating between the kitchen and garage, an eddy of cold air swirled around his ankles. 
Church strikes again, Louis thought a little sickly, and turned his headnot, however, before he had seen the bloody, gaping socket where the crow's eye had been. 
Louis made a threatening gesture at the cat with the shovel, and it was gone like black water. 
"He knows if you've been sleeping," she sang softly; a little smile curved up the corners of her lips. 
I was alive and then I was dead and now I'm alive again. 
Ellie's faith in Santa Claus was restoredtemporarily at leastby the footprints in the hearth. 
Louis went into his office to take the call. 
"It isn't one of the kids, is it?" he asked. 
"Not one of the kids. 
She died this morning. 
Louis's brow furrowed, and in spite of this terrible news he found it was Rachel his mind was going out to, seeking, trying to find. 
You're his friend. Well I am, Louis thought with a small touch of surprise. 
When Louis called Steve Masterton that afternoon and told him what was going on, Steve said that he wouldn't mind going out just that way. 
Then Jud's mouth began to work and he covered his eyes with one arm. 
Louis went to him and put an arm around him. 
Jud cried for ten minutes or so, and then the storm passed. 
Louis was aware that it was not uncommon for two old married people to go almost handinhand, a month, a week, even a day apart. 
He reminisced; a constant stream of warm memories and anecdotes, colorful and clear and sometimes arresting, flowed from him. 
Yes, he said, he would have her cosmeticized, but it was to be a lightly applied layer. 
He hung up, looked at Louis, and said, "Prettiest cemetery in the world is right there in Bangor, as far as I'm concerned. 
Crack yourself another beer, if you want, Louis. All of this is going to take awhile." Louis was about to refusehe was feeling a little tiddlywhen a grotesque image arose unbidden behind his eyes: Jud pulling Norma's corpse on a pagan litter through the woods. 
Either our souls and thoughts somehow survive the experience of dying or they don't. 
He had agreed with his Psychology I teacher that the lifeafterlife experiences reported in scholarly journals and then vulgarized in the popular press probably indicated a lastditch mental stand against the onrush of deaththe endlessly inventive human mind, staving off insanity to the very end by constructing a hallucination of immortality. 
It may be that it's different for different people. 
He kissed her twice, once on the lips and once on the nose. 
"There are no pictures of her in the house anymore." 
He reached for her and caught a shoulder, which was pulled away from him as soon as he touched it. 
It explained so much, and even things he had never connected before or only suspected vaguely suddenly came together in his mind, She had never attended a funeral with him, he realizednot even that of Al Locke, a fellow med student who had been killed when his motorcycle had collided with a city bus. 
Louis, we watched her degenerate day by day, and there was nothing anyone could do. 
She put her face in her hands. 
They can't help it, but that doesn't help the people in the situation." 
"Want me to show you the textbooks? 
The room always smelled of piss and her drugs she had bottles of some dope that smelled like Smith Brothers' Wild Cherry cough drops and that smell was always there... some nights I wake up... even now I wake up and I think I can smell Wild Cherry cough drops... and I think. if I'm not really awake ... 
"And sometimes she'd touch me with her ... her hands . her birdy hands ... and sometimes I'd almost scream and ask her not to, and once I spilled some of her soup on my arm when she touched my face and I burned myself and that time I did scream ... and I cried and I could see the smile in her eyes then, too. 
I was waitingfor it to be time to give her some more medicine because she was screaming. 
I do think she hated me. 
I was eight!" 
She started making a sound, a kind of, I don't knowgaaaaaalike that" In her distressed, total recall of that day she did a more than creditable imitation of the way her sister Zelda must have sounded, and Louis's mind Bashed to Victor Pascow. 
For a long moment there was silence in the room. 
That she had been able to remove as much as she had was well nigh incredibleit did not just speak of her courage; it clarioned it. 
And if I needed another reason to ... to really dislike your mother and father, I've got it now. 
Like a childthe child of eight she had been when this dirty, incredible thing had happenedshe reprimanded him, "Lou, it was Passover season" "I don't care if it was judgment trump," Louis said with a sudden low and hoarse savagery that caused her to pull back a little. 
"To get you a Valium." 
No one could talk Rachel out of this beliefnot her mother, her father, or Dr. Murray, who diagnosed a mild backsprain and then told Rachel brusquely (cruelly, someLouis, for instancewould have said) to stop behaving so badly. 
In the frightful aftermath of these dreams she often thought that the closet door would bang open and Zelda would lurch out, blue and twisted, her eyes rolled up to shiny whites, her black tongue puffing out through her lips, her hands hooked into claws to murder the murderer cowering in her bed with her hands jammed into the small of her back. 
My dad had missed his chance to expand into the suburbs, and the sales in the downtown store were off. 
It was as if Zelda's death was the signal for good times to come around again. 
And you won't be mad at me if I'm sick when they bury Norma?" "No, honey, I won't be mad." 
He paused and then took her hand. 
"If you think it won't... won't hurt her." 
"For manand womanis like the flowers in the valley, which bloom today and are tomorrow cast into the oven: the time of man is but a season; it cometh, and so it passeth away. 
"Will the pallbearers come forward?" he asked. 
Although there have been times all through history that have witnessed anarchy and chaos, the state of chaos and confusion that will be created by the Antichrist will be on an unprecedented scale. 
Today, materialism, and the various ideologies and movements that it gives birth to, are the primary components contributing to corruption in the world. 
The humanist views mentioned in the above quote have today actually taken on the aspects of a religion. 
Blind chance is the central premise employed in Darwinism for maintaining that life came about out of inanimate matter and developed by means of an evolutionary process. 
Yet on careful inspection, that socalled god is one with no power of reason at all, and thus the most unintelligent god imaginable. That "god" is unaware of even its own existence, as well of that of what it has brought into being. 
Therefore, Darwinism is the most illogical and superstitious religion in the history of the world. 
What we are dealing with here is an intensive propaganda campaign aimed at spreading the ideological system of the Antichrist in the time before the last days. 
There is actually only one true answer that can be given to a child with respect of all these questions. 
Some people, however, do not give their children the true answer to these questions. 
Someone who thinks that life is the result of chance and coincidence, even if he is not fully conscious in the early stages of his believing in it, comes to believe that matter is the only absolute existence. Here he has completed the first stage of his indoctrination. 
The child continues to receive intensive Social Darwinist indoctrination in the lyrics of the songs he listens to, the films he watches, in advertisements, videos, and even the computer games he plays, in short, in every sphere of his life. 
However, the morality of the Qur'an offers a life at total variance with this model. 
They give food, despite their love for it, to the poor and orphans and captives: "We feed you only out of desire for the Face of God. 
People are taught they are not responsible to anyone else 
According to the following verse in the Qur'an, "Did you suppose that We created you for amusement and that you would not return to Us?" 
(Qur'an, 23: 115), God clearly reveals the distorted outlook of these ignorant people. 
He always remains in selfcontrol and conscientious. 
Essentially, Darwinism is one enormous deception. 
Strict discipline is an inherent part of a fascist regime. 
The Prophet Muhammad's descriptions of the Antichrist in the hadiths strongly resemble the criminalsinner character that appears in the Qur'an. 
This is how God reveals the responsibility of preventing wickedness that falls on the shoulders of the believers: 
Would that there had been more people with a vestige of good among the generations of those who came before you, who forbade corruption in the earth, other than the few among them whom We saved. 
One of the most important traits of evildoers is the way they are misled by their own passions and individual desires, instead of by the morality of the Qur'an. 
(Qur'an, 91: 710) 
The Antichrist will appear at a time when religion is weakened and knowledge is insufficient.11 
When people kill one another. 
The Qur'an, however, warns people against turning to extremism and going beyond the normal bounds. 
Extremism turns man away from the Qur'an. 
He is not to oblige people to believe. 
While encouraging people to atheism and a morality that denies God, he also tells the lie that he wants only what is good: 
God, however, the Creator of all, has commanded people never to follow in the way of the Devil. 
We need merely to consider the state of moral decline and general havoc in the world today, to recognize the scale of it. Most are familiar with this degeneration and chaos, no matter what country, nation or race they come from. 
There is here another matter which is very important to keep in mind. 
In order to test people, and to make know and to educate the righteous, as well as to demonstrate the disbelief of the unbelievers, and for many other reasons, God has allowed the works of the Devil in this world, and therefore the Antichrist, as set within His preordained plan. 
…But then when a warner did come to them, it only increased their aversion, shown by their arrogance in the land and evil plotting. But evil plotting envelops only those who do it. 
One of the most dreadful aspects of terrorism is the fact that it is devoid of all moral values and recognizes no rules. 
Other groups that have come to notice, due to their acts of terrorism, include fanatical racists such as the Ku Klux Klan and neoNazi groups. 
Furthermore, people are charged with effecting that kind of behavior no matter what the religion, language, race or gender of the person they are dealing with. 
He is an outright enemy to you. 
The aim behind the preparation of this section is not to provide information about these terrorist organizations. 
Today, in the United States as a whole, there are a great many Ku Klux Klan churches, even if they happen to go by other names, and many racist organizations linked to that church's teachings. 
It is no secret that the basis of the Klan's teachings is that European whites are superior to all other races, and that the white race should never be polluted by those others. 
The claim that Darwin put forward to demonstrate his theory is extremely interesting in the point of view of revealing his ignorance and prejudice. 
I could show fight on natural selection having done and doing more for the progress of civilization than you seem inclined to admit. 
Looking to the world at no very distant date, what an endless number of the lower races will have been eliminated by the higher civilized races throughout the world.16 
The idea of the superiority of the white race constitutes the basis of the organization's ideology. 
[The] objective [of our religion] would be: The Survival, Expansion and Advancement of the White Race. 
We would be more correct in calling it a brand of Social Darwinism, the fundamental teaching of which is the future struggle against other races. 
Such a degree of hostility towards other races, and the lack of any compunction over the using of violence as a means, are all the result of the belief in the theory of evolution. 
We are.21 
We believe that without this aid the nonwhite races would very quickly shrink their own numbers. 
Yet those who maintain the superiority of one race, and believe that their characteristics make them superior to others, are ignoring one very important truth. 
We despise and abhor integration, interracial marriage and the flooding of this country with nonWhite hoards. 
Interracial marriage is a sin against our people. 
The National Alliance 
The organization was first founded in 1970 by Dr. William Pierce, a young professor of physics at Oregon State University, as the National Youth Alliance. 
Like all other racist groups, the National Alliance aims to defend the superiority of the white race under all circumstances. 
Ultimately, we must separate ourselves from the Blacks and other nonWhites and keep ourselves separate, no matter what it takes to accomplish this… Eventually we must hunt them down and get rid of them.24 
As we have seen, the use of religious principles in speeches by fascist and racist groups, and their efforts to portray themselves as people who live by the morality of religion, are nothing more than a sham tactic. 
The rest were made up of murders, assaults, vandalism of homes and businesses, etc. 
Following the 1993 Oklahoma bombing by Timothy McVeigh, attention turned to William Pierce's book Hunter, in which Pierce described the actions of a bomber who acted alone. 
What is interesting about that bombing is that Timothy McVeigh was both the member of a deviant cult as well as a neoNazi. 
After the attack, McVeigh was helped by another neoNazi, Terry Nichols. 
People are attacked solely because of their language, religion or race, and needlessly suffer all sorts of abuse. 
God is AllKnowing, AllAware. 
Furthermore, the ideology has a large number of followers throughout the world. 
Elsewhere in that same book appears the commandment: Hate your enemies with a whole heart, and if a man smite you on one cheek, SMASH him on the other!31 
It is impossible to speak of order, peace, stability, security, forgiveness or tolerance in any society in which people do not listen to the voice of their consciences, and are thus unable to distinguish between good and bad, and to use their will and judgment to act for good. 
Satanism is the belief that Humans are nothing more than higher animals—we have no special place in creation other than being lucky to have evolved and survived…35 
Another Satanist publication, The Church of Satan, describes how they believe that human beings are a kind of developed animal: 
The way Satanism shares so many parallels with Social Darwinism, which regards Western society as superior to others, has led to cooperation between it and a number of other racist and chauvinistic movements, especially fascism. 
The antiChristian strength of National Socialist Germany is part of the appeal to Satanists—the drama, the lighting, the choreography with which they moved millions of people.39 
One can recognize such perversion, immorality and savagery in any society that takes Satan as its guide. 
For Satanists, these things are inspired by the Devil himself, and must be adhered to. 
It is therefore his aim to fill the world with bloodshed. 
We need to bear in mind the Satanists' own views when considering the threat posed by it. 
That is because, refusing to listen to the voice of one's conscience, or to live by proper morality, therefore following one's own desires, is the same as obeying the commands of the Devil. 
In addition to these, however, every day in America are attacks perpetrated by unknown groups as well as mass suicide. 
One must never forget that it should come as no surprise that people who do not believe in God, have no fear of Him, and refuse to recognize true morality, engage in such acts of violence. 
That is because, they do not believe they will have to account for their deeds, nor that they will receive their just due in the Hereafter. 
Although they all have different ideological motives, all terrorist groups and people who support the use of violence, whether listed here or not, and whether they are aware of the fact or not, agree on one thing. 
As we have stressed right through this book, it is peoples' refusal to listen to the voice of their consciences that turns them in the direction of violence and savagery. They totally ignore the fact that they are responsible to God and that they will have to account for all their actions in the hereafter. 
The most effective means of turning such people away from violence and terrorism, therefore, is in addressing the ignorance that directs them down that road in the first place. 
As we have seen throughout the course of this book, Darwinism is the principle foundation of such ideologies. 
Today, in the world as a whole, the system of the Antichrist prevails, in other words, anarchy, strife and chaos are rife. 
Cruelty can never endure. 
So the last remnant of the people who did wrong was cut off. 
The Antichrist will also come to the same end. Of that there is no doubt. 
God reveals that He will forgive those who repent for their sins and turn towards that which is good. 
By contrast, materialism, which seeks to deny the fact of creation in the universe, is nothing but an unscientific fallacy. Once materialism is invalidated, all other theories based on this philosophy are rendered baseless. Foremost of them is Darwinism, that is, the theory of evolution. 
Today as we leave the twentieth century, we still face the biggest unsolved problem that we had when we entered the twentieth century: How did life originate on Earth?50 
A paleontologist from Harvard University, Stephen Jay Gould, explains this deadlock of the theory of evolution although he is an evolutionist himself: 
You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a twodimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a threedimensional perspective having depth. 
For many years, ten of thousands of engineers have tried to make a threedimensional TV, and reach the vision quality of the eye. 
The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. 
This is an even worse and unbelievable blindness than the Egyptians worshipping the Sun God Ra, totem worship in some parts of Africa, the people of Saba worshipping the Sun, the tribe of the Prophet Ibrahim worshipping idols they had made with their own hands or the people of the Prophet Musa worshipping the Golden Calf. 
Words cannot express just how astonishing it is that this spell should hold such a wide community in thrall, keep people from the truth, and not be broken for 150 years. It is understandable that one or a few people might believe in impossible scenarios and claims full of stupidity and illogicality. 
And when they threw, they cast a spell on the people's eyes and caused them to feel great fear of them. 
That spell is already rapidly beginning to be lifted from the shoulders of people all over the world. Many people who see the true face of the theory of evolution are wondering with amazement how it was that they were ever taken in by it.

AE 205 English through Public Speaking and Drama II (3+0+0) 3 
Students are not only to read the articles, but to develop an awareness about the differences in interpretation of the writers, as well as take into consideration when, under which conditions and for which purpose the articles were published. 
In this way they are prepared to become individuals who know how to read, think, feel, and express themselves effectively, not only throughout their university years but in "real" life after they graduate. 
AE 241 is a course which basically concentrates on developing students' selfknowledge and selfconfidence by enhancing their skills of expressing themselves in English, both in writing and orally.

And I blessed them, and they prospered and grew numerous. 
He went to our brothers and spoke to them falsely against me. 
And in me lay the Purpose of one Destiny, while the Purpose of the other was affixed within the stone Aldur had created. 
By evil sorcery, they passed the barrier of the sea I had caused to be and they came like thieves in the night to the city of Cthol Mishrak. 
I saw that Belgarath's sorcerous daughter should in time be my bride, and I rejoiced. 
And upon that day, the two Destinies would clash, with only one victor alive and one Destiny thenceforth. 
And thus have I assured that my Purpose shall be served and that the evil of Aldur and his brothers shall not destroy the world which I caused to be created. The Kingdoms of the West which have harkened unto the counsel and beguilements of wicked Gods and evil sorcerers will be brought unto the dust. 
Hear me, you peoples, and fear me. 
The mule was not a particularly loveable animal to begin with, and there was a subtle difference to his gait that imparted a lugubrious note to a bell hung about his neck. 
Every kingdom in the world conceals its intelligence activities in exactly the same way. 
They plodded along through a dreary, shadowless world toward the stark mountains looming on the horizon ahead. 
The little Imperial Princess could beusually when she wanted somethingabsolutely adorable. 
Once it passed the border, the caravan route climbed steeply up a narrow gorge beside a swiftly tumbling mountain stream. 
Let it lie," Belgarath growled. 
It's very excited about you, so don't pay too much attention to it if it starts making suggestions. 
He's just sort of unremarkable for the time being. 
There were shafts running back into the hillsides, and great, rootedout excavations. 
Belgarath," Silk objected with a note of anguish in his voice. 
Riva's fifteen hundred leagues west of here," Belgarath explained. 
"The sun won't get that far for several hours yet." 
"Nothing all that serious, actually, but they're still circulating that thing." 
"They've even gone so far as to offer a reward. " 
"What do you think?" he asked, striking a pose. 
Doesn't look at all like a weasel, does he?" Belgarath asked Garion. Silk gave him a disgusted look, but said nothing. 
He joined them without any greeting or hint of uncertainty as to his welcome and began talking immediately as if taking up a conversation again that had only recently been interrupted. 
He squinted curiously at Garion. 
I'd been up to my ears in an ale keg for a day or so, and I was far gone when they took me. 
Morindim are superstitious, and they thought I was possessed. 
He turned his donkey and trotted off. "Good luck," he threw back over his shoulder by way of farewell and then he disappeared into the blue shadows under the trees. 
Belgarath made a sour face. 
We knew that already." 
His warning was a great deal more urgent than that." 
If he really wanted to, he could probably find out everything that's happening in the world." 
Belgarath snorted. "He's never forgotten anything in his life." 
He looked around then, his eyes very alert. 
The entire settlement seemed to reflect an attitude of "good enough" that offended Garion, for some reason. 
An air of fearful wariness hung over the whole place, seasoned with a touch of defiant bellicosity. Silk jerked his head toward a large, low building with a crude painting of a cluster of grapes on a sign banging in the breeze by the double doors at the front. 
The Nadrak looked at the three of them with only a hint of curiosity, trying with some difficulty to focus his eyes. 
"We'll probably go back in a day or so. 
It's supposed to be the Alorns. 
That'll be twelve pennies." 
Don't mention it," Silk said sourly. 
As the afternoon wore on, more and more of the men in the tavern grew reeling drunk, and occasional fights broke outalthough the fights usually consisted of shoving matches, since few in the room were sober enough to aim a good blow. 
Their companion drank steadily and eventually laid his head down on his arms and began to snore. 
"We might be just a little out of place in the middle of an Angarak horde." 
THE FOREST OF Nadrak was unlike the Arendish forest lying far to the south. 
The differences were subtle, and it took Garion several days to put his finger on them. 
The ponds and streams abounded with fish, muskrat, otter, and beaver. 
The sun rose early and set late, dappling the dark forest floor with golden light. 
May your hunt be successful," Garion returned. 
"Side door," Belgarath said tersely as they dismounted in front of the tavern, and they led their horses around the building and tied them at the porch railing. 
I suppose that makes sense," Garion admitted, "but don't the trappers know that?" 
Of course they do." Why do they drink before they do business, then?" Silk shrugged. 
Garion leaned toward his grandfather. "What do they mean when they talk about markers?" he whispered. 
Without changing expression the woman spat upon him. 
"He owns her, that's all." 
Garion clenched his fists and half rose, his face mottled with anger, but Belgarath's hand closed firmly about his wrist. 
Unless you want to buy the woman, of course," Silk suggested lightly. 
Tashor wants to sell me. 
you're not serious," she snorted. 
Vella raised both hands up in the air, and her face took on a tragic expression. 
"Not a copper less than four." Two goldmarks," the trapper offered. Unbelievable!" she exclaimed, spreading both arms. 
"I'll consider your offer of three with intentions," Vella declared. 
She makes that decision. 
Seriously enough to chase us, at any rate." 
There's not much we can do about that now," Belgarath grunted. 
The undergrowth was scanty, and the tall, straight trunks of fir and pine rose like great columns toward the blue sky overhead. 
It seemed a bit closer than the first had been. They rode on for another quarter of an hour and then they suddenly heard a great babble of confusion to the rear. 
He stopped once, glanced back over his shoulder at them, and raised his muzzle to lift the deep, belltoned howl that summoned the other members of his pack to return to their interrupted hunt. 
The long journey in search of the Orb had established a sort of pattern in his mind, a sense of rightness and wrongness, and this trip felt wrong. 
They want to go look for gold, not admire scenery." 
For a second it looked as if he might escape; but as he reached the doorway, someone outside rapped him sharply across the forehead with a stout cudgel. 
He reeled back, suddenly rubberlegged and vacanteyed. 
I don't really think military life would agree with me, and it's wildly inappropriate for you to be joining an Angarak army just nowall things considered. 
Garion had asked. 
Garion sank gratefully to the springy turf beside Silk. 
The Mallorean looked a trifle less sure of himself "We answer only to 'Zakath," he asserted a bit defensively. 
He tossed the wineskin to the Mallorean, turned his horse and rode back to the end of his pack string. He dismounted and began rummaging through a canvas pack. 
His companions gaped at him, then reached for their weapons with cries of alarm, but it was too late. 
you have no idea how sorry I am about that," yarblek replied, fishing several cups out of the pack. 
We'll probably get sickthat's what usually happens. 
The forests had been cleared for a league or so in every direction from the capital by the simple expedient of setting fire to it, and the approach to the city passed through a wilderness of burned black snags and rankgrowing bramble thickets. The city gates were stout and smeared with tar. Surmounting them was a stone replica of the mask of Torak. 
Silk, however, seemed relaxed and confident as always, and his behavior and attitude grated at Garion's nerves, for some reason. 
But the other awareness was gone. The two Grolims passed, and yarblek spat contemptuously into the street. "Pigs," he muttered. 
Silk," yarblek said bluntly, "I know you're a spy, and I'm not going to discuss politics with you, so quit fishing for information." 
Why don't you mind your own business?" 
But this is my business, old friend." 
Where are we going?" Silk asked him, looking around at the shabby street. 
yarblek turned his horse abruptly and led them into another narrow, filthy alleyway. 
Leaving their mounts with one of his men, they went on down the alley, stepping carefully over piles of rotting garbage. Down there," yarblek told them, pointing at a short, rickety flight of wooden stairs leading down to a narrow doorway. "Once we get inside, keep your heads down. 
"When you arrest somebody, you put shackles on him. 
There was a stir near the front of the tavern, and two heavyshouldered Nadraks in black leather tunics and pointed helmets pushed their way through the door. 
We'll wait a bit," yarblek replied. 
Garion shifted uncomfortably on the bench. 
It was Belgarath. 
Send him in." Drosta's voice was muffled. 
Garion looked at the Nadrak King sharply. 
He's a thief, a swindler, and a spy. 
"Luckily, I found out very soon that Malloreans are a priggish race. 
I'm teaching him the business." 
How can a fat man move so cursed fast?" 
He's deceptive," Silk said shortly. 
We're staring the end of the world right in the face. 
There's just one problem with all of this, Drosta," Silk told the agitated monarch. 
There'll be Chereks with him, and they'll kill any Angarak on sight. 
I'm definitely unwelcome at the palace just now." 
"It makes moving around a lot easier." 
That won't really be necessary, Drosta. 
"I might try to maneuver my way around Taur Urgas and 'Zakath, but I'm not going to cross Torak." 
If he wakes up" The king of the Nadraks shuddered. 
That's too much to even wish for. 
He's a God. 
His expression became awed, and desperate hope dawned on his ugly face. 
"your Majesty," he stammered, bowing with profound respect. " 
It looks as if I'm forced to wish you good luck," Drosta said in a quiet voice. 
DO yOU THINK we can trust Drosta?" Garion asked Silk as they followed Belgarath along the garbagelittered alley behind the tavern. 
They're opening the gate," Silk said. 
They know we're out here somewhere," Belgarath said. 
I'll take care of it as soon as we get into the woods," Silk replied confidently. 
"I'll catch up." 
Silk shrugged. "I stretched a rope across the road, about chesthigh on a mounted man. 
Where are we headed?" Silk asked as they moved into a canter. 
There were ugly black stains running down the sides of the stone. 
Quite deliberately, he walked across the springy turf to the bloodstained altar; he stared at it, his eyes meticulously recording details without considering their implication. 
It sort of helps to look at it," Garion replied quite calmly, still staring at the altar and the bones. 
Maybe it's time somebody did something about it." 
"What have you been doingstopping at every tavern along the way?" 
"I saw her last week," he reported. 
Beldin grinned suddenly. "you might want to give some thought to running away." 
He's been under a strain, and his nerves aren't too good just now," Belgarath replied. 
Alorns aren't noted for restraint in such matters. 
We just talked with Drosta lek Thun, the Nadrak King, and he's so sure that the Murgos and the Malloreans are about to go to war with each other that he wants to ally himself with the west just to get clear of it. 
It went like this: 'Behold, the heart of the stone shall relent, and the beauty that was destroyed shall be restored, and the eye that is not shall be made whole again." 
"That's what makes it so difficult to understand sometimes. 
If I come up with anything, I'll let you know. 
Garion watched him until he was only a circling speck. 
If Anheg gets his fleet into the Sea of the East and starts sinking Mallorean troop ships, 'Zakath might decide to march north and come across the land bridge. 
Why go to all the trouble of saying things that nobody's able to understand?" Because it's necessary to say it. 
The Morindim aren't on anybody's side. 
They don't even live in the same world with us." 
The world is a pretty terrible place for a Morinda demonhaunted place. 
Vordai's a witch. 
As long as he doesn't make any mistakes, the demon is his absolute slave and has to do what he tells it to do. 
I hadn't really planned to. 
Silk set crude traps among the maze of rabbit runs twisting through the tall grass, and Garion roamed the foothills in search of certain tuberous roots and a peculiar smelling white flower. 
"That's better," he grunted when he had finished, "and there's enough left for the tattoos." 
We're not really going to tattoo ourselves, Garion," Belgarath told him with a pained look. "They take too long to heal. 
"Garion will be the quester," he said. 
The grating sound of horn against bone set Garion's teeth on edge. 
Whitebraids there is trying to make a name for himself. 
The whitebraided magician of the Weasel Clan sneered and also slid off his pony. Quickly he drew a similar symbol on the ground and stepped into its protection. 
That's it," Silk muttered to Garion. 
Atop a large, white boulder, twenty yards or so to the left of the two magicians, there was a shimmering disturbance in the air, somewhat like heatwaves rising from a red tile roof on a hot day. 
The second disturbance also began to gather shards of color into itself. As he stared, first at one, then at the other, Garion sawor imagined that he sawa shape beginning to emerge in the center of each. 
Garion had the peculiar feeling that there was something elsesomething quite different and perhaps even worsetrapped inside each apparition. Growling, the two devils advanced upon each other, but despite their apparent eagerness to fight, they seemed almost driven, whipped toward the struggle. 
It was as if there was a dreadful reluctance in them, and their grotesque faces jerked this way and that, each snarling first at his opponent and then at the magician who controlled him. 
The incantations which held the Devil Agrinja locked within the apparition he had created to bind it rippled endlessly from his tongue. 
But Horja was already stalking toward him, his great hoofs crushing the grass as, step by step, he moved toward his former master. 
The interior struggle rippled more intensely within the form of the monster, but gradually Belgarath's will mastered and solidified the shape. 
Get a drink of water and try riot to think about it." 
They reached the coastline a day or so later. 
Summer's nearly over up here," Belgarath noted, looking out at the boulders gradually emerging from the receding water in the murky twilight. 
He moved along blindly, probing the unseen path with numb feet. 
And then they were past the worst of it. 
Later, as they sat huddled together on the leeward side of the boulder, Garion looked out across the sullen black sea toward the low, forbidding coastline lying ahead. 
Only the Bearcult remained, and Grodeg pushed his advantage to the limit. 
you're going to have to do something, Islena," Merel said firmly one evening when the two were alone in the queen's private apartment. 
Count Brador, the Tolnedran ambassador, was definitely growing tiresome, Queen Layla decided. 
"I wonderhave you had the chance to think over the proposals I gave you at our last meeting?" 
"Whatever led us into such a tedious subject as that?" she added. 
Surely your Highness recalls," the count protested with just the slightest hint of annoyance. 
At that prearranged signal, two of her younger children burst into the room, arguing loudly. 
What will the dear count think of us?" 
Thus it was that he viewed the appearance of the mailskirted emissary of King Taur Urgas with thinly veiled irritation. 
The servant of the Serpent Queen returns the greetings of the right arm of the DragonGod of Angarak." 
The slave trade is no longer significant, and the scars left by the Alorn invasion disappeared centuries ago. 
His Majesty merely wishes your permission to move certain forces through your territory to pose the threat on Tolnedra's southern border. 
Good for them. 
In either case, Nyissa would be on the winning side. 
The chorus of eunuchs still knelt adoringly in the queen's presence, but they no longer sang her praises. 
But even in restless doze, her tongue flickered nervously. 
Her tongue flickered, and her eyes, flat as glass, looked at the mirror. 
She turned to look at him. 
An excellent poison, Issus," Sadi agreed. 
"That brings us to the reason I sent for you. 
Issus' single eye brightened, and he rubbed his hands together. 
She had spent her entire life in the background, often so unobtrusively that people did not even realize that she was present. 
"What a splendid child!" 
The emaciated man was known only by the peculiar name "Javelin." 
There's a bit of trouble in Arendia," Javelin noted. 
Oh, the Honeths have finally united behind one candidatea pompous, arrogant jackass who's offended just about everybody in Tol Honeth. 
yes, your Highness," Javelin replied urbanely, "I know." 
"Let's pin down everyone who might have any connections with the Bearcult. 
The door opened and a servant thrust his head into the room. 
The army she had gathered in Arendia and northern Tolnedra moved like a great sea in the foothills of Ulgoland. 
you never get enough, do you?" Barak asked him pointedly. 
Her hours seemed filled with tedium. 
Noble was probably not a good name for him, since he was a lazy horse. A great part of his placidity arose from the fact that his new owner was so tiny that she had virtually no weight. 
"It's an absolutely wonderful day for a ride," she exclamed enthusiastically. 
Ariana sighed. 
There with a low cry she knelt almost reverently, gathering the bushes in her arms as if embracing them. 
"Whatever is wrong, Adara?" she asked. 
"I didn't realize that they'd grow and spread this way." 
Ce'Nedra exclaimed, clapping her hands with a great show of girlish delight. 
your Majesty, please, " Brendig complained. 
There are a number of other Tolnedran gentlemen with him," Brendig replied. 
"Please send for him at once." 
Ce'Nedra had known General Varana since her earliest childhood. 
He was blessed with that wry, understated sense of humor so characteristic of the Anadilian family. Of all the noble houses of Tolnedra, the Borunes were most comfortable with the Anadiles. 
I hadn't heard about it." 
"Morin doesn't do anything unless my father tells him to," Ce'Nedra mused, once again lifting the curl to her lips. 
Well, I would. What's that old fox up to?" That's hardly respectful, child." 
He shrugged. "If anyone cares to listen. 
"These suggestions you might makeif you happened to be near a Tolnedran legion that seemed to need a bit of direction, is it at all possible that one of these suggestions might be 'forward march?' " 
I'm certain that Drasnian intelligence has briefed your Majesty on the realities of the situation. The five spies you have in the Imperial palace are thoroughly professional." 
What's your assessmentas an observer?" 
Varana studied the map. "If you're going to go down the River Mardu, you'll have to neutralize the Thullish capital," he said, pointing at T'hull Mardu. 
you know Anheg?" Rhodar asked the general. Varana nodded. "By reputation," he replied. 
If Thull Mardu is heavily defended, it will cost you a third of your army to take it," Varana continued. We're going to lure the garrison out," Rhodar told him. 
"Once we get to the top of the escarpment, the Mimbrate knights are going to move out and crush every city and town in the uplands, and my clansmen will strike down into the farming regions to burn every standing crop." 
Naturally," Brand agreed in his rumbling voice, "but a diversion from what? 
"If he loses too many men, Taur Urgas will have the upper hand." 
Ce'Nedra watched with secret delight as these two brilliant men began what was obviously going to be a firm friendship. 
"I'll leave you gentlemen to your entertainments," she told them. 
The Algars at the gate admitted them immediately, and one guard was sent to Lady Polgara's candlelit apartment to inform her of their arrival. 
At once, Lady Polgara," the shaking Algar said, bowing. 
Ce'Nedra swallowed hard. "I really would leave, if I were you," she advised her friends. 
An insult's got a certain rhythm and flow to it that you haven't quite picked up yet." 
you should have talked faster," he told Ce'Nedra. 
I wouldn't dwell on that, Master Beldin," Ce'Nedra advised. 
In the center column the legions of Tolnedra, standards raised, marched with paradeground perfection. 
The mutiny on the plains near Tol Vordue had given Ce'Nedra a large body of men, but no senior officers, and once the danger of surprise inspections was past, a certain laxity had set in. 
Flanking the Mimbrates marched the Sendarian militiamen in their homemade uniforms, and at the rear of the host, the creaking lines of King Fulrach's supply wagons stretched back to the horizon. 
She was trying, without much success, to explain her cause to him. 
your supply lines stretch all the way back across the mountains and then up through Arendia. 
And what will you do if something happens to him?" 
I took notes while we were coming down through Arendia," King Fulrach replied. 
That's our margin of safety. 
Near the center of the supplydump a number of large pavilions had been erected for the use of the leaders of the army and their supporting staff. 
Ships," Anheg corrected. 
A boat is something else." 
Durnik took the two seamen aside and began talking earnestly with them, drawing diagrams on the sandy riverbank with a stick. 
I think you can count on it." 
"We don't want to alarm Taur Urgas or 'Zakath sufficiently to make them commit their forces. 
It will be an easy campaign if all we have to deal with are King Gethell's Thulls. 
If the Murgos and the Malloreans intervene, we'll be in for a serious fight." 
She found Lammer and Detton, the two serfs who had joined her army on the outskirts of Vo Wacune, finishing their afternoon meal in front of a patched tent. 
Except for all the walking," Lammer added. 
His melody soared toward the azure sky like an unfettered lark. 
There's not much else you can do for him." 
I'm not going to take orders from a Sendarian teamster who's found an easy way to avoid fighting. 
It may come quicker than you'd expected if you don't get your gear out of my way. 
you'll try to break my head." 
Torasin, grinning broadly, nodded. "Some of your troops feel the need to bluster, your Majesty," he replied, "and the Sendarian wagoneers usually don't have the time to listen. 
Rundorig's Arendish background made his mind move rather slowly. His companion, however, was anything but slow. 
Doroon was a small, wiry young man with a protruding Adam's apple and slightly bulging eyes. 
The great black cliff reared itself above them like an enormous wave of rock, frozen and forever marking the boundary between east and west, and seemingly blocking any possibility of ever passing in either direction. 
Why are the pulleys at the bottom?" King Anheg demanded suspiciously. 
"you see, the counterweight off balances the" 
"As long as somebody I know and trust understands, that's all that's really important." 
Mayaserana had never met Queen Porenn, but the shared experience of motherhood made her feel very close to the reputedly exquisite little blonde on her far northern throne. 
Instruct me in the art of banishing care, Highness," Nerina replied, "for I am in sore need of such teaching. 
My heart is bowed beneath a burden of concern, and try though I might to control them, my thoughts, like unruly children, return ever to the dreadful peril of my absent lord and our dearest friend." 
"That title commands more respect from us than other, more recent embellishments." 
"Let us all be free and open with one another." 
In the end he began to laugh. "It is sort of Arendish, isn't it?" he asked rather whimsically. The old Baron of Vo Serin gave him a quick look, then he too began to chuckle. 
And wilt thou also swear fealty to my husband?" the queen asked. 
"I'd rather go off to war than climb that ladder four times a day." 
Behind the door lay a filthy room with only a bed for furniture. 
On the bed were two sets of clothing that smelled of tar and salt water, and sitting on the floor were two large tankards of lukewarm ale. 
How can they drink this?" Sadi demanded, sniffing at one of the tankards and wrinkling his nose. 
Issus shrugged. "Alorns have peculiar tastes. 
Sadi noted that there had been two men in a doorway across the street when he and Issus had been ejected and that the two did not move to follow. Once they entered the Drasnian enclave, Issus led the way rather quickly to the house of Droblek, the Drasnian port authority. 
"After that, we'll see. 
I'd almost have to make an accommodation with Taur Urgas at that point." 
I do, however, expect to be remembered for my assistance." you're trying to play it both ways, Sadi," Droblek accused him bluntly. 
Torvik and his huntsmen had moved quietly through the dark streets of Val Alorn for the entire night, gathering up the sleeping members of the Bearcult, marching them in groups to the harbor and then locking them in the holds of waiting ships. 
She was trying to save this idiot's life, and he kept shouting at her. 
Queen Porenn of Drasnia was in the nursery, ostensibly feeding her infant son. 
Javelin, the bonethin chief of Drasnian intelligence, was with her. 
Those ships are the key to our whole campaign, and if somebody on the other side starts putting a few things together, we might have to meet all of Angarak instead of just the Thulls." 
What did you have in mind?" 
Even Lady Polgara went up that way just this morning." Polgara could fly down if something went wrong," Rhodar said. 
They've been leveled out a bit so that the horses can go up, but they're still very steep." 
"Proper ladies don't show off so much leg." 
The fortifications which had been erected along the top of the escarpment were extensive and quite imposing. 
How was the climb?" Barak inquired. 
A bit of cold chicken?" Durnik offered solicitously, handing him a wellbrowned chicken leg. 
"Whole villages of them have been showing up for the past week or so. 
It's nothing all that serious," Durnik told him. 
you know" Ce'Nedra made a little gesture with her hand that was meant to look magical. 
Dispatches?" Rhodar groaned, hauling himself wearily to his feet. 
It looks as if they've been making preparations for something for years. 
"There's bound to be some rather hot fighting in this campaign sooner or later," he noted. 
They'd be perfect for spearheading any attacks, wouldn't they?" 
There aren't any crops standing for fifty leagues in any direction," Hettar reported back. 
It's something to do." 
He lived in dreadful isolation, without love, without companionship, without any feeling but constant anxiety and dread. 
I don't know, Ce'Nedra," Polgara answered quietly. 
"No one doesnot me, not Beldin, not my father, not even Aldur. 
Sit down, Ce'Nedra, and I'll try to explain." 
Every man, every woman, every child has two possible destinies. 
Torak will not only win me, but all of mankind as well. 
If it should happen, it may very well be that I'll be deliriously happy to be his chosen and belovedbut deep inside, I think that a part of me will be screaming and will continue to scream in horror down through all the endless centuries to the very end of days." 
The depredations of the raiders, their short, savage sieges of poorly fortified Thullish towns and villages, and the milewide swaths of fire that they cut through fields of ripe grain had finally swung the sluggish Thulls into poorly organized attempts at resistance. 
Though Ariana was perhaps more sedentary in her habits and was accustomed, as all Mimbrate ladies were, to waiting quite patiently while the men were out playing, Adara, Garion's Algar cousin, felt her confinement most keenly. 
Ariana usually found some excuse to watch Lelldorin for at least half of each day. 
"He's off with King Fulrach taking an inventory of the supply dumps." 
"Where did you ever find all the wood for them?" 
They went off that way." 
The guard pointed toward the south. 
Although it was scarcely midmorning, the sun was already a furnace, and shimmering heatwaves rippled the valley floor ahead, making the dusty, graygreen bushes seem to dance in the windless air. 
"Oh, quit feeling sorry for yourself," she chided him irritably. This was not going at all as she had expected. 
Hettar shook his head in disgust. "Water their horses," he curtly told one of his men, "and then we'll escort them back. 
Hettar!" Ce'Nedra screamed as the Murgo raised his bow. 
It was a sound she would remember with horror for the remainder of her life. Adara doubled sharply, her free hand clutching at the arrow buried low in her chest, but her plunging gallop did not falter nor change as she rode the Murgo down. 
We must convey our dear friend to the fortress and Lady Polgara's ministrations immediately, lest her life drain away." 
Quickly!" Polgara's face was somber, and her eyes as hard as flint when she emerged from Adara's sickroom late that afternoon. 
"you and I have something to discuss." 
Are you all right?" he asked sharply. I'm surprisingly wellconsidering the fact that I'm dying." 
Lest his displeasure, rip'ning in his breast, Should work thee woe, so with repentance thou Too late my faithful counsel shalt recall. 
The glad obedience, which I used to see Kindling in every eye, is smother'd now In discontent and gloom; each, pond'ring, weighs The changes which a future day may bring, And serves the childless king, because compell'd. 
Is it that Tantalus, whom Jove himself Drew to his council and his social board? 
Bound by hate, In secret they contrive their brother's death. 
A son alone Was wanting to complete my parent's bliss; Scarce was this wish fulfill'd, and young Orestes, The household's darling, with his sisters grew, When new misfortunes vex'd our ancient house. 
Yes, I myself am she; Iphigenia,I who speak to thee Am Atreus' grandchild, Agamemnon's child, And great Diana's consecrated priestess. THOAS. 
Perchance my glad return is near; and how If I, unmindful of her purposes, Had here attach'd myself against her will? 
Thou wouldst to me and mine new life impart. 
 Remember now, O king, thy noble words! My trust and candour wilt thou thus repay? Thou seem'dst, methought, prepar'd to hear the truth. 
And trust me, Thoas, in thy happiness I have a deeper insight than thyself. 
Did not Diana snatch me from the priest, Preferring my poor service to my death? THOAS. 'Tis not for us, on reason's shifting grounds, Lightly to guide and construe rites divine. 
Perform thy duty; I'll accomplish mine. 
How easy 'tis for me, whose heart is crush'd, Whose sense is deaden'd by a hand divine, Thus to renounce the beauteous light of day! 
Nor you, nor I, should view the light of day. 
But thou, Orestes, to the gods give thanks, That they have done so much through thee already. ORESTES. When they ordain a man to noble deeds, To shield from dire calamity his friends, Extend his empire, or protect its bounds, Or put to flight its ancient enemies, Let him be grateful! For to him a god Imparts the first, the sweetest joy of life. 
Me have they doom'd to be a slaughterer, To be an honour'd mother's murderer, And shamefully a deed of shame avenging. 
Far as their sound extends, they bear the fame Of deeds unparallel'd. 
Peace, my heart! And let us steer our course with prudent zeal Toward the star of hope which gleams upon us. ACT THE THIRD. SCENE I. IPHIGENIA. 
And while I here am priestess of Diana, None, be he who he may, dare touch your heads. 
But the incensed king, should I refuse Compliance with the rites himself enjoin'd, Will choose another virgin from my train As my successor. 
Thus the sons Of Tantalus, with barbarous hands, have sown Curse upon curse; and, as the shaken weed Scatters around a thousand poisonseeds, So they assassins ceaseless generate, Their children's children ruthless to destroy.Now tell the remnant of thy brother's tale, Which horror darkly hid from me before. 
Silently she leads Her brother to the spot where fell their sire; Where lurid bloodmarks, on the oftwash'd floor, With pallid streaks, anticipate revenge. 
 Thine inmost heart reveals it. I am she, Iphigenia,look on me, Orestes! ORESTES. 
Do not repulse me,the eternal spring, Whose crystal waters from Parnassus flow, Bounds not more gaily on from rock to rock, Down to the golden vale, than from my heart The waters of affection freely gush, And round me form a circling sea of bliss. 
Ye Gods, remove From his fix'd eye delusion, lest this hour Of highest bliss should make us trebly wretched! 
A captive thou, prepar'd for sacrifice, And findest here a sister in the priestess. 
Now may the sun behold Your final doom. 
For thou, Diana, lov'st thy gentle brother Beyond what earth and heaven can offer thee And dost, with quiet yearning, ever turn Thy virgin face to his eternal light. 
Dost thou not feel thy sister and thy friend, Who hold thee living in their firm embrace? Grasp us! we are not shadows. 
To the king I'll now relate All that has happen'd. 
My brother forcibly engross'd my heart; I listen'd only to his friend's advice; My soul rush'd eagerly to rescue them, And as the mariner with joy surveys The less'ning breakers of a desert isle, So Tauris lay behind me. 
Let us then hasten; guide me to the fane, That I may tread the sanctuary, and seize With sacred awe the object of our hopes. 
Doth some new obstacle oppose our bliss? 
I now await the messenger's return. PYLADES. 
The danger thickens; but let us be firm, Nor with incautious haste betray ourselves; Calmly await the messenger's return, And then stand fast, whatever his reply: For the appointment of such sacred rites Doth to the priestess, not the king belong. 
Shall the dire curse eternally endure? 
And have I vainly hop'd that, guarded here, Secluded from the fortunes of my race, I, with pure heart and hands, some future day Might cleanse the deep defilement of our house? 
Save me, and save your image in my soul! 
Now my forbearance in her breast allures Audacious wishes. 
I trembling kneel'd before the altar once. And solemnly the shade of early death Environ'd me. Aloft the knife was rais'd To pierce my bosom, throbbing with warm life; A dizzy horror overwhelm'd my soul; My eyes grew dim;I found myself in safety. 
Cease! nor thus seek to cloak the savage force Which triumphs o'er a woman's feebleness. 
THOAS. I more respect them than a brother's sword. IPHIGENIA. Uncertain ever is the chance of arms, No prudent warrior doth despise his foe; Nor yet defenceless 'gainst severity Hath nature left the weak; she gives him craft And wily cunning: artful he delays, Evades, eludes, and finally escapes. 
Such arms are justified by violence. THOAS. But circumspection countervails deceit. 
Thy countrymen; no doubt they have renew'd The pleasing picture of return. 
Must gentle woman quite forego her nature,Force against force employ,like Amazons, Usurp the sword from man, and bloodily Revenge oppression? 
Say, who is he that threatens us? 
Do not delay! our friends are putting forth Their final strength, and yielding step by step, Are slowly driven backward to the sea.A conference of princes find I here? 
Now answer me: how dost thou prove thyself The priestess' brother, Agamemnon's son? ORESTES. Behold the sword with which the hero slew The valiant Trojans. 
A whole race In imitation soon will consecrate Its monarch's noble action into law. 
Great is the number of the valiant men Who wait upon me; but I will myself, Although advanc'd in years, oppose the foe, And am prepar'd to try the chance of arms. 
And then this scar, which doth his eyebrow cleave, Redoubles my conviction. 
Oh, 'tis he!Shall I adduce the likeness to his sire, Or the deep rapture of my inmost heart, In further token of assurance, king? THOAS. E'en though thy words had banish'd every doubt, And I had curb'd the anger in my breast, Still must our arms decide. 
To Phoebus' sister we applied the words, And he referr'd to thee! 
Oh, may the gods To thee the merited reward impart Of all thy kindness and benignity! 
Oh, do not turn away, but give One kindly word of parting in return! 
'How do you feel, Matrona?' she inquired, bending over the bed. 
'God is merciful, Matrona; perhaps you will be better soon. Did you take the medicine I sent you?' 
Why take her to the hospital? 
'Take care, now,' she said to the old man as she went out, 'and give her the medicine without fail, as it is written down, and give her some tea to drink.' 
'Goodmorning!' he began, with a lazy smile; 'what are you doing here, if I may ask?' 
The man addressed as Mihailo Mihailitch looked into her eyes and smiled again. 
'She is too weak; impossible to move her.' 
'Give it up? 
As though it wasn't always delightful to meet you? 
That's no great harm either! 
'She particularly wishes and told me to beg you very urgently to be so good as to dine with her today. 
She is expecting a new guest whom she particularly wishes you to meet' 'Who is it?' 
'Yes; we will come, most certainly. 
Alexandra Pavlovna turned round and went home. Konstantin Diomiditch, too, walked homewards. 
I know you.' 
Bassistoff rushed after them. 
Darya Mihailovna went every summer to her country place with her children (she had three: a daughter of seventeen, Natalya, and two sons of nine and ten years old). She kept open house in the country, that is, she received men, especially unmarried ones; provincial ladies she could not endure. 
But such questions lead to nothing. 
For example, if he were told of any disaster, that a village had been struck by lightning, or that a mill had been carried away by floods, or that a peasant had cut his hand with an axe, he invariably asked with concentrated bitterness, 'And what's her name?' meaning, what is the name of the woman responsible for this calamity, for according to his convictions, a woman was the cause of every misfortune, if you only looked deep enough into the matter. 
'So, according to you, African Semenitch,' continued Darya Mihailovna, turning to Pigasov, 'all young ladies are affected?' 
'I say that young ladies, in generalof present company, of course, I say nothing.' 
'How did you do that?' 
In short, she's a capital woman, and her servant girls grow fat. 
'Do you know, African Semenitch,' began Darya Mihailovna, 'you cannot be so bitter against women for nothing. 
'She brought me into the world.' 
Konstantin Diomiditch took his seat at the piano, and played the etude very fairly well. 
Don't you know? 
'Well, "incurable I see you are, and that is all about it," answered Darya Mihailovna, slightly altering Griboyedov's line. 
'I'll tell you why. 
I crossed the Oka lately in a ferry boat with a gentleman. 
'Oh no, it's not necessary. 
That's another abomination of mine; these elevated points of view. 
'He speaks Russian so beautifully,' grumbled Pigasov, 'that he deserves a eulogy in French.' 
Mlle. Boncourt followed a little behind. 
'With whom?' 
'Are you in the government service?' she asked. 
There followed a brief pause. The general conversation was resumed. 
'Why does it seem so to you?' 
No doubt you must know better.' 
'It contains both facts and propositions founded upon the facts.' 
'How do you say that there are none then? 
Why do you believe in facts?' 
'He's by no means a fool,' every one was thinking. 
Doubtless they are not easy for every one to get at, and to make mistakes is natural to man. However, you will certainly agree with me that Newton, for example, discovered some at least of these fundamental laws? 
I beg your pardon,' she added with a cordial smile, 'what is your paternal name?' 
Scarcely a breath escaped Bassistoff; he sat the whole time with open mouth and round eyes and listenedlistened as he had never listened to any one in his lifewhile Natalya's face was suffused by a crimson flush, and her eyes, fastened unwaveringly on Rudin, were both dimmed and shining. 
'It's only a pity his hands are so big and red.' 
Make an effort, challenge him again,' and without waiting for him to answer, she beckoned to Rudin. 
'There's one thing more you don't know about him,' she said to him, with a gesture towards Pigasov,'he is a terrible hater of women, he is always attacking them; pray, show him the true path.' 
Rudin involuntarily looked down upon Pigasov; he was a head and shoulders taller. 
'There are things which it is a shame to laugh at and make fun of, African Semenitch!' said Bassistoff warmly, turning away from Pigasov. 
She got up; her face expressed her confusion. 
'Do you know Schubert's "Erlkonig"?' asked Rudin. 
Rudin only made a slight motion of the head and ran his hand through his hair, as though disposing himself to listen. 
Natalya was standing near the piano, directly facing Rudin. 
'I spent a year at Heidelberg, and nearly a year at Berlin.' 
There was a lack of colour in his descriptions. 
All listened to him with profound attention. 
Fools are more to my taste.' 
But Darya Mihailovna soon left off questioning him. She began to tell him about herself, her youth, and the people she had known. 
She spoke of them simply, without particular enthusiasm or admiration, as though they were her daily associates, calling some of them queer fellows. 
'The cross old gentleman who was here last night?' inquired Rudin. 
'What a genius you have for defining a man! 
"He judges the sound," as the saying is, "the sound by the sick." 
'I read his article.... _Entre nous ... cela a assez peu de fond!_' 'Who else have you here?' asked Rudin, after a pause. 
There are two or three neighbours besides, but they are really good for nothing. 
'A certain Lezhnyov, Mihailo Mihailitch, a landowner here.' 
I have been anxious to get him to come here; he is spoken of as clever; I have some business with him.... 
Rudin got up from his seat, but Darya Mihailovna stopped him. 
We are near neighbours, you know, and all but relations.' 
A short silence followed. 
'His is the same disease as Pigasov's,' observed Rudin, 'the desire of being original. 
A man puts on a mask of indifference and indolence so that some one will be sure to think. "Look at that man; what talents he has thrown away!" 
I will let you go till lunch time and I will go and look after my business. 
And Darya Mihailovna held out her hand to Rudin. 
Her feelings were strong and deep, but reserved; even as a child she seldom cried, and now she seldom even sighed and only grew slightly pale when anything distressed her. 
'You have nothing to hide from me,' Darya Mihailovna said to her once, 'or else you would be very reserved about it; you are rather a close little thing.' 
These novels Darya Mihailovna read herself. 
Rudin pronounced this last phrase rather strangely; either he envied Natalya or he was sorry for her. 
'All the summer and autumn, and perhaps the winter too. 
I am a very poor man, you know; my affairs are in confusion, and, besides, I am tired now of wandering from place to place. 
Who, if not you' 'I thank you for your flattering opinion,' Rudin interrupted her. 'To be useful ... it is easy to say!' 
'Even if I had any firm conviction, how could I be useful?even if I had faith in my own powers, where is one to find true, sympathetic souls?' 
'But no,' he said, suddenly tossing back his lionlike mane, 'that is all folly, and you are right. 
'Yes,' answered Natalya, 'we were just going home.' 
Rudin was not at his best; he did nothing but press Pandalevsky to play Beethoven. 
His heart was heavy. 
'Rudin's youth?' 
He was born in T, and was the son of a poor landowner, who died soon after. 
I went to see her when I was staying in T. 
I am convinced that all you have told me is true, that you have not made up anything, and yet in what an unfavourable light you have put it all! 
I don't know him. 
If he says "I," he stops in rapt admiration, "I, yes, I!" and the phrases he uses are all so drawnout; if you sneeze, he will begin at once to explain to you exactly why you sneezed and did not cough. 
Pandalevsky was a little afraid of Rudin, and cautiously tried to win his favour. 
Volintsev had got on to curious terms with him. 
Once he spent a whole morning with him, discussing the weightiest problems of life, and awakening his keenest enthusiasm, but afterwards he took no further notice of him. 
Rudin shook his head. 
Natalya was on the point of replying, but she checked herself. 
'What shall I do? 
At first, at the word 'love,' Mlle, Boncourt started, and pricked up her eyes like an old warhorse at the sound of the trumpet; but afterwards she had grown used to it, and now only pursed up her lips and took snuff at intervals. 
The question must be put in an altogether different way ... one must attack it more deeply.... 
Mlle, Boncourt gave him a sidelong look out of her little French eyes. 
On this same day Alexandra Pavlovna had a conversation with Lezhnyov about Rudin. 
At first he bore all her attacks in silence; but at last she succeeded in rousing him into talk. 'I see,' she said to him, 'you dislike Dmitri Nikolaitch, as you did before. 
I will not even quarrel with him for being a tyrant at heart, lazy, illinformed!' Alexandra Pavlovna clasped her hands. 
'What's bad, he isn't honest. 
Do you mean that he is a flirt?' 
I think you are mistaken. 
According to your ideas, Rudin is a kind of Tartuffe.' 
But I told a lie about it, and rather a shameful lie. It all came out, and I was put to open shame. 
'How can I tell you? 
'Not the least!' replied Alexandra Pavlovna slowly; 'why should you think so? 
But unluckily he has not altered. 
It's not every one who can say that of himself!' 
It was already the grey morning when we separated, moved, happy, aspiring and sober (there was no question of wine among us at such times) with a kind of sweet weariness in our souls ... and one even looked up at the stars with a kind of confidence, as though they had become nearer and more comprehensible. 
'Yes; I gave them up. This girl was a sweet, good creature, with clear, lively eyes and a ringing voice.' 
'You are such a severe critic,' retorted Lezhnyov. 
Two days after first meeting her I was wild over her, and on the seventh day I could hold out no longer, and confessed it in full to Rudin. 
I remember I used even to go about at that time with a kind of circumspection, as though I had a sacred chalice within me, full of a priceless liquid, which I was afraid of spilling over.... I was very happy, especially as I found favour in her eyes. 
Rudin did not cut me out; he did not even try to cut me out; but, all the same, he put an end to my happiness, though, looking at it in cool blood, I am ready to thank him for it now. 
I should hardly, even then, have married the young lady (I had so much sense still left), but, at least, we might have spent some months happily a _la Paul et Virginie_; but now came strained relations, misunderstandings of every kind. 
It ended by Rudin, one fine morning, arriving at the conviction that it was his sacred duty as a friend to acquaint the old father with everythingand he did so.' 
It had to be cut, but it was painful! However, everything in the world is ordered for the best. 
You will see, that girl will astonish us all.' 
She knew that he loved her. But her mind did not dwell on him more than an instant.... 
She felt a strange agitation. 
'I will go with you.' And he walked along beside her. 
'At your age you ought to find happiness in life.' 
'Do you rememberthe comparison you made yesterdaydo you rememberof the oak?' 
Let us rather talk of you.' 
'Can it be, Dmitri Nikolaitch,' Natalya interrupted him, 'you expect nothing from life?' 
Before her friendship with Rudin she would never have succeeded in uttering such a long and ardent speech. 
Listen: you know I am your friend; I take almost a brother's interest in you. 
Nonsense! he does not take his eyes off you, and follows every movement of yours; indeed, can love ever be concealed? 
'How is that?' asked Rudin. 
How am I to understand you?' 
'Only one word!' cried Rudin after her She stood still, but did not turn round. 
'This won't be the end of it,' both were thinking. 
Volintsev went to the very end of the garden. 
He, too, was disturbed; his thoughts were in a whirl. 
The trustful, unexpected contact of a young true heart is agitating for any one. 
Natalya, pale all over, could scarcely sit in her place and did not raise her eyes. 
It happened that Pigasov was dining at Darya Mihailovna's that day. He talked more than any one at table. 
Among other things he began to maintain that men, like dogs, can be divided into the shorttailed and the longtailed. 
And this is a fit subject for wonder; the tail, of course, is a perfectly useless part of the body, you admit; of what use can a tail be? but all judge of their abilities by their tail. 
Talk of despotism! ... 
Rudin left him in possession of the field. 
Then he turned to another gentleman who to begin with had been a freemason, then a hypochondriac, and then wanted to be a banker. 
'How were you a freemason, Philip Stepanitch?' Pigasov asked him. 
For God's sake, be on your guard. 
You saw I did not even answer him today.... 
'No, but it's time.' 
Very beautiful was her pale, noble, young face, transformed by passion, in the mysterious shadows of the arbour, in the faint light reflected from the evening sky. 
'I tell you then,' she said, 'I will be yours.' 
He straightened his tall figure, shook back his locks, and walked quickly into the garden, with a happy gesture of his hands. 
Volintsev was no more cheerful in the morning. 
Alexandra Pavlovna kept looking uneasily at her brother, but she did not worry him with questions. 
He was ill at ease, but tried to conceal his embarrassment. 
Volintsev continued to stare out of the window. 
His voice sounded choked. 
I have too profound an esteem for youthat is why I have come; I did not want ... we both did not wish to play a part before you. 
I want one thing; I want you not to regard me as treacherous or hypocritical, to understand me ... 
I am convinced of your discretion.' 
'What, aren't you well?' he asked, seating himself in a chair near the sofa. 
He had never before given Lezhnyov a hint of his sentiments towards Natalya, though he guessed they were no secret to him. 'Well, brother, you have surprised me!' 
Lezhnyov said, as soon as Volintsev had finished his story. 
It will be our last meeting, all will be over, unless ... 
The sun had already risen some time when Rudin reached the Avduhin pond, but it was not a bright morning. 
'Ah, supposing they've seen us!' cried Masha; 'indeed it's surprising how we got out of the house ... and ma'mselle may wake up... 
Natalya stopped. 
I must tell you that my mother knows everything. 
Oh, the heart of a girlit's pure gold! 
But did your mother really declare her decision so absolutely on the impossibility of our marriage?' 
Tell me, what are your plans?' 
'What is to be done? 
So this is how you translate your talk of independence, of sacrifice, which ...' Her voice broke down. 
But she did not listen to him. 
I am ashamed to speak of thisbut I see it is all over now.' 
Your peace is dearer to me than anything in the world, and I should have been the basest of men, if I could have taken advantage' 'Perhaps, perhaps,' interrupted Natalya, 'perhaps you are right; I don't know what I am saying. 
Sooner or later your mother would forgive usand then ... 
Remember all your words, Dmitri Nikolaitch. 
That was all I heard from you, that you, you, Rudin?No! goodbye.... 
She turned swiftly and ran towards Masha, who had begun to be uneasy and had been making signs to her a long while. 
Rudin bowed to him without speaking, and as though struck with a sudden thought, turned out of the road and walked quickly in the direction of Darya Mihailovna's house. 
'I thought you meant to drive home?' 
The friends began to drink tea. 
'No!' he cried, 'I cannot bear this any longer! 
Volintsev seized the letter, quickly tore it open, and began to read. 
This will certainly be a surprise to you, especially after what passed yesterday. 
Lezhnyov made no reply, but his eyes were smiling. 
It's just as well, I daresay, from one point of view; but his departure has prevented one surprising enterprise from being carried out that I had begun to talk to your brother about.' 
'Why, I proposed to your brother that we should go on our travels, to distract his mind, and take you with us. 
'You say so, Alexandra Pavlovna, because you don't know me. 
He got up, buttoned himself up, called a servant and told him to ask Darya Mihailovna if he could see her. 
Rudin knew that Darya Mihailovna was angry with him. 
'Granting he is clever, he is a genius!' she said, 'what does that prove? 
He sat down, but not like the old Rudin, almost master of the house, not even like an old friend, but like a guest, and not even a very intimate guest. 
'Yes,' replied Rudin drily. 
Darya Mihailovna cut him short. 
Natalya evidently avoided Rudin. 
He had a feeling of nausea at his heart. 
Natalya had gone to her own room, and there she read Rudin's letter. 
It is always so, but why am I writing to you? 
For this sin I am punished now. 
'Once before I loved a woman, and she loved me. 
My feeling for her was complex, like hers for me; but, as she was not simple herself, it was all the better for her. 
Truth was not told to me then, and now I did not recognise it when it was offered me.... 
'Nature has given me much. I know it, and I will not disguise it from you through false modesty, especially now at a moment so bitter, so humiliating for me.... 
'I confess, Natalya Alexyevna, I am very unhappy. 
Think sometimes of me. 
Natalya let Rudin's letter drop on to her lap, and sat a long time motionless, her eyes fixed on the ground. 
This letter proved to her clearer than all possible arguments that she had been right, when in the morning, at her parting with Rudin, she had involuntarily cried out that he did not love her! 
She sat perfectly still; it seemed as though waves of darkness without a ray of light had closed over her head, and she had gone down cold and dumb to the depths. 
Darya Mihailovna was secretly perplexed; for the first time it struck her that she did not really understand her daughter. 
Natalya looked at her mother. 
'He is gone, you see ... your hero. 
The next day Volintsev and his sister came to dinner. 
'What! 
'Nurse,' she began, 'I think it's time to put Misha to bed. 
'Look here, Sasha,' cried Lezhnyov, from the distance, to his wife, 'whom I am bringing you.' 
That was all nonsense, I suppose?' 
I forgot to tell you,' he continued, turning to Lezhnyov, 'that I have made the acquaintance of that Terlahov, with whom Rudin travelled abroad. 
Yes! Yes! What he told me of him, you cannot imagineit's simply screaming! 
As he was incessantly developing (these gentlemen always are developing; other people simply sleep and eat; but they manage their sleeping and eating in the intervals of development; isn't that it, Mr. Bassistoff?' Bassistoff made no reply.) 
He began to look about for a sweetheart worthy of such an astonishing conclusion. 
So they spent two hours. 
'Listen, African Semenitch!' began Lezhnyov, and his face assumed a serious expression, 'listen; you know, and my wife knows, that the last time I saw him I felt no special attachment for Rudin, and I even often blamed him. 
It is high time! 
He is not an actor, as I called him, nor a cheat, nor a scoundrel; he lives at other people's expense, not like a swindler, but like a child.... 
You cannot even have an ideal face without individual expression; only a vulgar face can be devoid of it. 
That is pleasanter than being unfair to him, and we have been unfair to him. 
'What do you think, will my brother be happy with Natalya?' 
He sat with bent head, the peak of his cap pulled over his eyes. 
His best days were clearly over: as the gardeners say, he had gone to seed. 
'There are no horses for Sk, and there won't be any for a long time,' he said, 'but here are some ready to go to V.' 
The horses were soon ready. 
And the three horses went off at a slow trot. 
'Yes, they say so!' replied Rudin, his eyes straying about the room. 
But what fate brought you here?' 
'Good God!' thought Lezhnyov, 'how he has changed, poor fellow!' 
What friends I have madegood God! 
Let us drink to those days!' 
Rudin started and drew himself up a little, and there was a gleam in his eyes of something no word can express. 
'Well, I will tell you, Mihail,' he began. 
He was very wealthy and was the owner of extensive estates. His chief and only passion was love of science, universal science. 
It fitted him about as well as a saddle on a cow. 
So I struggled on there for two years. 
And I love you, Dmitri, for that, indeed I do!' 
My abilities are above the ordinary anyway, I am a master of language. 
They all loved me; I gave them all full marks in examinations. 
By her advice I drew up a plan.... 
He perfectly hated me; he compared my lectures to fireworks, pounced upon every expression of mine that was not altogether clear, once even put me to confusion over some monument of the sixteenth century.... But the most important thing was, he suspected my intentions; my last soapbubble struck on him as on a spike, and burst. 
'Yes, that's true; you have always been an enigma for me. 
'What is there to do! 
You are thinking perhaps at this moment: "Even now he cannot do without fine words!" 
Do you want to know what I think of you, Dmitri? 
I think: here is a manwith his abilities, what might he not have attained to, what worldly advantages might he not have possessed by now, if he had liked! ... and I meet him hungry and homeless ....' 
'Our paths lay apart,' continued Lezhnyov, 'perhaps exactly because, thanks to my position, my cool blood, and other fortunate circumstances, nothing hindered me from being a stayathome, and remaining a spectator with folded hands; but you had to go out into the world, to turn up your shirtsleeves, to toil and labour. 
We might differ and even quarrel in old days, when so much life still remained before us; but now, when the ranks are thinned about us, when the younger generation is coming upon us with other aims than ours, we ought to keep close to one another! 
The long autumn night came on. 
It is, at the same time, a slim line that separates those who know from those who don't. 
What comes as a real surprise is man's unrelenting insensitivity towards the numerous miracles he encounters, sees, hears, and knows – including his own body – and his negligence about the reason "why" these extraordinary details are presented to him. 
Though dwelling on a scientific subject, the purpose of "The Miracle in the Atom" is different from that of conventional scientific books. 
The first model, which has proven not to be viable, defended the proposition that the universe has existed for an infinite time and will exist endlessly in its current state. 
Hoyle and others continued to resist this but all scientific development worked against them. 
First, the Russian physicist Alexandre Friedmann discovered in 1922 that the universe did not have a static structure. 
Einstein stood up and announced that what he had just heard was "the most beautiful and satisfying interpretation I have listened to" and went on to confess that creating the "cosmological constant" was "the biggest blunder" of his life.1 
Confessions were forthcoming one by one from the names who had defended the "infinite universe" concept for years. 
Allah Created the Universe from Nothing 
Many scientists, be they believers or not, are obliged to admit this truth. 
Another matter in the Qur'an that could be interpreted as the expansion of the universe, which was discovered in the late 1920s. 
Scientists conducted numerous researches to understand the chronology of the events that took place during this process and the order of the rules of physics in effect at each phase. 
The Big Bang theory provides evidence for Allah's being by showing that all matter comprising the universe originated from nothingness. 
It did even more and showed that the building blocks – the atoms – also came into existence from nothing less than one second after the Big Bang. 
At that stage, the universe is approximately 14 seconds old, has a temperature of 3 billion degrees and continues to expand at a dramatic speed. 
Protons and neutrons have started to come together to form the atom, the building block of matter. 
Let us say that 10 units of electrons and 8 units of positrons meet. 
This formation introduces us to the fundamental forces we will commonly encounter in the universe. 
It is no doubt impossible for these particles, which are products of a design far beyond human comprehension and have distinct structures resting on extremely delicate balances, to have come together through coincidence and to act towards the same goal. 
While it is impossible for the particles required to form an atom to come together by chance and establish delicate balances, it would be far more unreasonable and illogical to claim that planets, galaxies, and in short, all systems that provide the workings of the universe to form by chance and develop balances by themselves. 
The words of famous physicist Prof. Stephen Hawking addressing this point are quite interesting. 
It tells us that God is not the universe itself, nor is God contained within the universe.10 
The origination of a universe with all the matter it contains from nothing is one of the greatest signs of Allah's might. 
This force is so strong that it almost causes the protons and neutrons within the nucleus to bind to each other. 
This force plays an important role in maintaining the equilibrium of the nuclei that contain high numbers of neutrons and protons. 
This force provides that particles with opposite electrical charges attract each other and particles with the same charge repel each other, therefore ensuring that the protons in the nucleus of the atom and the electrons travelling in the orbits around it attract each other. 
In both cases, it would become impossible for the atom and therefore, the material universe to exist. 
On the other hand, if gravity had been less powerful, no stars or galaxies would have ever formed. 
Supreme design and perfect order prevail in the entire universe constructed on a foundation provided by these fundamental forces. 
Air, water, mountains, animals, plants, your body, the chair on which you sit, in short, everything you see, touch, and feel, from the heaviest to the lightest is formed of atoms. 
Even at this unbelievable scale, the nucleus of our atom would not become any bigger than a very tiny grain of dust.15 
All the protons in the nucleus have positive charges and they repel each other because of the electromagnetic force. 
Probabilistic calculations, however, scientifically put the probability of the equilibriums in the universe being formed "coincidentally" at "0". 
There is a great space lying between the basic particles. 
Research conducted by particle physics revealed that the protons and neutrons making up the atom are actually formed of subparticles called "quarks". 
The quarks inside a proton can never be pulled apart from each other very much because the "strong nuclear force" that is responsible for keeping the particles inside the nucleus together operates here as well. 
Yet, the proportion of the size of the earth and the sun is very different from the atomic scale. 
An atom has the same number of electrons as protons and each electron bears a negative () charge equal to the positive (+) charge borne by each proton. 
In addition to these factors, if the nuclear forces binding protons and neutrons in the nucleus to each other did not exist, protons having equal charges could not even come close to each other, much less bond together in a nucleus. 
Every point in the universe reveals the intervention of an Owner of intellect and will Who does not leave even a single atom idle. 
This is an order that can by no means be attributed to coincidence. 
When electrons were first discovered, they were thought to be particles like the protons and neutrons found in the nucleus. 
The following words of Richard P. Feynman, the renowned Professor of Theoretical Physics, was to lay the whole confusion to rest: 
But what can I call it? 
Because scientists were never able to explain the behaviour of electrons, as a solution they gave a new name to it: "Quantum Mechanical Motion". 
The reason why some people can never figure a way out of this dilemma is that despite substantial evidence, they cannot accept that these incredible systems and equilibriums have been brought into existence by the sublime Creator. 
When these photons, arriving on earth from the sun, strike the atoms of objects on earth, the electrons of atoms sometimes begin their travel. 
Every step runs under a great plan and to order. 
Let us again list these steps that have to work according to plan and in order for the formation of a universe with colours instead of a dark one. 
When the electrons take in the energy of the photons they absorb, they jump to another shell having a higher level of energy. 
These electrons try to return to their original states. 
These photons emitted by the electrons determine the colour of that object. 
Let us now ask the following question: if you saw a working clock on the ground while walking in a desert, would you think that this had formed out of dust, sand, soil and stones by chance? 
Many materials look different and bear different properties although they contain the same atoms. 
Atoms are held together inside molecules by chemical bonds determined by the electromagnetic force of attraction, which means that these bonds are formed on the basis of the electrical charges of the atoms. 
The importance of the chemical bonds that lie at the heart of the diversity of matter come forward at this very point. 
Let us now, in brief, see the properties of these bonds and how they are formed. 
While some atoms swap electrons for bonding, some of them share the electrons in their outermost shells. 
The Building Block of Life: the "Carbon" Atom 
Over a quarter of a million have already been isolated and described, but this gives a very imperfect idea of its powers, since it is the basis of all forms of living matter. 
The class of compounds formed exclusively from carbon and hydrogen are called "hydrocarbons". 
The naphthalene that protects our clothes from moths is another hydrocarbon. 
What is in the heavens and in the earth belongs to Allah. 
Allah encompasses all things. 
In an effort to answer this question, chemists produced different theories. 
Proteins can function in living organisms only if they have these three dimensional patterns. 
How would the earth look if there were no water? 
The duration of a hydrogen bond is approximately one hundred billionth of a second. 
Water reaches its heaviest state at + 40 C, and as soon as it reaches this temperature, it immediately sinks to the bottom. 
It is found in the highest strata of the atmosphere. 
For this reason, the ozone layer serves as a protective shield in the atmosphere. 
These correspond to salty, sweet, sour and bitter tastes. 
Since we would have no idea about the concepts of taste and fragrance, it would not even occur to us to wish to possess these perceptions. However, it is not so. Out of the brown soil with a unique smell come hundreds of types of aromatic and delicious fruits, vegetables and flowers in thousands of colours, shapes and fragrances. 
As for other living beings, some eat only grass and some different foodstuffs. 
And when your Lord announced: "If you are grateful, I will certainly give you increase, but if you are ungrateful, My punishment is severe." 
The living being would immediately react with the substance on which he stepped, sat or leaned, and be transformed into something else. 
The final picture that emerges in this situation is extremely remarkable: we live in a world that is 99.95 % composed of a void filled with atoms consisting almost entirely of energy.37 We actually never touch the things we say, "we touch and we hold". 
Since atoms are inanimate particles, it is extremely astonishing for them to be the building blocks of living beings. 
Just as it is impossible to imagine pieces of stone coming together to form living organisms, so is it impossible to imagine inanimate atoms by themselves coming together to form living organisms. 
If we mix aluminium with plastic and gasoline, can it fly? 
Allah is He Who splits the seed and kernel. 
Some of the atoms making up the earth initially formed the land and later on, suddenly decided to form living beings! 
These atoms first transformed themselves into cells with highly complex structures and then produced copies of the cells they formed by splitting into two, after which they started speaking and hearing. 
Some atoms came together to form civil engineers who construct bridges and skyscrapers, while some others came together to manufacture satellites, space crafts and yet others specialised in the disciplines of physics, chemistry and biology. 
First of all, it is mathematically impossible for either DNA molecules or protein molecules that come in thousands of different types to sort out the appropriate sequences necessary for life by chance. 
These are theories based on the idea that an organizing principle that is apparently superior to matter is involved in the process.42 
He covers the day with the night, each pursuing the other urgently; and the sun and moon and stars are subservient to His command. 
The magnitude of this energy varies depending on the type of the element, because the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of each element is different. 
The reaction known as fission is a nuclear reaction in which an atomic nucleus splits into fragments, and the reaction called fusion is the bringing together of two nuclei by a great force. 
Fission is a nuclear reaction in which the atomic nucleus, which is held together by the strongest force in the universe, the "Strong Nuclear Force", splits into fragments. 
Each newly split nucleus behaves like the initial uranium nucleus. 
Another atom bomb dropped on Nagasaki by America three days after the Hiroshima disaster caused the death of another 40,000 people right at the moment of detonation. 
Nuclear fusion, just the contrary of fission, is the process of bringing together two light nuclei to form a heavier nucleus and using the bonding energy thus released. 
The heat and light coming from the sun is the result of hydrogen being fused into helium and energy being released in place of the matter lost during this conversion. 
The remaining 4 million tons of matter is converted into energy. 
This amount is like one gram of sand being lost out of a 5 kilogram rock in 3 billion years. 
Nobody knew how the sun produced energy. 
In the same way, the sun, which possesses such enormous power and energy, is created at the distance, with the power and the size which are perfect for all life on earth, and foremost, man. 
This gigantic mass and the incredible nuclear reactions occurring in it have been carrying on their activities for millions of years in perfect harmony with the earth and in the most controlled manner. 
The neutrons bombarding the uranium and which split the first atoms into fragments creates chain reactions within the mass as mentioned before. 
The temperature of the gas, into which the bomb is instantaneously converted, rises to several million degrees and the gas pressure rises to one million atmospheres. 
In the close surroundings of the explosion, a great amount of powderlike fine dust is raised. 
The chance of people staying alive at this pressure is 1%. 
The shock wave diffuses along the surface of the earth and it is followed by the explosion created by the repositioning of the air sent by the fireball. 
This upward motion causes the direction of wind on the earth to reverse and causes a strong wind to start blowing towards the centre, even though it was initially blowing outwards from the centre of the explosion. 
30 seconds after the explosion… 
This dust causes the abovementioned disorders depending on the degree of contamination. 
This is such a system that every one of the trillions of atoms forming the armchair on which we sit has an order about which a book could be written. 
If we assume that the atoms of your brain are directors, then we have to answer these questions: 
Why does not a single atom out of trillions of them oppose the decision that is taken? 
So, can it be correct to think that only one of these trillions of atoms is the director and the others are its followers? 
Why do the other atoms obey this atom unconditionally? 
Why and under what pretext do these particles come together to form this director atom? 
Which one of these countless atoms can be the director when it itself is made up of many subparticles? 
He then reads books made of atoms in a building made of atoms. 
"Little tyke," chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. 
There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. 
People in cloaks. 
The nerve of him! 
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. 
He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. 
He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. 
Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. 
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. 
He was rattled. 
Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. 
As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. 
"I suppose so," said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. 
Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. 
The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. 
Twelve times he clicked the PutOuter, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. 
He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. 
"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right," she said impatiently. 
She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark livingroom window. 
People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors." 
She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. "A fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnowWho seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. 
"We have much to be thankful for. 
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, "The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. 
It was plain that whatever "everyone" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. 
I know..." he said heavily. 
"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. 
"It's the best place for him," said Dumbledore firmly. 
I've written them a letter." 
He'll be famousa legendI wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the futurethere will be books written about Harryevery child in our world will know his name!" 
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, "Yesyes, you're right, of course. 
He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. 
And where did you get that motorcycle?" 
"No, sirhouse was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around. 
Scars can come in handy. 
I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. 
"Could Icould I say goodbye to him, sir?" asked Hagrid. 
Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply. 
Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. 
It had been a good one. 
Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. 
Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. 
"Comb your hair!" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. 
Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. 
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. 
Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. 
"I won't blow up the house," said Harry, but they weren't listening. 
"He always spspoils everything!" 
It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond. 
Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. 
Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's. 
"I know," Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him. 
As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, "Brazil, here I come.... 
Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. 
A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. 
Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day. 
Piers Polkiss was going there too. 
They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking. 
There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. 
"DotA be stupid," snapped Aunt Petunia. 
For a moment it looked as though she might faint. 
"Get out, both of you," croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope. 
"Vernon," Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, "look at the addresshow could they possibly know where he sleeps? 
"Watchingspyingmight be following us," muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. 
Tell them we don't want" Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen. 
"Go to your cupboardI mean, your bedroom," he wheezed at Harry. 
He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights. 
The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one. 
I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some clothes. 
Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her. 
"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. 
Great drops beat on the roof of the car. 
Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. 
Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all. 
Three minutes to go. 
Was the rock crumbling into the sea? 
He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. 
He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear. 
"ALL WHAT?" Hagrid thundered. 
But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, "About our world, I mean. 
"Yeh don' know what yeh are?" he said finally. 
A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage. 
I was there! 
Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard. "a what?" gasped Harry. 
And I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter." 
Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. 
"Knew!" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. 
But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!" 
"Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just asasabnormaland then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!" 
Harry Potter not knowin' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!" 
"I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin' hold of yeh, how much yeh didn't know. 
You was just a year old. 
He came ter yer house an'an" Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. 
And thenan' this is the real myst'ry of the thinghe tried to kill you, too. 
But he couldn't do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? 
As Hagrid's story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it beforeand he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh. 
Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, "I'm warning you, DursleyI'm warning youone more word... " 
"Good question, Harry. 
He'd spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn't they been turned into warty toads every time they'd tried to lock him in his cupboard? 
It had been such a good dream. 
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat. 
"Mm?" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots. 
"But if their house was destroyed" "They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy! 
"He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. 
Come on, then." 
"Yeahbut we'll go back in this. 
Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat." 
"There's a list there of everything yeh need." 
One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear 3. 
If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help trusting him. 
If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there. 
The people hurrying by didn't glance at it. 
Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all. 
For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. 
Harry didn't know what to say. 
"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last." 
"You bowed to me once in a shop." 
But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. 
Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. 
"Yeah, you'll be needin' one," said Hagrid, "but we gotta get yer money first." 
He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. 
There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. 
Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. 
"Got it," said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. The goblin looked at it closely. 
The Dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? 
Right, that should be enough fer a couple of terms, we'll keep the rest safe for yeh." 
"About once every ten years," said Griphook with a rather nasty grin. 
He had a bored, drawling voice. 
"Then I'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. 
Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. 
"I say, look at that man!" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. 
Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in. 
He was liking the boy less and less every second. 
"They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean." 
"Nothing," Harry lied. 
Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. 
When they had left the shop, he said, "Hagrid, what's Quidditch?" 
If he'd known who yeh werehe's grown up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. 
YouKnowWho was one." 
"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley." 
While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twentyone Galleons each and minuscule, glitteryblack beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). 
"Just yer wand leftA yeah, and I still haven't got yeh a birthday present." 
The last shop was narrow and shabby. 
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. 
An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. 
Well, I say your father favored itit's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course." 
Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a long, white finger. 
"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it," he said softly. 
Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. 
Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave." 
Try" Harry triedbut he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. 
"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here somewhereI wonder, nowyes, why notunusual combinationholly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple." Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. 
He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. 
Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. 
Harry swallowed. 
He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop. 
"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves," he said. 
Harry kept looking around. 
Everything looked so strange, somehow. 
Yeh've been singled out, and that's always hard. 
Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me.... 
Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. 
His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gonebut how had he done it? 
He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose. 
"All right, dear, well, have a good termsend me an owl when you get there." 
"Who?" 
"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please...." 
"You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo. 
A whistle sounded. 
Houses flashed past the window. 
And this is Ron, our brother. 
"Ohwell, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes," said Ron. 
"WellI remember a lot of green light, but nothing else." 
You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. 
"His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. 
He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. 
"You said YouKnowWho's name!" said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. 
What she did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. 
"They're not really frogs, are they?" 
No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her... do you want it? 
The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap. 
"I'm Ron Weasley," Ron muttered. 
Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad. 
No need to ask who you are. 
"You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. 
"Say that again," Ron said, his face as red as his hair. 
Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. 
"All rightI only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors," said Hermione in a sniffy voice. 
Harry peered out of the window. 
Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately." 
Harry shivered in the cold night air. 
"Everyone here? 
A tall, blackhaired witch in emeraldgreen robes stood there. 
Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. 
"How exactly do they sort us into houses?" he asked Ron. 
Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom. 
A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years. 
Nobody answered. 
A few people nodded mutely. 
"The Sorting Ceremony's about to start." 
Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. 
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thingnoticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. 
He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him. 
"Finnigan, Seamus," the sandyhaired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor. 
The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. 
Very difficult. 
Plenty of courage, I see. 
Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, JellO, rice pudding" As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families. 
On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons ("I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult"; "You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing"). 
Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape." 
And now, bedtime. 
A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him. 
He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. 
Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. 
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. 
People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. 
Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. 
She patrolled the corridors alone. 
Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. 
Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. 
By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile. 
Just then, the mail arrived. 
This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate. 
Hagrid Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again. 
It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls. 
Our newcelebrity." 
His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. 
More silence followed this little speech. 
Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. 
"Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?" 
He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter. 
"For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. 
Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. 
That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor." 
He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first weekwhy did Snape hate him so much? 
Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes. 
The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day. 
Had that been what the thieves were looking for? 
Flying lessons would be starting on Thursdayand Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. 
He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. 
Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. 
Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. 
At threethirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. 
The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. 
She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. 
It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles. 
"Stick out your right hand over your broom," called Madam Hooch at the front, "and say 'Up!" 
You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.' 
"Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies, Parvati." 
"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy," Harry called. 
"Catch it if you can, then!" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground. 
His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. 
Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. 
He hadn't even lasted two weeks. 
Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. 
Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. 
Charlie Weasley couldn't have done it." 
"Your father would have been proud," she said. 
It was dinnertime. 
"Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret passageway out of the school." 
Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle. 
They both looked up. 
"And it's really none of your business," said Harry. 
"I almost told your brother," Hermione snapped, "Percyhe's a prefect, he'd put a stop to this." 
He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole. 
"This way!" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. 
Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering. 
"Get out of the way," snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake. 
Peeves bellowed, "STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR" Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a doorand it was locked. 
"I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig." 
Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand. 
They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high. 
"I see what McGonagall meant... you really are a natural. 
"The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. 
Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box. 
That's why you have two Beaters on each teamthe Weasley twins are oursit's their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. 
"Erhave the Bludgers ever killed anyone?" Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand. 
"Never at Hogwarts. 
And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers unless they crack my head open." 
Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. 
"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. 
"You're saying it wrong," Harry heard Hermione snap. "It's Winggardium Leviosa, make the 'gar' nice and long." 
Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, "Wingardium Leviosa!" 
"I think she heard you." 
Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. 
"Why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?" 
Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside. 
Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind. 
The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly overand dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head. 
The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble. 
A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. 
Harry had never seen her look so angry. 
Hermione hung her head. 
Harry was speechless. 
It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets. 
It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else. 
Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said "Thanks," and hurried off to get plates. 
As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. 
Every morning the ground was covered in frost. 
The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. 
Harry gulped. 
In a low whisper, Harry told them what he'd seen. 
What's that dog guarding?" 
Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn't sleep. 
"You've got to eat some breakfast." 
"I don't want anything." 
"Thanks, Seamus," said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages. 
Wood cleared his throat for silence. 
"The big one," said Fred Weasley. 
I know it." 
He glared at them all as if to say, "Or else." 
The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall. 
"And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserveback to Johnson andno, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goesFlint flying like an eagle up therehe's going to scno, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quafflethat's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field andOUCHthat must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a BludgerQuaffle taken by the Slytherinsthat's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a second Bludgersent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell whichnice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goesshe's really flyingdodges a speeding Bludgerthe goal posts are aheadcome on, now, AngelinaKeeper Bletchley divesmissesGRYFFINDORS SCORE!" 
"Budge up there, move along." 
"Bin watchin' from me hut," said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, "But it isn't the same as bein' in the crowd. 
This was part of his and Wood's game plan. 
"Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing," Hagrid mumbled. 
He stared through his binoculars. 
Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. 
His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. 
It was enough. 
"Now, don't ask me anymore," said Hagrid gruffly. 
He didn't feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he'd ever had. 
Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie. 
Move along, all of you." 
"Just before the holidays? 
"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all," said Hermione. 
Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch. 
"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?" said Hermione. 
"It'd be safe to ask them." 
Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his familyin this case, his grandfather. 
"Merry Christmas," said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe. 
He unwrapped it. 
Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. 
"I've heard of those," he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione. 
It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material. 
Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your father left this in my possession before he died. 
"I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. 
"And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either," said George. 
Ron grunted in his sleep. 
Where should he go? 
Step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles. 
A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silencethe book was screaming! 
There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. 
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. 
Or were they all invisible, too? 
She was a very pretty woman. 
It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did. 
Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. 
He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. 
"Let's forget it and go back." 
"How can it? 
I want to see my parents." 
The snow still hadn't melted the next morning. 
So what if they can't see you? 
He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone. 
Harry shook his head. 
"Obviously, you've just done so," Dumbledore smiled. 
"Will you stop messing around!" he yelled. 
"Snape's refereeing?" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. 
He's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin." 
The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too. 
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. 
Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her. 
"He's used to walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier." 
And where's Malfoy? 
Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixtyfifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fiftyeight). 
It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match. 
As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. 
"The whole school's out there!" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. 
"Dumbledore?" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. 
"I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy," he stammered. 
Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet. 
"Well done," said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. 
He'd really done something to be proud of nowno one could say he was just a famous name any more. 
He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed. 
He recognized the figure's prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinnerwhat was going on? 
"II don't know what you "You know perfectly well what I mean." 
Everyone's waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens." 
"That's not ages, that's like a second to Nicolas Flamel." 
"Yer not still lookin' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?" 
Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. 
"Don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh?" 
They'll think I've told yeh" "See you later, then," said Harry. Hagrid shuffled off. 
"Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! 
The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. 
"So what on earths Hagrid up to?" said Hermione. 
Hagrid's chest swelled at these last words. 
Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he's not about ter steal it." 
"And you wouldn't tell anyone, would you? 
"Can't, Harry, sorry," said Hagrid. 
"But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?" said Hermione. 
But Hagrid wasn't listening. 
"Wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life," Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. 
Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. 
"Hagrid," said Hermione, "how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?" Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his facehe leapt to his feet and ran to the window. 
"Someone was lookin' through the gap in the curtainsit's a kidhe's runnin' back up ter the school." 
"He's too little. 
"I'm Ron, remember?" 
Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. 
When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. 
He kept threatening to tell her what really bit meI've told her it was a dog, but I don't think she believes meI shouldn't have hit him at the Quidditch match, that's why he's doing this." 
"It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday," said Hermione, but this didn't soothe Ron at all. 
"It's too late to change the plan now," Harry told Hermione. 
We'll have to risk it. 
How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. 
Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. 
A lamp flared. 
"Detention!" she shouted. 
"Malfoy's got detention! 
They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. 
Hermione was trembling. 
How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? 
"I would never have believed it of any of you. 
Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower. 
Now get back to bed, all of you. 
I've never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students." 
Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence. 
Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. 
He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't say a word. 
Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too. 
I bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won't you, eh?" he said, leering at them. 
"Oh yes... hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me.... 
They marched off across the dark grounds. 
Then they heard a distant shout. 
His relief must have showed in hisface, because Filch said, "I suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? 
Go on" Malfoy didn't move. 
He led them to the very edge of the forest. 
I found one dead last Wednesday. 
So me, Harry, and Hermione'll go one way and Draco, Neville, and Fang'll go the other. 
A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right. 
Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. 
"That wasn' no werewolf and it wasn' no unicorn, neither," said Hagrid grimly. 
"Were you going to shoot me?" 
Students up at the school. 
Well, that's something." Ronan sighed. 
He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again. 
"Mars is bright tonight," Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. 
A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, blackhaired andbodied and wilderlooking than Ronan. 
"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?" 
"Oh, a fair few... 
"Did that sound like hooves to you? 
Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what's bin killin' the unicornsnever heard anythin' like it before." 
"Stay on the path, I'll come back for yeh!" They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them. 
A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered.... 
Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. 
The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. 
"My name is Firenze," he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back. 
Bane kicked his back legs in anger. 
Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on. 
"Do you not understand why it was killed? 
Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? 
"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is usedfor?" 
"No," said Harry, startled by the odd question. 
Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?" 
"The unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there." 
"This is where I leave you," Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. 
He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. 
He was still shaking. 
It sounds like fortunetelling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic." 
Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it. 
Harry was rubbing his forehead. 
Harry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important. 
I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one." 
Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... butHarry suddenly jumped to his feet. 
"And did hedid he seem interested in Fluffy?" Harry asked, try ing to keep his voice calm. 
"It's tonight," said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. 
"Snape's going through the trapdoor tonight. 
"You shouldn't be inside on a day like this," he said, with an odd, twisted smile. 
Harry flushed. 
He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. 
"Why me?" 
"I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone first." 
He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! 
This was the first night he hadn't been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. 
Harry and Ron didn't talk much. 
"Do something," he said desperately. 
"You'll understand later, Neville," said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak. 
They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. 
I suppose it's here to break the fall. 
There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. 
All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. 
With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank. 
"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?" said Ron. 
"They're not birds!" Harry said suddenly. 
Winged keyslook carefully. 
"That big onethereno, therewith bright blue wingsthe feathers are all crumpled on one side." 
Behind the white pieces they could see another door. 
Ron turned to the other two. 
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took. 
They moved silently wherever he sent them. 
"Harrymove diagonally four squares to the right." 
The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet. 
The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. 
They had reached another door. "All right?" Harry whispered. 
They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. 
Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine's left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight. 
"This isn't magicit's logica puzzle. 
"Got it," she said. 
They looked at each other. 
"But Harrywhat if YouKnowWho's with him?" 
"Positive," said Hermione. 
"Here I come," he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp. 
Quirrell smiled. 
This couldn't be true, it couldn't. 
She broke my eye contact with you. 
I couldn't do anything with Dumbledore watching. 
Quirrell snapped his fingers. 
I'll be far away by the time he gets back...." 
"Yes," said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. 
"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much." 
Quirrell shivered suddenly. 
Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alleyhow could he have been so stupid? 
He'd seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron. 
Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell's turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again. 
He saw his reflection, pale and scaredlooking at first. 
It winked and put the Stone back in its pocketand as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. 
"Well?" said Quirrell impatiently. 
"I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore," he invented. 
"Get out of the way," he said. 
Then he turned slowly on the spot. 
"Harry Potter..." it whispered. 
I have form only when I can share another's body... but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds.... 
"LIAR!" Harry shouted suddenly. 
Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain." 
Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed "SEIZE HIM!" and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell's hand close on his wrist. 
"Master, I cannot hold himmy handsmy hands!" 
He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down... down... 
"Tokens from your friends and admirers," said Dumbledore, beaming. 
I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. 
"But sir, the Stone" 
"You got there? 
As for the Stone, it has been destroyed." 
After all, to the wellorganized mind, death is but the next great adventure. 
As much money and life as you could want! 
Always use the proper name for things. 
"Yes, himQuirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. 
"Just the one?" 
"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?" 
You see, only one who wanted to find the Stonefind it, but not use itwould be able to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. 
"Oh, very well," she said. 
"I always said he was off his rocker," said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was. 
After a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal. 
I told him! 
Yeh could've died! 
"Hagrid, he'd have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we're talking about, he'd have found out even if you hadn't told him." 
He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. 
"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fiftytwo; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twentysix and Slytherin, four hundred and seventytwo." 
"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin," said Dumbledore. 
"I have a few lastminute points to dish out. 
Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. 
Got past McGonagall's giant chess set!" 
Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. 
"There are all kinds of courage," said Dumbledore, smiling. 
It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts. 
"Not where I'm going, I promise you," said Harry. 
"There he is, Mom, there he is, look!" 
"Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley." 
Increasing numbers, however, are asking: "Why have such meetings not occurred already, since we ourselves are about to venture into space?" 
About fifty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking a small, parched valley, which was divided by a sluggish stream fed from snows in the mountains two hundred miles to the north. 
He never thought of his father again. 
His contentment vanished when he reached the stream. 
They could not be driven away, for they were armed with ferocious daggers on their foreheads—the natural weapons which the manapes did not possess. 
Every cave was silent, lest it also attract disaster. 
The tumult died away, and presently MoonWatcher could hear the sound of a body being dragged over rocks. 
If there was sufficient warning, the smaller predators could sometimes be scared away by shouts and screams. 
There was no nourishment here; so like a sensible manape, he continued on his way to the river and forgot all about the crystalline monolith, during the daily routine of shrieking at the Others. 
They were still a hundred yards from the New Rock when the sound began. 
It was barely audible, yet it stopped them dead, so that they stood paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging slackly. 
Now the spinning wheels of light began to merge, and the spokes fused into luminous bars that slowly receded into the distance, rotating on their axes as they did so. They split into pairs, and the resulting sets of lines started to oscillate across one another, slowly changing their angles of intersection. Fantastic, fleeting geometrical patterns flickered in and out of existence as the glowing grids meshed and unmeshed; and the manapes watched, mesmerized captives of the shining crystal. 
Without knowing why, he bent down and picked up a small stone. When he straightened up, he saw that there was a new image in the crystal slab. 
Often he felt nausea, but always he felt hunger; and from time to time his hands clenched unconsciously in the patterns that would determine his new way of life. 
The tribe still experienced occasional bad days, though these no longer threatened its very survival. 
There was no sound except the heavy breathing around him; the whole world seemed asleep. 
Then he went back into the cave and, for the first time in his life, had an unbroken night's sleep. 
Even in death, it was some time before anyone dared to approach the vanquished monster, but presently they closed in upon it, with their bone knives and saws. 
Like thunder and lightning and clouds and eclipses, the great block of crystal had departed as mysteriously as it had come. 
Having vanished into the nonexistent past, it never troubled MoonWatcher's thoughts again. 
Their bone clubs had increased their reach and multiplied their strength; they were no longer defenseless against the predators with whom they had to compete. 
When the ice had passed, so had much of the planet's early life—including the manapes. 
For in using clubs and flints, their hands had developed a dexterity found nowhere else in the animal kingdom, permitting them to make still better tools, which in turn had developed their limbs and brains yet further. 
In a sudden failure of perspective, brought on by his swift changes of speed and height, it seemed to Floyd that he was looking down on a small silver moth, caught in the beam of a flashlight. 
Takeoff's in five minutes," she said, gesturing into the empty twentypassenger cabin. 
Launching in fifteen seconds. 
Weight was slowly ebbing; the rockets were being throttled back as the ship eased itself into orbit. The thunder of the engines dropped to a muted roar, then a gentle hiss, then died into silence. If it had not been for the restraining straps, Floyd would have floated out of his seat; his stomach felt as if it was going to do so anyway. 
This trick of walking in free fall was immensely reassuring to disoriented passengers. 
A lot of people were sick—but no one died. 
The central axis of the Space Station, with its docking arms extended, was now slowly swimming toward them. 
At first his weight was so slight that he had almost to force himself downward by holding on to the handrail. 
Floyd, after checking that the Area Code for the United States was still 81, punched his twelvedigit home number, dropped his plastic allpurpose credit card into the pay slot, and was through in thirty seconds. 
He paused for breath, and tried to think of any other crises or problems that might arise during the days ahead. 
Dimitri was one of Floyd's best friends; and for that very reason, he was the last person he wished to talk to, here and now. 
Miller seemed about to choke on his drink, but Floyd was made of sterner stuff. He looked his old friend straight in the eye, and said calmly: "TMA1? 
Too much haste, for he had forgotten the onesixth of a gravity. 
That," Floyd answered with determination, "is what I intend to find out." 
Accidents, crimes, natural and manmade disasters, threats of conflict, gloomy editorials—these still seemed to be the main concern of the millions of words being sprayed into the ether. 
As Floyd quickly discovered, she came from Bali, and had carried beyond the atmosphere some of the grace and mystery of that still largely unspoiled island. 
One of his strangest, and most enchanting, memories of the entire trip was her zerogravity demonstration of some classical Balinese dance movements, with the lovely, bluegreen crescent of the waning Earth as a backdrop. 
They were still more than a thousand miles away when weight returned as the jets began their gentle but steady deceleration. 
Under its automatic controls, the shuttle was sliding down the starlit sky, toward that barren landscape glimmering in the light of the great gibbous Earth. Now a voice was calling somewhere above the whistle of the jets and the electronic beepings that came and went through the cabin. Clavius Control to Special 14, you are coming in nicely. 
Abruptly, a swirling cloud of dust hid everything, the jets gave one final spurt, and the shuttle rocked very slightly, like a rowboat when a small wave goes by. 
Since it was expensive and timeconsuming to cut a large underground base out of solid rock or compacted lava, the standard oneman "living module" was a room only about six feet wide, ten feet long, and eight feet high. 
With its complex of workshops, offices, storerooms, computer center, generators, garage, kitchen, laboratories, and foodprocessing plant, Clavius Base was a miniature world in itself. 
Unfortunately, not all nations had yet realized that fact. 
The mountains that had been so prominent just before landing had mysteriously disappeared, hidden from sight below the steeply curving lunar horizon. 
A series of flat plates arranged in a circle, each plate independently mounted and sprung, the flexwheel had many of the advantages of the caterpillar track from which it had evolved. 
The President has asked me to convey his appreciation of your outstanding work, which we hope the world will soon be able to recognize. 
This is Tycho," said Michaels, pointing to the central crater. "On this vertical photograph Tycho is even more conspicuous than when seen from Earth; then it's rather near the edge of the Moon. 
It showed a man in a bright red and yellow spacesuit standing at the bottom of an excavation and supporting a surveyor's rod marked off in tenths of a meter. 
The object before which the spacesuited man was posing was a vertical slab of jetblack material, about ten feet high and five feet wide: it reminded Floyd, somewhat ominously, of a giant tombstone. 
Indeed, it has nothing to do with the human race—for when it was buried, there were no humans. 
Rough surfaces almost everywhere, except for some crater bottoms. 
CONSTRUCTION: Generally moderately difficult because of slope, and numerous large blocks in loose material; excavation of lava difficult in some crater bottoms. 
But it was very much more than this; it was a selfcontained base in which twenty men could live and work for several weeks. 
No one could possibly get lost on the 200mile journey from Clavius Base to TMA1, even though it was still night and the sun would not rise for several hours. 
Three million years! The infinitely crowded panorama of written history, with its empires and its kings, its triumphs and its tragedies, covered barely one thousandth of this appalling span of time. 
That it had been buried, and quite deliberately, Dr. Michaels was absolutely sure. 
The—creatures—who designed it wanted to make sure it stayed put, barring major moonquakes. They were building for eternity." 
At last, one of man's oldest questions had been answered; here was the proof, beyond all shadow of doubt, that his was not the only intelligence that the universe had brought forth. 
Michaels shook his head. 
So far, the hard black material of the slab had resisted all the rather mild attempts that Michaels and his colleagues had made to obtain samples. 
They had no doubt that a laser beam would cut into it—for, surely, nothing could resist that frightful concentration of energy—but the decision to employ such violent measures would be left to Floyd. 
He had already decided that X rays, sonic probes, neutron beams, and all other nondestructive means of investigation would be brought into play before he called up the heavy artillery of the laser. 
Floyd had barely adjusted his straps when the vehicle slowly edged itself over the brink of a really terrifying incline, and began to descend a long, rubblecovered slope as steep as the roof of a house. 
The vehicle began to creep cautiously down a ramp of hardpacked rock, into the interior of the crater. 
Even in the brilliant earthlight, it was hard to see the object clearly; his first impression was of a flat rectangle that might have been cut out of carbon paper; it seemed to have no thickness at all. 
It was not hard to walk; indeed, in a paradoxical way the suit made him feel more at home than at any time since reaching the Moon. 
Three million years ago, something had passed this way, had left this unknown and perhaps unknowable symbol of its purpose, and had returned to the planets—or to the stars. 
He did not expect to find anything, for he knew that every square inch had already been gone over with microscopic care. 
At least ten kilowatts of raw heat must be falling on the slab; if there was anything inside, it must be rapidly cooking. 
He wondered again about its black color; that was ideal, of course, for absorbing solar energy. 
But he dismissed the thought at once; for who would be crazy enough to bury a sunpowered device twenty feet underground? 
About a quarter of an hour late, traveling at the speed of light, that pulse would reach its destination. 
The computers might never have perceived the connection between four peculiar sets of signals, from spaceprobes on independent orbits millions of miles apart. But as soon as he glanced at his morning report, the Radiation Forecaster at Goddard knew that something strange had passed through the Solar System during the last twentyfour hours. He had only part of its track, but when the computer projected it on the Planet Situation Board, it was as clear and unmistakable as a vapor trail across a cloudless sky, or a single line of footprints over a field of virgin snow. 
Discovery would still go to Jupiter; but she would not stop there. 
Tons of food and other expendables would thus be saved; almost as important, the team would be fresh and alert, and not fatigued by the tenmonth voyage, when they went into action. 
She would continue to swing around Saturn, on an orbit now so well determined that men would know exactly where to look for her a thousand years hence. 
They were almost free from the spikes and valleys, the electrical explosions that marked the activity of the waking brain—or even of the brain in normal sleep. 
Was Discovery II here, to take them back to Earth? 
If you are hungry, please press it." 
How much else had he forgotten: Did hibernation erase memory? 
Presently it went away, and he rested once more. 
While Earth remained centered in the crosswires, the vital communication link was intact, and messages could come and go along the invisible beam that lengthened more than two million miles with every day that passed. 
Poole and Bowman had often humorously referred to themselves as caretakers or janitors aboard a ship that could really run itself. 
If he was late, Hal had a variety of beeps and chimes to remind him of his duty, but they had never been used. 
His first official act of the day would be to advance the Master Hibernation Timer twelve hours. If this operation was missed twice in a row, Hal would assume that both he and Poole had been incapacitated, and would take the necessary emergency action. 
By 1000 this would be finished, and he would start on a study period. Bowman had been a student for more than half his life; he would continue to be one until he retired. 
He would prowl endlessly over ship's plans, circuit diagrams, and voyage profiles, or would try to assimilate all that was known about Jupiter, Saturn, and their farranging families of moons. 
The food, most of it freezedried, was uniformly excellent, and had been chosen for the minimum of trouble. 
Below this was a small "spacegarage" fitted with three airlocks, through which powered capsules, just large enough to hold a man, could sail out into the void if the need arose for extravehicular activity. 
Transferring to the moving section was as easy and automatic, after a little experience, as stepping onto a moving escalator. 
Veined with a delicate tracery of pipes for the cooling fluid, they looked like the wings of some vast dragonfly, and from certain angles gave Discovery a fleeting resemblance to an oldtime sailing ship. 
Then, if he felt like it, he would spend a couple of hours either reading or looking at a movie; and at midnight he would go to sleep—usually without any help from electronarcosis. 
When Bowman asked Hal for the telescopic display, a sparsely sprinkled star field flashed onto the screen. 
Though they were perfectly well aware that 7794 was only a lifeless, airless chunk of rock, this knowledge scarcely affected their feelings. 
It was the only solid matter they would meet this side of Jupiter—still two hundred million miles away. 
It was racing past them at almost thirty miles a second; they had only a few frantic minutes in which to observe it closely. 
The experiment, simple though it was in principle, taxed the accuracy of their equipment to the limits. 
Against this background, all the continents and oceans of Earth appeared no larger than India on the terrestrial globe. 
Sometimes, during lonely hours on the control deck, Bowman would listen to this radiation. 
There would be months in which they could play it back at leisure. 
There was, as had long been known, a trace of atmosphere. 
And yet—the great world below was not wholly dark. 
Aboard Discovery, now almost a quarter of a million miles away, the radio started to bring in the first authentic news from Jupiter. 
All that was visible was a yellow mist, flecked with patches of scarlet which moved past the camera at a dizzying rate—streaming upwards as the probe fell at several hundred miles an hour. 
The Poole family, grouped rather selfconsciously round the birthday cake on Earth, lapsed into a sudden silence. 
I am having difficulty in maintaining contact with Earth. 
Unless the narrow pencil beam was pointed precisely at Earth, they could neither receive nor transmit. 
What procedure do you suggest?" 
O. K.—let us have the hard copy." 
I probably did, a year ago. But there are eight thousand subsystems aboard. 
Also, confirm your approval our plan to go EVA and replace Alpha Echo three five unit prior to failure. 
"Make it reassuring," indeed! 
Poole made a final check of his tiny instrument panel. 
Then he paused, reported the situation to Bowman, and considered his next step. 
(One day, somebody had predicted, Earth would have a ring like Saturn's, composed entirely of lost bolts, fasteners, and even tools that had escaped from careless orbital construction workers.) 
The card slipped out of its slot with no difficulty; it did not jam, and none of the dozens of sliding contacts stuck. Within a minute, the spare was in place. But Poole was taking no chances. 
Restore control power." 
Er—Dave, I have a report for you." What's up?" We have another bad AE35 unit. My fault predictor indicates failure within twentyfour hours." 
There was the familiar view of Earth, now waxing past the halfmoon phase as it swept toward the far side of the Sun and began to turn its full daylight face toward them. 
The voice of Mission Control faded out. 
At the same moment, the Alert sounded, forming a wailing background to Hal's "Condition Yellow! Condition Yellow!" 
In the sudden silence that descended upon the control deck, the two men looked at each other with mingled embarrassment and concern. 
So Hal was right all the time." 
I'm sure of it. 
There was another long silence; then Poole called out: Hal, swing the pod light round twenty degrees left—thanks—that's O. K." 
The very faintest of warning bells sounded somewhere far down in the depths of Bowman's consciousness. 
At the moment of impact, Betty was still moving quite slowly; she had not been built for high accelerations. 
And then, almost as if in response to his plea, Poole waved back. 
No explanations had been volunteered, and he was afraid to demand one, for fear of the reaction it might produce. 
although he was innocent, a single slip of the tongue might bring disaster. 
I want to do this myself, Hal," he said. 
I order you to release the manual hibernation control." 
Nothing appeared to happen: there was no sound, no indication that the Sequencer had started to operate. 
Bowman could feel the first winds tugging at his body; within a second, he found it hard to stay on his feet. (The atmosphere was rushing out of the ship, geysering into the vacuum of space. Something must have happened to the foolproof safety devices of the airlock; it was supposed to be impossible for both doors to be open at the same time.) 
It swung open easily into the vacuum, and he stepped out into the now silent centrifuge. 
There was not another human being within half a billion miles. 
There was the hiss of a carrier wave as the ship's local transmitter was switched on; 
This would be a very tricky operation; 
A dozen units had been pulled out, yet thanks to the multiple redundancy of its design—another feature, Bowman knew, that had been copied from the human brain—the computer was still holding its own. 
my first instructor was Dr. Chandra. 
A spacesuited figure emerged, worked for a few minutes on the mounting, then returned to the pod. 
Without automatic control, he would have to keep readjusting the beam—but it should hold steady for many minutes at a time. 
he was doing his utmost to project confidence to the lonely man on the other side of the Solar System. 
At the moment, we do not know whether to hope or fear. 
The final orbit adjustments would be somewhat tedious, because of the constant need for checking, but this was no serious problem. 
After that, like any clumsy criminal caught in a thickening web of deception, he had panicked. 
If TMA1 had indeed sent a signal to the stars—perhaps with the help of some further device near Saturn—then it would not reach its destination for years. 
It was true that the Special Theory of Relativity had proved to be remarkably durable, and would soon be approaching its first centenary; 
but it had begun to show a few cracks. 
They were fond of using an expressive phrase coined by a Princeton mathematician of the last century: "Wormholes in space." 
The brain might linger for a little while as the last remnant of the organic body, directing its mechanical limbs and observing the universe through its electronic senses—senses far finer and subtler than those that blind evolution could ever develop. 
and when the trumpets of Doomsday echoed from the heavens, he could endure no more. 
The system of the rings looked like some delicate work of art, or a fragile toy to be admired but never touched. 
The immense system of rings now spanned the sky, and already the ship was passing over its outermost edge. 
But in the center of the arch there was a wide, dark gap, like the missing span of an uncompleted bridge, where the shadow of the planet lay across its rings. 
for the next few hours, every second would be occupied as he checked the braking maneuvers, already programmed by the computers on Earth. 
At last, the pale dawn lay ahead; 
as she coasted once more, though in reverse order, across the paths of all the inner moons. 
When Bowman had first observed Japetus, that curious elliptical patch, of brilliance had been partly in shadow, illuminated only by the light of Saturn. 
Discovery had become a satellite of a satellite. 
Spread out beneath them, the explorers saw a world swarming with life. 
When they had learned all that they could, they began to modify. 
Incidentally, the name you've given it is doubly inappropriate—there's still no trace of a magnetic field. 
It had waited three million years; it was prepared to wait for eternity. 
It was far too bright to be a star, but one could look directly at its tiny disk without discomfort. 
for the hibernation systems were useless with no computer to monitor them. 
He put these thoughts behind him, as the golden crescent of Saturn rose in the sky ahead. 
Now I'm right above it, hovering five hundred feet up. 
It's certainly solid enough—and if it isn't I'll blast off at once. 
But now it seemed to be receding from him; 
Yet despite its extent, all the surface that Bowman could see was tessellated into obviously artificia1 patterns that must have been miles on a side. 
Bowman remembered a description he had once heard of the dreaded Antarctic "whiteout"—"like being inside a pingpong ball." 
The pierced and faceted planet slowly rolled beneath him, without any real change of scenery. 
He was passing through a Grand Central Station of the galaxy. 
Even as he watched, that doorway closed. 
First there was a perfectly spherical swarm of stars, becoming more and more closely packed toward the center until its heart was a continuous glow of light. 
Its outer edges were illdefined—a slowly thinning halo of suns that merged imperceptibly into the background of more distant stars. 
if there were planets orbiting here he could not distinguish them from the stellar background. 
Perhaps they were indeed smoke, for this sun was so cold that real fire could exist here. 
It was too much to expect that he would also understand. 
Then light returned; and incredulity gave way to a heartsinking despair—for as he saw what lay around him, he knew that he must be mad. 
But the drawers in the desk would not open; they were dummies. 
If this is some kind of intelligence test, I've probably failed already. 
Without further hesitation, he walked back into the bedroom and began to undo the clamp of his helmet. 
Bowman weighed it in his hand, then broke off a piece and cautiously sniffed at it. 
With eyes that already held more than human intentness, the baby stared into the depths of the crystal monolith, seeing—but not yet understanding—the mysteries that lay beyond. 
—and there before him was the luminous whirlpool of the galaxy. 
They and I, yes, 
As the days passed my Turkish was improving and because of this I began to make friends with some of those who were working at Manisa. 
I got hold of my Turkish dictionary and looked up the word 'peach' in Turkish pronunciation (pıç). 
Foreign tongues are strange, don't you think..?" 
My gratitude also to Water Street Bookstore for tracking down so many of my research books, my father Richard Brown—mathematics teacher and author—for his assistance with the Divine Proportion and the Fibonacci Sequence, Stan Planton, Sylvie Baudeloque, Peter McGuigan, Francis McInerney, Margie Wachtel, André Vernet, Ken Kelleher at Anchorball Web Media, Cara Sottak, Karyn Popham, Esther Sung, Miriam Abramowitz, William TunstallPedoe, and Griffin Wooden Brown. 
And my wife, Blythe—art historian, painter, frontline editor, and without a doubt the most astonishingly talented woman I have ever known. 
The curator lay a moment, gasping for breath, taking stock. 
"I will tell you what you need to know." 
The curator spoke his next words carefully. 
If I die, the truth will be lost forever. 
Instinctively, he tried to scramble for cover. 
Saunière closed his eyes, his thoughts a swirling tempest of fear and regret. 
By the time anyone got to him, he would be dead. Even so, the fear that now gripped him was a fear far greater than that of his own death. 
The desperate task before him, he knew, would require every remaining second of his life. 
I'm sorry," Langdon said, "but I'm very tired and—" Mais, monsieur," the concierge pressed, lowering his voice to an urgent whisper. 
He hung up before the concierge could protest. 
He is the author of numerous books: The Symbology of Secret Sects, The An of the Illuminati, The Lost Language of Ideograms, and when I say he wrote the book on Religious Iconology, I mean that quite literally. 
She held up a copy of Boston Magazine. 
The hostess began reading choice excerpts from the inane article, and Langdon felt himself sinking lower and lower in his chair. 
Langdon was wide awake now. 
Langdon hesitated, feeling uncertain as the stranger's sallow eyes studied him. 
"It's after midnight." 
When Langdon saw the photo, his entire body went rigid. 
We had hoped that you might help us answer that very question, considering your knowledge in symbology and your plans to meet with him." 
One mile away, the hulking albino named Silas limped through the front gate of the luxurious brownstone residence on Rue La Bruyère. 
Empty. 
Yes?" a male voice answered. Teacher, I have returned." 
Their agreement was too great for coincidence." 
The keystone is here in Paris." 
Incredible. 
"How they mock us!" 
"But the church, it is a fortress. 
Pulling his shades, he stripped naked and knelt in the center of his room. 
Then, gripping one end of the rope, he closed his eyes and swung it hard over his shoulder, feeling the knots slap against his back. 
He whipped it over his shoulder again, slashing at his flesh. 
In the passenger seat, Robert Langdon felt the city tear past him as he tried to clear his thoughts. 
Outside, the city was just now winding down—street vendors wheeling carts of candied amandes, waiters carrying bags of garbage to the curb, a pair of late night lovers cuddling to stay warm in a breeze scented with jasmine blossom. 
On any given night, all across Europe, Interpol officials could pinpoint exactly who was sleeping where. 
Finding Langdon at the Ritz had probably taken all of five seconds. 
"Have you mounted her?" 
Langdon exhaled, savoring the sudden quiet. 
These were the gardens in which Claude Monet had experimented with form and color, and literally inspired the birth of the Impressionist movement. 
Langdon had once walked the Louvre's entire perimeter, an astonishing threemile journey. 
Despite the estimated five days it would take a visitor to properly appreciate the 65,300 pieces of art in this building, most tourists chose an abbreviated experience Langdon referred to as "Louvre Lite"—a full sprint through the museum to see the three most famous objects: the Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo, and Winged Victory. 
The controversial, neomodern glass pyramid designed by Chineseborn American architect I. M. Pei still evoked scorn from traditionalists who felt it destroyed the dignity of the Renaissance courtyard. 
It was a loaded question, of course. 
As Langdon stood alone and watched the departing taillights, he realized he could easily reconsider, exit the courtyard, grab a taxi, and head home to bed. 
Langdon wondered if any of Harvard's revered Egyptologists had ever knocked on the front door of a pyramid and expected an answer. 
He advanced with unmistakable authority on squat, powerful legs. 
"Your agent said Jacques Saunière himself did—" Mr. Langdon," Fache's ebony eyes locked on. 
Descending below ground level, Langdon fought a rising trepidation. 
"Yes, your pyramid is magnificent." 
"Obviously, someone gained entry tonight who should not have. 
It might be helpful." The pointedness of the question made Langdon uncomfortable. 
I felt honored to have been contacted at all. 
"Actually, nobody yet knows about my manuscript. 
The threehundredpage draft—tentatively titled Symbols of the Lost Sacred Feminine—proposed some very unconventional interpretations of established religious iconography which would certainly be controversial. 
The symbol was known as a crux gemmata—a cross bearing thirteen gems—a Christian ideogram for Christ and His twelve apostles. 
It's a crux gemmata" Fache said suddenly. Startled, Langdon glanced up to find Fache's eyes on him in the reflection. 
The elevator jolted to a stop, and the doors opened. 
Langdon stepped quickly out into the hallway, eager for the wideopen space afforded by the famous high ceilings of the Louvre galleries. 
Fache glanced over. 
This way," Fache said, turning sharply right and setting out through a series of interconnected galleries. 
Langdon followed, his vision slowly adjusting to the dark. 
He could taste the familiar tang of museum air—an arid, deionized essence that carried a faint hint of carbon—the product of industrial, coalfilter dehumidifiers that ran around the clock to counteract the corrosive carbon dioxide exhaled by visitors. 
Fache and Langdon were not to be disturbed under any circumstances. 
Containment security," Fache said, as they neared the grate. 
He motioned to the opening. 
The seventeenth floor is entirely residential. 
Men enter the building through the main doors on Lexington Avenue. 
Earlier this evening, within the sanctuary of his penthouse apartment, Bishop Manuel Aringarosa had packed a small travel bag and dressed in a traditional black cassock. 
Surely this is an admirable quest." 
Reason seldom worked, though. 
The group's popular website—www.odan.org—relayed frightening stories from former Opus Dei members who warned of the dangers of joining. 
We fear what we do not understand, Aringarosa thought, wondering if these critics had any idea how many lives Opus Dei had enriched. 
Five months ago, the kaleidoscope of power had been shaken, and Aringarosa was still reeling from the blow. 
They know not the war they have begun," Aringarosa whispered to himself, staring out the plane's window at the darkness of the ocean below. 
Excited, the bishop answered quietly. 
Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
Although the Grand Gallery housed the Louvre's most famous Italian art, many visitors felt the wing's most stunning offering was actually its famous parquet floor. 
As Langdon's gaze began to trace the inlay, his eyes stopped short on an unexpected object lying on the floor just a few yards to his left, surrounded by police tape. 
We have touched nothing. 
"So the curator actually captured his attacker inside the Grand Gallery?" 
They said he did that to himself. 
Langdon could not believe Rome had been only a year ago; it felt like decades. 
When we arrived, we raised the barricade enough to slip underneath, and I sent a dozen armed agents inside. 
The word's roots actually reached back to the Latin paganus, meaning countrydwellers. 
Saunière, of all people, would know this." 
Early religion was based on the divine order of Nature. 
Langdon decided not to share the pentacle's most astonishing property—the graphic origin of its ties to Venus. 
The original feminine meaning is correct, but the symbolism of the pentacle has been distorted over the millennia. 
We paint it on all our fighter jets and hang it on the shoulders of all our generals." 
So much for the goddess of love and beauty. Interesting." 
He'd been wondering the same thing ever since he first saw the Polaroid. 
Obviously he had nothing else to write with." 
Fache was silent a moment. 
"As I told you," he said, rummaging around the table, "we have touched nothing. 
"What the hell does this mean!" 
"That, monsieur, is precisely the question you are here to answer." 
The microphones were functioning flawlessly, and the audio feed was crystal clear. 
The nearby convent was her formal residence, if anyone asked, but she preferred the quiet of the church and had made herself quite comfortable upstairs with a bed, phone, and hot plate. 
What time is it? 
Although she recognized her boss's voice, in fifteen years she had never been awoken by him. 
The head of Opus Dei?" 
Langdon looked again at the digits, sensing it would take him hours to extract any symbolic meaning. 
Let me ask you this, Mr. Langdon. To your eye, beyond the numbers, what about this message is most strange?" 
Langdon knew Saunière spoke impeccable English, and yet the reason he had chosen English as the language in which to write his final words escaped Langdon. 
To Langdon's amazement, a rudimentary circle glowed around the curator's body. 
Moreover, the artist's eerie eccentricities projected an admittedly demonic aura: Da Vinci exhumed corpses to study human anatomy; he kept mysterious journals in illegible reverse handwriting; he believed he possessed the alchemic power to turn lead into gold and even cheat God by creating an elixir to postpone death; and his inventions included horrific, neverbeforeimagined weapons of war and torture. 
"All I am saying is that Mr. Saunière dedicated his life to studying the history of the goddess, and nothing has done more to erase that history than the Catholic Church. 
I believe Saunière wrote this note to tell us who killed him." 
Fache nodded. 
Fache frowned as if the idea had never occurred to him. 
You know what to do. 
The phone crackled like a walkietalkie. 
He gave Langdon a calm look of apology. 
Fache's anger stalled momentarily. 
If a code breaker had now arrived, it most likely meant someone had decrypted Saunière's message. 
Before I explain," Sophie said, "I have an urgent message for Mr. Langdon." 
A message from the States? 
"How would they know to find Mr. Langdon here?" 
I think you may have given me—" No, that's the right number," Sophie interjected quickly, as if anticipating Langdon's confusion. 
"But—" It's the threedigit code on the paper I gave you." 
Langdon opened his mouth to explain the bizarre error, but Sophie flashed him a silencing glare that lasted only an instant. 
Sophie's outgoing message immediately cut off, and Langdon heard an electronic voice announce in French: "You have one new message." 
Silas sat behind the wheel of the black Audi the Teacher had arranged for him and gazed out at the great Church of SaintSulpice. 
On either flank, a shadowy row of sleek buttresses jutted out like the ribs of a beautiful beast. 
Forgive those who trespassed against you. 
He had not realized it at the time. 
His name was not Silas then, although he didn't recall the name his parents had given him. 
A ghost with the eyes of a devil! 
The young man broke the first sailor's neck with his bare hands, and only the arrival of the police saved the second sailor from a similar fate. Two months later, in shackles, he arrived at a prison in Andorra. 
I am a ghost. 
The stone has been rolled aside, and you are born again. 
Fog shrouded his thoughts. 
The priest smiled. 
Where am I?" 
The ghost studied his young caretaker. Years had passed since anyone had shown any kindness. 
The ghost turned, frightened. 
It's time for breakfast," the priest said. 
"You will need your strength if you are to help me build this church." 
He had not revealed his own identity to Aringarosa, and yet he had proven himself a man well worth obeying. 
This code," Sophie explained in rapid French, "is simplistic to the point of absurdity. Jacques Saunière must have known we would see through it immediately." 
Like taking the words of a famous poem and shuffling them at random to see if anyone recognizes what all the words have in common." 
"I'll need to fly home first thing in the morning." 
Fache frowned inwardly at the delay. 
Langdon hesitated, pointing in the other direction toward the far end of the Grand Gallery corridor. 
I believe there's a much closer rest room at the end." 
Langdon shook his head, already moving deeper into the gallery. 
Granted, that system had now been reset, unlocking the stairwells, but it didn't matter—the external doors, if opened, would set off fire alarms and were guarded outside by DCPJ agents. 
Fache glanced out at the darkened hallway. 
Apparently Sophie had been in no mood to stop by and chat with the other officers on her way out. For a moment, Fache considered radioing the guards in the entresol and telling them to stop Sophie and drag her back up here before she could leave the premises. 
The red dot was clearly visible on the floor plan overlay, blinking methodically in a room marked TOILETTES PUBLIQUES. 
Robert Langdon felt lightheaded as he trudged toward the end of the Grand Gallery. 
Do not react to this message. 
Just look." Bewildered, Langdon reached his hand into his tweed jacket's left pocket—one he never used. Feeling around inside, he found nothing. 
It was a metallic, buttonshaped disk, about the size of a watch battery. 
Langdon flashed back to the hotel room... his quick shower, getting dressed, the DCPJ agent politely holding out Langdon's tweed coat as they left the room. 
If you throw it out, the signal will stop moving, and they'll know you found the dot. The only reason Fache left you alone is because he can monitor where you are. 
Fache uploaded images of the crime scene to the Cryptology Department earlier tonight in hopes we could figure out what Saunière's message was trying to say. 
Why would Saunière write this?" Langdon demanded, his confusion now giving way to anger. 
"Fache has more than enough evidence to take you into custody for questioning." 
"That particular sketch has always been my favorite Da Vinci work. 
Hold on. 
This is all coming out of order. 
Collet shook his head. 
Still Fache seemed preoccupied. 
It's about Sophie Neveu, sir. 
A weapon of death has no place in a house of God. 
Their nubile bodies sent a familiar longing to Silas's loins. 
A vow of celibacy and the relinquishment of all personal assets hardly seemed a sacrifice. 
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes... 
Something terrible has happened." 
Standing in the kitchen of her Paris flat, Sophie felt a chill to hear him again after all these years. 
Do you not yet understand?" 
"We must speak at once. 
Now you must know the truth. 
Their car went off a bridge into fastmoving water. 
Her disgust for the man deepened. 
Sophie's passion and aptitude for cryptography were a product of growing up with Jacques Saunière—a fanatic himself for codes, word games, and puzzles. 
The connection was flimsy. 
Sophie took a deep breath and probed further. 
Considering tonight's events, she would be a fool not to be frightened. 
"Bezu Fache will be taking you into custody at any minute. 
I will do that," Sophie said, speaking hurriedly, "but after you're safely inside the U. S. Embassy. 
Fache has made it his mission tonight to prove you are guilty. 
Turning toward the window, Sophie gazed through the alarm mesh embedded in the plate glass, down the dizzying forty feet to the pavement below. A leap from this height would leave Langdon with a couple of broken legs. 
Collet was speechless. 
The director said she never once mentioned Saunière to him, and he assumed it was because she probably didn't want preferential treatment for having a famous grandfather." 
No wonder she was upset by the pictures. 
But Fache was already in motion. 
What's going on? he wondered. 
The signal seemed to shudder for a moment, and then the blinking dot came to an abrupt stop about ten yards outside the perimeter of the building. 
The alarm was getting louder now. 
Fache kept running, cursing the length of the hallway with every step. 
He ran to the opening and looked over the edge. 
Fache could not imagine anyone risking a stunt like this. 
The only vehicle on Pont du Carrousel was an enormous twinbed Trailor delivery truck moving southward away from the Louvre. 
Sure enough, the Trailor truck that had crossed the bridge was slowing down and making a right turn onto Pont des SaintsPeres. So be it, Fache thought. 
I want to be there when we make the arrest." 
With a little aim, you can get out of here," she said. 
Up the street, an enormous twinbed eighteenwheeler was headed for the stoplight beneath the window. 
Now that the guards are leaving the perimeter, we can get out of here." 
Silas was accustomed to people being uncomfortable with his appearance. 
"I had my calling in Spain, and I now study in the United States." 
She is more beautiful by day." 
The abbé requested it. 
You obviously have powerful friends." 
You are in Paris a short time. 
"That goes without saying. 
He turned his massive body fully toward the small woman, and he could sense her recoil as she gazed up into his red eyes. 
She looked uneasy. 
Prayer is a solitary joy." 
The sudden dread in her soul made it hard to stay still. 
For a fleeting instant, she wondered if this mysterious visitor could be the enemy they had warned her about, and if tonight she would have to carry out the orders she had been holding all these years. 
"He said he had to tell me something. 
He wished he could comprehend the message, both for Sophie's wellbeing and for his own. 
The game's twentytwo cards bore names like The Female Pope, The Empress, and The Star. 
Langdon was surprised. 
He felt himself suddenly reeling back to Harvard, standing in front of his "Symbolism in Art" class, writing his favorite number on the chalkboard. 
Who can tell me why?" 
PHI's ubiquity in nature," Langdon said, killing the lights, "clearly exceeds coincidence, and so the ancients assumed the number PHI must have been preordained by the Creator of the universe. 
This is amazing!" someone cried out. 
Everyone in class gave him a dubious look. 
The mysterious magic inherent in the Divine Proportion was written at the beginning of time. 
The girls in class beamed. 
She had been pondering the words all night and had not seen a code. 
You think this message is... une anagramme?" 
She felt small and insignificant as she gazed up at the enormous ceilings and down at the dizzying floor. 
"French at school. 
He gave her a tired laugh. 
Then let's speak English just for fun." 
Not many people get a chance to visit her alone." 
Swallowing her apprehension, Sophie moved slowly across the room. 
Sophie considered the risk. 
I'll take my chances. 
The signs will lead you to a security turnstile. 
Do you know how to get to the embassy?" 
"I have to go see." 
As he moved down the hallway, Langdon wondered if at any moment he might awake with a start in his bed in Cambridge. 
I'm about to dash out of the Louvre... a fugitive. 
Saunière's clever anagrammatic message was still on his mind, and Langdon wondered what Sophie would find at the Mona Lisa... if anything. She had seemed certain her grandfather meant for her to visit the famous painting one more time. 
Wheeling, he stared back in the direction from which he had come. 
Is there time? He knew it didn't matter. 
But when Silas added that the brothers had all given him a precise location, with relation to a brass line running through SaintSulpice, the Teacher had gasped with revelation. 
Originally known as the Wind Rose, it denoted the directions of the thirtytwo winds, blowing from the directions of eight major winds, eight halfwinds, and sixteen quarterwinds. 
To this day, the fundamental navigational tool was still known as a Compass Rose, its northernmost direction still marked by an arrowhead... or, more commonly, the symbol of the fleurdelis. 
But it had not always been. 
Then he turned left and followed the brass line due north toward the obelisk. 
Sophie arrived breathless outside the large wooden doors of the Salle des Etats—the room that housed the Mona Lisa. 
Kept appalling secrets! 
The Salle des Etats was one of this museum's rare culsdesac—a dead end and the only room off the middle of the Grand Gallery. 
Unable to look at her grandfather, she focused solely on the PTS tools. 
Sophie jumped back. There you are!" 
Her relief was only momentary. 
I know, but did you ever see them anywhere else? 
Sophie had indeed seen the initials P. S. once before, in a kind of monogram. 
It was the day before her ninth birthday. 
Even then, she could not bear secrets kept from her. 
It looked like a pocket watch chain, but she knew he didn't wear one. 
Spellbound, she held it up. 
If you had lost it..." 
She solved this one too, racing on to the next card. 
Running wildly, she darted back and forth across the house, from clue to clue, until at last she found a clue that directed her back to her own bedroom. 
"I thought you might like this even better." 
I never saw a key like that. 
Her grandfather's eyebrows raised the way they always did when he was about to give her a challenge. 
Her grandfather lowered his voice and looked around as if to make sure no one was listening. 
"I have secret initials?" 
From that day on, they never again spoke of the key. 
The initials," Langdon whispered, eyeing her strangely. "Have you seen them?" 
Never speak of this key, Sophie. 
When I was very young." 
The two men share a historical fraternal bond. 
You're telling me this group is a pagan goddess worship cult?" 
But more important, they are known as the guardians of an ancient secret. 
Sophie realized now that Langdon knew far more about her grandfather than she had previously imagined. 
Following the brass line closer to the obelisk, he knocked on each tile adjacent to the brass line. 
This visitor was not who he seemed. 
You are not the only one with secrets, she thought. 
Moreover, all the access codes werefivedigit. 
What was your name again?" 
But the man had hung up. 
Keying into the cell phone's menu, Fache pulled up the list of recently dialed numbers and found the call Langdon had placed. A Paris exchange, followed by the threedigit code 454. 
Fache's blood was boiling as he typed the numbers 4... 
Despite her monumental reputation, the Mona Lisa was a mere thirtyone inches by twentyone inches—smaller even than the posters of her sold in the Louvre gift shop. 
Since taking up residence in the Louvre, the Mona Lisa—or La Jaconde as they call her in France—had been stolen twice, most recently in 1911, when she disappeared from the Louvre's satte impénétrable"—Le Salon Carre. 
Parisians wept in the streets and wrote newspaper articles begging the thieves for the painting's return. 
Langdon's jail seminar was part of a Harvard outreach program attempting to bring education into the prison system—Culture for Convicts, as Langdon's colleagues liked to call it. 
I heard he was a fag," said a small man with a goatee. 
Langdon was stunned. 
Amon is indeed represented as a man with a ram's head, and his promiscuity and curved horns are related to our modern sexual slang horny.' 
At first Langdon saw nothing. 
Jacques Saunière had indeed paid a visit to the Mona Lisa before he died. 
Did I hear Fache correctly? 
Have any fire alarms gone off there?" 
And no one has come out under the Grand Gallery gate?" 
Sophie looked at him in confusion. 
To this day, radical thought was considered left wing, irrational thought was left brain, and anything evil, sinister. 
"Someone's coming!" 
The guard hurried over and kicked his legs apart, spreading Langdon out. 
The Vitruvian Man, he thought. 
Iron on marble. 
Quickly pulling the remaining pieces from the opening, Silas gazed into the void. 
His blood pounded as he knelt down before it. 
The secret location of that which they sought was revealed in a Bible verse? 
Getting on her hands and knees, she reached beneath her wooden bed frame and retrieved the sealed envelope she had hidden there years ago. 
Trembling, she began to dial. 
Still aiming his weapon at Langdon, Grouard began backing slowly toward the entrance. 
Grouard was sweating now. 
She used to come in here as a little kid, but that was years ago. 
As Grouard inched backward, he could see the woman across the room raising her UV light and scrutinizing a large painting that hung on the far side of the Salle des Etats, directly opposite the Mona Lisa. 
Grouard gasped, realizing which painting it was. 
Her eyes shot upward, climbing the long cables that dangled from the ceiling to support the canvas. 
A shimmering gold chain dangled off it. 
A tightness gripped her throat as she realized that her grandfather, even in death, had kept his promise. 
This key opens a box, his voice was saying, where I keep many secrets. 
The extra surveillance wiring in the walls made it virtually impossible to get a carrier unless you stepped out into the hall. 
Another few meters, Grouard told himself, keeping his gun leveled. 
I can't put a bullet through a Da Vinci! 
Set down your gun and radio," the woman said in calm French, "or I'll put my knee through this painting. 
That's Madonna of the Rocks!" 
You chose a valuable hostage," he said as they ran. 
Shaking, she set the phone back in the cradle. 
She's kidding, right? The vehicle was easily the smallest car Langdon had ever seen. 
It was large enough to swallow their SmartCar in a single gulp. 
Fortunately, Sophie decided on the more conventional route, jamming the wheel hard to the right, circling properly until she exited, cut left, and swung into the northbound lane, accelerating toward Rue de Rivoli. 
The twotone police sirens blared louder behind them, and Langdon could see the lights now in his side view mirror. 
The SmartCar engine whined in protest as Sophie urged it faster away from the Louvre. 
As they straightened out, Langdon turned in his seat, craning his neck to look out the rear window toward the Louvre. 
"That was interesting." 
Langdon's students were always amused to learn that Da Vinci eventually mollified the confraternity by painting them a second, "watereddown" version of Madonna of the Rocks in which everyone was arranged in a more orthodox manner. 
A lasertooled varying matrix. 
Rather than teeth that moved tumblers, this key's complex series of laserburned pockmarks was examined by an electric eye. 
On weekends, he usually— Grinning, Sophie ran out to the garage. 
What she saw inside made no sense at all. 
The voices were clearer now. 
Feeling around the edge of the panels, Sophie found a recessed fingerhold. 
Sophie slipped through the door and found herself on a roughhewn stone staircase that spiraled downward. She'd been coming to this house since she was a child and yet had no idea this staircase even existed! 
The chanting grew steady again. 
Thundering now. 
A hundred yards ahead, the intersection was blocked by a couple of DCPJ police cars, parked askew, their purpose obvious. 
"Sophie," he said, "this is the seal I told you about! 
Langdon remained silent as he turned the cruciform in his hand, examining it. 
How about my hosts at the American University of Paris?" 
"Let's call the embassy. 
I can explain the situation and have the embassy send someone to meet us somewhere." 
Credit cards?" 
Pulling back the sleeve of his jacket, he checked his watch—a vintage, collector'sedition Mickey Mouse wristwatch that had been a gift from his parents on his tenth birthday. 
Barely making two green lights, she reached the third intersection and took a hard right onto Boulevard Malesherbes. 
Vendors manned carts of sandwiches and mineral water while grungy kids in backpacks emerged from the station rubbing their eyes, looking around as if trying to remember what city they were in now. 
Those days are gone. 
Now, rather than being humbled by his unexpected rise to power, the Holy Father had wasted no time flexing all the muscle associated with the highest office in Christendom. 
He reminded them that previous tempering of Church law—the Vatican II fiasco—had left a devastating legacy: Church attendance was now lower than ever, donations were drying up, and there were not even enough Catholic priests to preside over their churches. People need structure and direction from the Church, Aringarosa insisted, not coddling and indulgence! 
"Your meeting is at Castel Gandolfo." The Pope's summer residence? 
Nonetheless, there it is, he thought as Castel Gandolfo came into view, rising against a starfilled November sky. 
Trying to ease his nerves, the bishop meditated on the purple amethyst in his ring. 
A lone taxi sat idling by the doorway. The driver saw Sophie and flicked his lights. 
Nothing. 
Squinting, he brought the key close to his eyes and examined the rim of the head. 
"Yes, it's alcoholbased, like it's been buffed with a cleaner or—" Langdon stopped. 
We can shock the visiting American. 
She paused, locking eyes with him as the taxi raced westward. 
Then contact the taxi company dispatcher with descriptions. 
Used a bank card in desperation. 
I plan to run Neveu's employment file—friends, family, personal contacts—anyone she might turn to for help. 
I don't know what she thinks she's doing out there, but it's going to cost her one hell of a lot more than her job!" 
Langdon turned his gaze back inside the cab and took a deep breath. 
Langdon nodded, unable to imagine a less congruous a backdrop for the legend he was about to tell. 
The Priory vowed that no matter how long it took, these documents must be recovered from the rubble beneath the temple and protected forever, so the truth would never die. 
In order to retrieve the documents from within the ruins, the Priory created a military arm—a group of nine knights called the Order of the Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon." 
Because the documents remain the source of constant investigation and speculation even today, they are believed to have been moved and rehidden several times. 
Hundreds of books have been written about it, and few mysteries have caused as much interest among historians as the Sangreal." 
Langdon nodded. 
"You're just used to hearing it called by the name 'Holy Grail.' 
"How much simpler could it be?" 
The page listed a bibliography of over fifty titles—books by wellknown historians, some contemporary, some centuries old—many of them academic bestsellers. 
"As you can see, Jonas, this is not only my theory. 
He's a believer, Jonas, along with all of the others on that list." 
Throughout history, the Holy Grail has been the most special." 
He touched the accelerator, testing the gas. 
"What are you doing?" 
My friend," Aringarosa had told him, "you were born an albino. Do not let others shame you for this. 
The Lord has freed you for a reason. 
He sensed it was an object of enormous consequence. 
Others insisted that the suspicious placement of disciples in The Last Supper was some kind of code. 
Seracini had revealed beyond any doubt that while the Adoration's graygreen sketched underdrawing was indeed Da Vinci's work, the painting itself was not. 
Visitors at the gallery's Leonardo Room now found a misleading and unapologetic plaque where the Adoration once hung. 
"We have an extremely secure key, stamped with the Priory of Sion seal, delivered to us by a member of the Priory of Sion—a brotherhood which, you just told me, are guardians of the Holy Grail." 
She wondered if this were the moment to tell Langdon what she had witnessed that night in the Normandy château. 
"We are grateful you have come so far. 
"You have acted more quickly than we imagined." Have I?" 
Inside were two thick stacks of bonds, each embossed with the Vatican seal and the title PORTATORE, making the bonds redeemable to whoever was holding them. 
The cardinals exchanged uneasy looks, and finally one said, "Yes, but these bonds are traceable directly to the Vatican Bank." 
We are all in this together now. 
"Now, I imagine you have something for me to sign?" 
"Your service to the Church will never be forgotten." 
Something tells me it will fit," Langdon said. 
The private garage was small and dim, with spaces for about a dozen cars. 
Talk about mixed messages, Langdon thought. 
With pleasure, Langdon thought, sliding the pistol under the seat. 
Sophie and Langdon got out and walked up the red carpet toward the slab of steel. 
As the line rang, the guard switched the television back on and stared at it. 
"This room is yours as long as you care to use it." 
On our gold accounts, the shortest safetydeposit box lease is fifty years. 
Langdon stared. 
He walked them to the far wall where a wide conveyor belt entered the room in a graceful curve, vaguely resembling a baggage claim carousel. 
If you need anything at all, simply press the call button on the table in the center of the room." 
You mentioned that we enter an account number?" 
The man paused at the door, looking pale. 
You have a key and a personal account number known only to you. 
Leaving, the banker closed the door behind him and twisted a heavy lock, sealing them inside. Across town, Collet was standing in the Gare du Nord train terminal when his phone rang. 
Any leads yet on what Saunière was trying to tell Agent Neveu and Robert Langdon?" 
"My assistant tells me you have a gold key but no account number? 
Might I ask how you came by this key?" 
Earlier this evening. 
"I need to ask you both a very important question." 
She quickly told Vernet who Langdon was and what had happened inside the Louvre tonight. 
Vernet gave a helpless sigh. 
This bank obviously did not want to risk someone stealing a key and then holding an employee hostage for the account number. 
That is the definition of a Geldschrank bank." 
She reached out to the gold key and flipped it over, watching the man's eyes as she revealed the Priory of Sion seal. 
"Stay here. 
Sophie had no idea what he was talking about. 
Sophie grabbed the computer printout and followed. 
ACCOUNT NUMBER: 1332211185 When he had typed the last digit, the screen refreshed again. A message in several languages appeared. 
"Moreover, with my grandfather's love of symbolism and codes, it seems to follow that he would have chosen an account number that had meaning to him, something he could easily remember." 
At least nothing they could detect. 
The box coasted to a stop directly in front of them. 
Then she glanced over at Langdon. 
Rosewood, Sophie realized. 
She and Langdon exchanged puzzled looks. 
Sophie immediately closed the lid and looked up. 
This changed everything. 
But with the police already having set up a roadblock, Vernet could imagine only one way to do that. 
"Mademoiselle Neveu, if I can get you safely out of the bank, will you be taking the item with you or returning it to the vault before you leave?" 
He was sweating now. 
Your bank is demanding a search warrant before we can enter." 
Vernet stared at the agent and forced an obnoxious laugh. 
Vernet shook his head. "Not the cargo area. 
I'll sell it to you for forty." 
The agent paused and finally stepped aside. 
Tonight's second session with the Discipline had left him dizzy and weak. 
Our battle, like all battles, will take sacrifice. 
Vernet said he would take us a safe distance out of the city. 
In contrast to the warm colors of the rosewood box, the inlaid rose had been crafted of a pale wood, probably ash, which shone clearly in the dim light. 
Even in the diffuse light, Sophie could see Langdon's surprise. 
He made me one of these when I was little," Sophie said. 
As their armored truck roared down the highway, Sophie explained to Langdon that the cryptex had been Da Vinci's solution to the dilemma of sending secure messages over long distances. 
Unfortunately, if a messenger suspected the letter might contain valuable information, he could make far more money selling the information to adversaries than he could delivering the letter properly. 
Once information was sealed inside the cryptex, only the individual with the proper password could access it. 
We require a password," Sophie said, pointing out the lettered dials. 
If you align the dials in the proper position, the lock slides open. 
No, the cards always contained another riddle or clue. 
Exactly. 
"That's strange, because my grandfather always told me the Rose meant secrecy. 
"Sub... rosa," he choked, a fearful bewilderment sweeping across his face. 
In English we call it a keystone." 
Keystones. 
And, of course, an abundance of cinquefoils—the fivepetaled decorative flowers often found at the top of archways, directly over the keystone. 
Langdon nodded. "I forgot you'd had experience with this sort of thing." 
In cryptology, that's called a 'selfauthorizing language.' 
Langdon hesitated a moment. 
I can only assume it was the Priory." 
After all, previous Priory Grand Masters had also been distinguished public figures with artistic souls. 
Every Priory historian and Grail buff had read the Dossiers. 
Even if Saunière feared his own death, there were three sénéchaux who also possessed the secret and therefore guaranteed the Priory's security. 
And why involve Langdon... a total stranger? 
Gravel crunched beneath the tires. 
"Mademoiselle Neveu, I don't know how you got that key and account number tonight, but it seems obvious that foul play was involved. 
I told you," Sophie said, "we had nothing to do with my grandfather's death!" 
Langdon lifted the box. Now bring it over to me." 
Stand up, and step away from the box." 
Something is blocking it! 
Sophie Neveu was shouting. 
No service in the mountains? 
The truck's lone working headlight had been knocked offcenter and was casting a skewed sidelong beam into the woods beside the country highway. 
It answers a lot of questions—the issue of your grandfather's desperation to pass on the keystone, as well as the intensity with which Fache is hunting me." 
Pulling onto the shoulder, he brought the truck to a stop. 
My grandfather left me a phone message, Sophie had told him. 
At the time it had meant nothing, but now, knowing the Priory of Sion was involved, Langdon felt a startling new possibility emerge. 
They had no idea how to open the cryptex, or why Saunière had given it to them. 
Think, Sophie! 
Use your head. 
Do you know how to get to Versailles?" 
Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had been able to get mourning; Sonia was wearing dark brown, and Katerina Ivanovna had on her only dress, a dark striped cotton one. 
Then once more with pride and dignity she scanned her visitors, and suddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf man: "wouldn't he have some more meat, and had he been given some wine?" 
He simply gazed about him with his mouth open, which only increased the general mirth. 
He respected me, he respected me very much! 
In another minute she would have been ready to make a scene. 
"Allow me to ask what are you alluding to," began the clerk, "that is to say, whose... about whom... did you say just now... 
Raskolnikov sat in silence, listening with disgust. 
She knew that she, Sonia, was the chief reason for the 'genteel' ladies' contemptuous treatment of Katerina Ivanovna's invitation. 
Sonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had already heard this and an insult to Sonia meant more to Katerina Ivanovna than an insult to herself, her children, or her father, Sonia knew that Katerina Ivanovna would not be satisfied now, "till she had shown those draggletails that they were both..." 
To my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great deal cleverer, anyway one can see that he has addled his brains with drink, but you know, these foreigners are always so well behaved and serious.... 
But this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she at once declared, so that all could hear, that Amalia Ivanovna probably never had a father, but was simply a drunken Petersburg Finn, and had certainly once been a cook and probably something worse. 
Katerina Ivanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and apparently calm voice (though she was pale and her chest was heaving) observed that "if she dared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a level with her papa, she, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear her cap off her head and trample it under foot." 
Sonia stood deadly pale, staring at Luzhin and unable to say a word. 
At that moment you entered (at my invitation) and all the time you were present you were exceedingly embarrassed; so that three times you jumped up in the middle of the conversation and tried to make off. 
You thanked me and even shed tears. I describe all this as it took place, primarily to recall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest detail has escaped my recollection. 
Kindly consider the position. Mr. Lebeziatnikov I cannot suspect. I am ashamed to allude to such a supposition. 
Why, she'd give away her last penny!" and Katerina Ivanovna broke into hysterical laughter. "Did you ever see such an idiot?" she turned from side to side. 
Search her! 
Since she's not left the room, the money would have to be on her! 
But I am not so submissive, let me tell you! 
The wail of the poor, consumptive, helpless woman seemed to produce a great effect on her audience. 
Again there was a silence. 
Pyotr Petrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment. 
I have heard everything. I kept waiting on purpose to understand it, for I must own even now it is not quite logical.... 
How could I have given it to her?" 
You are the only one to take her part! She is an orphan. 
"A pack of nonsense!" yelled Luzhin, roused to fury, "it's all nonsense you've been talking! 
So I gave it to her on the sly on purpose? 
So far from my being mistaken, you infamous, criminal man, I remember how, on account of it, a question occurred to me at once, just when I was thanking you and pressing your hand. 
(For I know some benevolent people are very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way.) 
He is a very spiteful man.... 
He at once wrote a note to my mother and informed her that I had given away all my money, not to Katerina Ivanovna, but to Sofya Semyonovna, and referred in a most contemptible way to the... character of Sofya Semyonovna, that is, hinted at the character of my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna. 
Yes, allow me to pass!" 
"I told you myself today that I was going, when you tried to keep me; now I will simply add that you are a fool. 
But the battle was too unequal: the landlady waved her away like a feather. 
Polenka with the two little ones in her arms crouched, terrified, on the trunk in the corner of the room, where she waited trembling for her mother to come back. 
And he set off in the direction of Sonia's lodgings. 
Four RASKOLNIKOV had been a vigorous and active champion of Sonia against Luzhin, although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own heart. 
He was agitated too, especially at some moments, by the thought of his approaching interview with Sonia: he had to tell her who had killed Lizaveta. He knew the terrible suffering it would be to him and, as it were, brushed away the thought of it. 
"We must talk about something, you know. 
"But I can't know the Divine Providence.... And why do you ask what can't be answered? 
"You are leading up to something again.... 
Five minutes passed. 
Even his voice was suddenly weak. "I told you yesterday that I was not coming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing I've said is to ask forgiveness.... 
This was not at all, not at all the way he had intended to "tell" and he did not understand what was happening to him now. 
Listen, Sonia." He suddenly smiled, a pale helpless smile for two seconds. "You remember what I meant to tell you yesterday?" 
"I know." 
"He... did not mean to kill that Lizaveta... he... killed her accidentally.... 
"Nno..." whispered Sonia. 
It was not at all, not at all like this he had thought of telling her, but this is how it happened. 
In his changed tone she seemed to hear the murderer speaking. 
Where am I?" she said in complete bewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself. 
Don't worry yourself! 
That money was mine my own." 
They are all there now....." 
The thought flashed through Sonia's mind, wasn't he mad? But she dismissed it at once. "No, it was something else." 
You must believe that! 
"Not to steal and not to murder, don't be anxious," he smiled bitterly. 
Because I couldn't bear my burden and have come to throw it on another: you suffer too, and I shall feel better! 
"Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It may explain a great deal. 
"Ach, we are so different," he cried again, "we are not alike. 
And why, why did I come? 
"It was like this: I asked myself one day this question what if Napoleon, for instance, had happened to be in my place, and if he had not had Toulon nor Egypt nor the passage of Mont Blanc to begin his career with, but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things, there had simply been some ridiculous old hag, a pawnbroker, who had to be murdered too to get money from her trunk (for his career, you understand). Well, would he have brought himself to that, if there had been no other means? 
Of course that's all nonsense, it's almost all talk! 
I was a student, but I couldn't keep myself at the university and was forced for a time to leave it. 
"As though that could be the truth! 
I haven't talked to anyone for so long, Sonia.... 
I preferred lying still and thinking. 
No, that's not it! 
I wanted to have the daring... and I killed her. 
It wasn't to help my mother I did the murder that's nonsense I didn't do the murder to gain wealth and power and to become a benefactor of mankind. 
I wanted to find out something else; it was something else led me on. I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse like everybody else or a man. 
Have the right to kill?" 
I will tell you some day how I went! 
Will you go, will you go?" she asked him, trembling all over, snatching his two hands, squeezing them tight in hers and gazing at him with eyes full of fire. 
They are knaves and scoundrels, Sonia! 
I shall make a struggle for it and they won't do anything to me. 
Yes, it was a strange and awful sensation! 
He did not at first understand the question. 
"At least it seems so. 
It's beyond anything!" 
They say that in consumption, the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain; it's a pity I know nothing of medicine. 
"Excuse me, excuse me; of course it would be rather difficult for Katerina Ivanovna to understand, but do you know that in Paris they have been conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing the insane, simply by logical argument? 
One professor there, a scientific man of standing, lately dead, believed in the possibility of such treatment. 
Why had he come back here? 
From the yard came a loud continuous knocking; some one seemed to be hammering... 
He went to the window, rose on tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of absorbed attention. 
The boy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a Turk. There had been no costume for Lida; she simply had a red knitted cap, or rather a night cap that had belonged to Marmeladov, decorated with a broken piece of white ostrich feather, which had been Katerina Ivanovna's grandmother's and had been preserved as a family possession. 
"No, Rodion Romanovitch, that dream is over! 
You might sing 'Marlborough s'en vaten guerre,' for that's quite a child's song and is sung as a lullaby in all the aristocratic houses. 
We have only just run away from one of them. 
"We are going to the Nevsky.... Sonia, Sonia! 
What's the matter with you all? 
"Pass on! 
Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida, who were trembling and weeping. 
They sat her up on the bed, supporting her on both sides. 
"You've brought them, Polenka? 
Tap with your heels, be a graceful child! 
In the heat of midday in the vale of Dagestan. 
"Enough! 
So tell Avdotya Romanovna that that is how I am spending her ten thousand." 
One A STRANGE period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though a fog had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there was no escape. 
But although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness, Raskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it. 
They began quietly, slowly and mournfully singing the service. 
But although he had almost always been by himself of late, he had never been able to feel alone. 
"As far as I am concerned, you may all go to hell, but from what I see, it's clear to me that I can't make head or tail of it; please don't think I've come to ask you questions. 
So that's all nonsense and you haven't got a girl; the most likely thing is that you are mad. 
"You are going in for a drinking bout." 
"I told her you were a very good, honest, and industrious man. 
Of course, if it's all a secret, never mind.... But I... 
Razumihin stood lost in thought and excitement, making a silent conclusion. "He's a political conspirator! 
"She got a letter?" Raskolnikov asked thoughtfully. 
There was a time, brother, when I... Never mind, goodbye. 
Well, I heard it from Porfiry, among others... 
And how else can all this tangle be explained? 
There's something in that, too, perhaps. 
He might still have a struggle to come with Svidrigailov. 
The scene in the corridor under the lamp had produced its effect then. 
But no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled upon Porfiry himself in the passage. 
"You didn't expect a visitor, Rodion Romanovitch," Porfiry explained, laughing. 
Two "AH THESE cigarettes!" 
You know I am a coward, I went lately to Dr. B__n; he always gives at least half an hour to each patient. 
He positively laughed looking at me; he sounded me: 'Tobacco's bad for you,' he said, 'your lungs are affected.' But how am I to give it up? 
"I came into this very room. I was passing by, just as I did today, and I thought I'd return your call. 
For if a man is guilty, you must be able to get something substantial out of him; one may reckon upon most surprising results indeed. 
I was reckoning on your temperament, Rodion Romanovitch, on your temperament above all things! 
"Indeed I could scarcely attempt it. 
I believe there is no need to go into that either. 
I happened, too, to hear of the scene at the office, from a man who described it capitally, unconsciously reproducing the scene with great vividness. 
I jeered at you at the time, but that was only to lead you on. 
Well, I ask you, after that as a preliminary, how could I help being carried away by what followed? Oh, dear, I am not saying anything, I am not making any statement now. 
It was not malicious, I assure you, hehe! 
I saw it all plain as daylight, but if I hadn't expected you so specially, I should not have noticed anything in your laughter. 
I was bothered! 'No, I'd better get hold of some little fact' I said. 
No, thought I, morgen fruh. 
"Mr. Razumihin!" cried Porfiry Petrovitch, seeming glad of a question from Raskolnikov, who had till then, been silent. 
He sings and dances, he tells stories, they say, so that people come from other villages to hear him. 
"Well, he was frightened, he tried to hang himself! 
Well, in prison, it seems, he remembered the venerable elder, the Bible, too, made its appearance again. 
If they suffer at the hands of the authorities, so much the better. 
All that had been said before had sounded so like a recantation that these words were too great a shock. Raskolnikov shuddered as though he had been stabbed. 
Raskolnikov put his elbow on the table and passed his fingers through his hair. 
Suddenly Raskolnikov looked scornfully at Porfiry. 
I have a little fact even then, providence sent it me." 
Perhaps, too, even now I am hiding something from you? 
Raskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him. 
You made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke down and turned out to be not at all original! 
Be the sun and all will see you. 
I bet you're imagining that I am trying to get round you by flattery. 
But you've ceased to believe in your theory already, what will you run away with? 
It would be hateful and difficult for you, and what you need more than anything in life is a definite position, an atmosphere to suit you. 
And what sort of atmosphere would you have? If you ran away, you'd come back to yourself. 
And if I put you in prison, say you've been there a month, or two, or three remember my word, you'll confess of yourself and perhaps to your own surprise. 
You don't believe my words now, but you'll come to it of yourself. 
Though it would be a good thing to freshen the air." 
Another, much more important anxiety tormented him it concerned himself, but in a different, more vital way. 
Their very evildoing could not be of the same kind. 
Such stories were told about him. 
This morning Dounia had received a letter. 
From whom could she get letters in Petersburg? 
He found himself in X. Prospect, thirty or forty paces from the Hay Market, through which he had come. 
He found Svidrigailov in a tiny back room, adjoining the saloon in which merchants, clerks and numbers of people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the desperate bawling of a chorus of singers. 
"As you like, I didn't mean it for you. 
"I don't remember," answered Raskolnikov with surprise. 
This is a town of crazy people. 
If only we had scientific men, doctors, lawyers and philosophers might make most valuable investigations in Petersburg each in his own line. 
Some one may be watching you besides me, and it won't do you any good. 
It was a strange face, like a mask; white and red, with bright red lips, with a flaxen beard, and still thick flaxen hair. 
"Why in such haste?" asked Svidrigailov, looking at him curiously. 
The game isn't worth the candle and I wasn't intending to talk to you about anything special." 
"What did you want me, for, then? 
You see in what a tavern I spend all my time and it's my enjoyment, that's to say it's no great enjoyment, but one must sit somewhere; that poor Katia now you saw her?... 
If only I'd been something, a landowner, a father, a cavalry officer, a photographer, a journalist... 
A cardsharper not a gambler." 
"Didn't you get thrashed sometimes?" 
You seem to find something wrong in my speaking like that about women?" 
Oh, that's what you are after! 
"Oh, that's what you think, is it? 
"Please don't speak of it," he added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he had shown in all the previous conversation. His face quite changed. 
I have not much time, and can't stay long with you, it's a pity! 
No, that's not what I want to talk of." 
I am awfully fond of him." 
Raskolnikov had begun getting up. He felt oppressed and stifled and, as it were, ill at ease at having come here. 
I saw the danger at the first glance and what do you think, I resolved not to look at her even. 
And if once a girl's heart is moved to pity, it's more dangerous than anything. 
I, of course, threw it all on my destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and finally resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the female heart, a weapon which never fails one. 
I can never remember without laughter how I once seduced a lady who was devoted to her husband, her children, and her principles. 
There I acted stupidly again. I fell to jeering in the coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me; Parasha came on to the scene again, and not she alone; in fact there was a tremendous todo. 
I assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams; the very rustle of her dress was more than I could stand at last. 
It was essential, indeed, to be reconciled, but by then it was impossible. 
Of course I should have vowed eternal love, rapture, and so on. 
"Why, you are dropping them even now. 
Afraid of you? 
He snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it without ceremony out of the window. 
Philip brought the water. 
"But I can answer you in one word and annihilate all your suspicions. 
But I must tell you, for it's an interesting story, my marriage, in its own way. 
What if I am fifty and she is not sixteen? 
Though... though you had your own reasons.... 
My offer was accepted with enthusiasm as an honour and we are still friendly.... 
He became very suspicious of Svidrigailov and resolved to follow him. 
That's why Sofya Semyonovna has been invited to call today at the X. Hotel where the lady is staying for the time." 
Lay them all aside. 
Raskolnikov's judgment was uttered too lightly and hastily: there was something about Svidrigailov which gave him a certain original, even a mysterious character. 
Excuse my putting things so coarsely. 
Svidrigailov's lips were twisted in a condescending smile; but he was in no smiling mood. 
His heart was throbbing and he could scarcely breathe. 
"Though I know that you are not a man... of honour, I am not in the least afraid of you. 
Lead the way," she said with apparent composure, but her face was very pale. 
How unfortunate! 
If Sofya Semyonovna does not come back in ten minutes, I will send her to you, today if you like. 
This is my flat. 
Is he like that?" 
"Ah, Avdotya Romanovna, everything is in a muddle now; not that it was ever in very good order. 
But it's a misfortune to be broad without a special genius. 
I read that article of his about men to whom all is permitted. 
She was to have been back at once, but if not, then she will not be in till quite late." 
And as for the murder, he will do all sorts of good deeds yet, to atone for it. 
"We couldn't be shouting all over the flat on such a subject. 
He can still be saved. 
I asked you to come in order to discuss it alone with you and to consider it thoroughly. 
"It all depends on you, on you, on you alone," he begin with glowing eyes, almost in a whisper and hardly able to utter the words for emotion. 
Tell me, 'do that,' and I'll do it. 
I will do the impossible. 
So that even if you do sacrifice your brother, you could prove nothing. It is very difficult to prove an assault, Avdotya Romanovna." 
Suddenly she pulled out of her pocket a revolver, cocked it and laid it in her hand on the table. 
"It's not your revolver, it belonged to Marfa Petrovna, whom you killed, wretch! 
She was frantic. 
"That's a lie," there was a flash of fury in Dounia's eyes, "that's a lie and a libel!" 
Her lower lip was white and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire. 
The bullet grazed his hair and flew into the wall behind. 
"I swear I'll shoot again. 
He stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing at her with wild determination, with feverishly passionate, stubborn, set eyes. 
Dounia saw that he would sooner die than let her go. 
"She's dropped it!" said Svidrigailov with surprise, and he drew a deep breath. 
He took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table behind him, without turning or looking at Dounia. 
Drenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, opened the bureau, took out all his money and tore up two or three papers. 
She was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were with her. She was giving them tea. 
I know what she said to you, you need not tell me." 
(Sonia looked wildly at him, and started.) 
He began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black waters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry. 
He had noticed passing through this street lately that there was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairly large. and its name he remembered was something like Adrianople. 
The ragged fellow looked inquiringly. 
The walls looked as though they were made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty that the pattern was indistinguishable, though the general colour yellow could still be made out. 
He listened: some one was upbraiding and almost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice. 
One of them, a very curlyheaded man with a red inflamed face, was standing in the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide apart to preserve his balance, and smiting himself on the breast. He reproached the other with being a beggar, with having no standing whatever. He declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn him out when he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it all. 
He felt a longing to fix his imagination on something. "It must be a garden under the window," he thought. "There's a sound of trees. How I dislike the sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark! 
This reminded him of the bridge over the Little Neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there. 
"I never have liked water," he thought, "even in a landscape," and he suddenly smiled again at a strange idea: "Surely now all these questions of taste and comfort ought not to matter, but I've become more particular, like an animal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion. 
He may be a successful rogue in time when he's got over his nonsense. 
And the promises I made her just now, too Damnation! 
He recalled how at that instant he felt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a pang at his heart... 
He shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet. 
He got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the window. 
It will be light in an hour! 
He bent down with the candle and saw a little girl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her clothes as wet as a soaking houseflannel. 
Then he sank into dreary musing again. 
There was a thick mist outside and he could see nothing. 
He had overslept himself! 
There was not a cabman or a passerby in the street. 
The bright yellow, wooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected with their closed shutters. 
It will be in the presence of an official witness anyway...." 
"To America." 
Raskolnikov walked with lagging steps, as though still hesitating whether to go or not. 
Learned people are always like that. He may have some new ideas in his head just now; he is thinking them over and I worry him and upset him. 
It lasted only a moment. 
He recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding months. 
My goodness, why am I sitting here?" she cried, jumping up. 
I haven't come for that. 
I shall never cease to love you.... 
Pulcheria Alexandrovna embraced him in silence, pressing him to her bosom and weeping gently. 
"Goodbye, mother." 
When your father was living and we were poor, you comforted us simply by being with us and when I buried your father, how often we wept together at his grave and embraced, as now. 
That was just what we were afraid of, Sofya Semyonovna and I. Then you still have faith in life? 
"Surely you haven't done that?" 
The fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence. 
"Everything, everything, and am I prepared for it? 
They say it is necessary for me to suffer! What's the object of these senseless sufferings? shall I know any better what they are for, when I am crushed by hardships and idiocy, and weak as an old man after twenty years' penal servitude? 
Eight WHEN HE went into Sonia's room, it was already getting dark. 
Sonia was standing in dejection, looking intently out of the window, but from it she could see nothing but the unwhitewashed blank wall of the next house. 
"You see, Sonia, I've decided that it will be better so. 
Well, now I am going to prison and you'll have your wish. 
Sonia took up her shawl and put it over her head. 
But still he went. 
At the same instant, another thought dawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to strike him then. 
No, I wanted her tears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart ached! 
I am becoming a baby, I am showing off to myself; why am I ashamed? 
There's a peasant woman with a baby, begging. 
Here, here... take it, my good woman!" 
He would have given anything in the world to be alone; but he knew himself that he would not have remained alone for a moment. 
He knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down to the earth, and kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture. 
It wrung his heart... but he was just reaching the fatal place. 
He went into the yard fairly resolutely. 
Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was settling himself at a bureau to write. 
Zametov was not there, nor, of course, Nikodim Fomitch. 
He had just come in from the third room. 
I was even meaning to come and apologise to you, but thought maybe you'd... 
Bigotry and fanaticism! 
"Midwives is my name for them. 
Only this morning we heard about a gentleman who had just come to town. 
"Excuse my troubling you...." 
He fancied that a porter pushed past him on his way upstairs to the police office, that a dog in the lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a rollingpin at it and shouted. 
There was a look of poignant agony, of despair, in her face. 
Raskolnikov dropped on to a chair, but he kept his eyes fixed on the face of Ilya Petrovitch which expressed unpleasant surprise. 
All this was almost coarse.... 
Razumihin somehow discovered and proved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting him for six months, and when this student died, leaving a decrepit old father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year, Raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral when he died. 
Raskolnikov's landlady bore witness, too, that when they had lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskolnikov had rescued two little children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so. 
At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov's mother fell ill. Dounia and Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the trial. Razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg, so as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time to see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible. 
Pulcheria Alexandrovna's illness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial derangement of her intellect. 
She assured Razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman, that his article and brilliant literary talent proved it. 
She did not, for instance, complain of getting no letters from him, though in previous years she had only lived on the hope of letters from her beloved Rodya. 
Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive her and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely silent on certain points; but it became more and more evident that the poor mother suspected something terrible. 
Five months after Raskolnikov's confession, he was sentenced. 
Razumihin and Sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible. 
Two months later Dounia was married to Razumihin. 
For a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his mother's death, though a regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached Siberia. 
At first they found Sonia's letters dry and unsatisfactory, but later on they came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better, for from these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate brother's life. 
Sonia was afraid of him, how could he be ashamed before her? 
Oh, how happy he would have been if he could have blamed himself! He could have borne anything then, even shame and disgrace. 
"Why does my action strike them as so horrible?" he said to himself. 
What terrible agonies and privations some of them, the tramps for instance, had endured! 
He felt and knew the reasons of his isolation, but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons were so deep and strong. 
He saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than the Poles. 
A quarrel broke out one day, he did not know how. All fell on him at once in a fury. 
They even admired her gait and turned round to watch her walking; they admired her too for being so little, and, in fact, did not know what to admire her most for. 
The alarm bell was ringing all day long in the towns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned and who was summoning them no one knew. 
He was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her; he soon learnt that her illness was not dangerous. 
Again it was a warm bright day. 
In the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black specks, the nomads' tents. 
Everything, even his crime, his sentence and imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an external, strange fact with which he had no concern. 
But he could not think for long together of anything that evening, and he could not have analysed anything consciously; he was simply feeling. 
Till now he had not opened it. 
But she was so happy and so unexpectedly happy that she was almost frightened of her happiness. 
"Harry," said Hagrid, clapping a massive hand on his shoulder, so that Harry's knees buckled under its weight, "I'd've bin worried before I saw yeh take on tha Horntail, but I know now yeh can do anythin' yeh set yer mind ter. 
Got yer clue worked out, haven' yeh?" 
Yeh're goin' ter win, Harry n Harry just couldn't bring himself to wipe the happy, confident smile off Hagrid's face. 
Harry s heart gave a huge leap every time he saw the word "water" on a page, but more often than not it was merely "Take two pints of water, half a pound of shredded mandrake leaves, and a newt..." 
He was exhausted. 
"Be a talking point, wouldn't it?" 
Staggering under the weight of as many books as he could carry, Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room, pulled a table into a corner, and continued to search. 
By ten to midnight, he was alone in the room with Crookshanks. 
You can't do it. 
Wand tip alight, he crept along the bookshelves, pulling down more booksbooks of hexes and charms, books on merpeople and water monsters, books on famous witches and wizards, on magical inventions, on anything at all that might include one passing reference to underwater survival. 
He was still in the library; the Invisibility Cloak had slipped off his head as he'd slept, and the side of his face was stuck to the pages of Where There's a Wand, There's a Way. 
"The task's about to start!" 
He twisted around and looked at his bare feetthey had become elongated and the toes were webbed too: It looked as though he had sprouted flippers. 
Harry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow, a small, horned water demon, poking out of the weed, its long fingers clutched tightly around Harry's leg, its pointed fangs baredHarry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand. 
He knew he must be even deeper in the lake now, but nothing was moving but the rippling weed. 
He whipped around and saw Moaning Myrtle floating hazily in front of him, gazing at him through her thick, pearly glasses. 
Moaning Myrtle actually giggled. 
But then the merpeople around him pointed excitedly over his head. 
Feeling enormously relieved, Harry watched Cedric pull a knife out of his pocket and cut Cho free. 
"Get out of the way!" 
Harry darted forward and began to hack at the ropes binding the small girl to the statue, and at last she was free. 
He could see them swirling around him with ease, watching him struggle through the water.... 
Would they pull him back down to the depths when the time was up? 
He was drawing breath with extreme difficulty. 
He could feel pain on the sides of his neck again ... he was becoming very aware of how wet the water was in his mouth ... yet the darkness was definitely thinning now... he could see daylight above him.... 
Then he spotted Fleur's sister. 
"What did you bring her for?" 
"The song said" "It was only to make sure you got back inside the time limit!" said Ron. 
"She's fine!" Harry tried to tell her, but he was so exhausted he could hardly talk, let alone shout. 
Harry had the impression that Krum was drawing her attention back onto himself; perhaps to remind her that he had just rescued her from the lake, but Hermione brushed away the beetle impatiently and said, "You're well outside the time limit, though, Harry.... 
Dumbledore was crouching at the water's edge, deep in conversation with what seemed to be the chief merperson, a particularly wild and ferociouslooking female. 
"You saved 'er," she said breathlessly. 
"Even though she was not your 'ostage." 
We award her twentyfive points." 
Harrys heart sank. 
"Harry Potter used gillyweed to great effect," Bagman continued. 
"He returned last, and well outside the time limit of an hour. 
However, the Merchieftainess informs us that Mr. Potter was first to reach the hostages, and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety, not merely his own." 
Fleur was clapping very hard too, but Krum didn't look happy at all. 
"The third and final task will take place at dusk on the twentyfourth of June," continued Bagman. 
Thank you all for your support of the champions." 
Ron's ears went red, and thereafter, he reverted to the bewitched sleep version of events. 
"Made it so far, though, hasn't he?" said Ron. 
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with Pansy Parkinson's gang of Slytherin girls. 
Harry saw that Pansy had a magazine in her handsWitch Weekly. 
"Scarlet woman?" she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at Ron. 
She looked over at the Slytherins, who were all watching her and Harry closely across the room to see if they had been upset by the article. 
"Well, I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were okay to" "Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is. Miss Granger," said an icy voice right behind them, and all three of them jumped, "I must ask you not to discuss it in my class. 
His hands were shaking slightly out of anger, but he kept his eyes down, as though he couldn't hear what Snape was saying to him. 
Harry stared back at Snape, determined not to blink or to look guilty. 
Hermione had taken the boomslang skin back in their second yearthey had needed it for the Polyjuice Potionand while Snape had suspected Harry at the time, he had never been able to prove it. 
"I don't know what you're talking about," Harry lied coldly. 
"I'll bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go in there." 
He tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron too, and wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out of Moody s book and start drinking only from a private hip flask. 
"We need to talk," said Karkaroff abruptly when he had reached Snape. 
Karkaroff looked extremely worried, and Snape looked angry. 
He seemed intent on preventing Snape from slipping away at the end of class. 
It's never been this clear, never since" "Put it away!" snarled Snape, his black eyes sweeping the classroom. 
Karkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the dungeon. 
Then, at half past one, they made their way up the High Street, past Dervish and Banges, and out toward the edge of the village. 
The winding lane was leading them out into the wild countryside around Hogsmeade. 
The cottages were fewer here, and their gardens larger; they were walking toward the foot of the mountain in whose shadow Hogsmeade lay. 
His black hair was longer than it had been when he had appeared in the fire, and it was untidy and matted once more. 
"Chicken!" he said hoarsely after removing the old Daily Prophets from his mouth and throwing them down onto the cave floor. 
Harry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and bread. 
"Thanks," said Sirius, opening it, grabbing a drumstick, sitting down on the cave floor, and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth. 
Ministry refuses to confirm rumors of critical illness.... 
"But he can't be that ill if he managed to get up here...." 
She was stroking Buckbeak, who was crunching up Sirius's chicken bones. 
Then he said, "Harry, did you check your pockets for your wand after you'd left the Top Box?" 
Harry thought hard. 
"We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared," Hermione told Sirius. 
"How do you know?" Hermione shot back. 
"How do you know where he Disapparated to?" 
"All these absences of Barty Crouch's ... he goes to the trouble of making sure his houseelf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup, but doesn't bother to turn up and watch. 
"That's what my dad said at the World Cup," said Ron, with a trace of irritation in his voice. 
They lose the will to live. 
That boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived. 
She died herself, apparently, shortly afterward. 
The conclusion was that his father never cared much for him. 
"If you ask me, he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more Death Eater." 
"So you think Snape could be up to something, then?" asked Harry, but Hermione broke in. 
"Ever since I found out Snape was teaching here, I've wondered why Dumbledore hired him. 
The Lestrangesthey're a married couplethey're in Azkaban. 
He ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair, then shrugged again. 
Finally, Sirius looked up at Ron. 
"It's half past three," said Hermione. 
"You'd better get back to school," Sirius said, getting to his feet. 
He handed Harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat Buckbeak goodbye. 
Yeah, Percy loves rules. 
As they watched her, she gave an enormous hiccup. 
"Winky is pining, Harry Potter," Dobby whispered sadly. 
"Master cannothicmanagehicall by himself...." 
"Master ishictrusting Winky withhicthe most importanthicthe most secret..." 
"We has your extra food!" squeaked an elf at Harry's elbow, and he shoved a large ham, a dozen cakes, and some fruit into Harry's arms. 
Hagrid leaned upon his spade, but did not seem keen to prolong their talk, because Madame Maxime returned to the carriage shortly afterward. 
"They're all like it!" said Hermione desperately, opening one letter after another. 
As Harry and Ron left the greenhouse for their Care of Magical Creatures class, they saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle descending the stone steps of the castle. 
Harry ignored her; he didn't want to give her the satisfaction of knowing how much trouble the Witch Weekly article had caused. 
"She had to go to the hospital wing," said Ron. 
It was easily the most fun they had ever had in Care of Magical Creatures. 
"No," said Ron shortly. 
"I don't blame Fred and George for trying to make some extra money. 
"I hate that Skeeter woman!" she burst out savagely. 
People got bored with that stuff she wrote about me last time "I want to know how she's listening into private conversations when she's supposed to be banned from the grounds!" said Hermione angrily. 
"You know it by heart, we can just ask you." 
"Don't you want to see what Percy's written?" Harry asked her hastily. 
No, I haven't actually seen him, but I think I can be trusted to know my own superior's handwriting. 
So at half past eight that night. Harry left Ron and Hermione in Gryffindor Tower and went downstairs. 
Bagman grinned at Harry and Cedric. 
Bagman looked slightly perturbed. 
When at last they had reached a quiet stretch of ground a short way from the Beauxbatons horses' paddock, Krum stopped in the shade of the trees and turned to face Harry. 
She's not my girlfriend and she never has been. 
Harry looked around at Krum, who had followed him into the trees, and was looking down at Crouch in alarm. 
"Just stay with him," said Harry, starting to get up, but his movement seemed to trigger another abrupt change in Mr. Crouch, who seized him hard around the knees and pulled Harry back to the ground. 
They were deserted; Bagman, Cedric, and Fleur had disappeared. 
But nothing at Hogwarts had ever moved just because he shouted at it; he knew it was no good. 
No one answered. 
"Stunned," he said softly. 
His halfmoon glasses glittered in the wandlight as he peered around at the surrounding trees. 
"Damn leg," he said furiously. 
"What's going on?" 
The Triwizard judge?" 
I smell doubledealing and corruption in this whole affair, and you, Dumbledore, you, with your talk of closer international wizarding links, of rebuilding old ties, of forgetting old differenceshere's what I think of you!" 
Breathing heavily, Hagrid gave Karkaroff a glowering look. 
It comes down to this," said Hermione, rubbing her forehead. "Either Mr. Crouch attacked Viktor, or somebody else attacked both of them when Viktor wasn't looking." 
"He seemed really weakI don't reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything." 
"Okay... hows this for a theory," said Ron excitedly. 
"I've told you, he wasn't making much sense," said Harry. 
He mentioned his son." 
"He was having real trouble stringing two words together, but that was when he seemed to know where he was, and know what he wanted to do. 
He was holding a sealed envelope in his hands. 
Then Fred said abruptly, "I've told you before, Ron, keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is. 
"If it was something that serious, they'd tell someone. 
Hermione was looking uncomfortable now. 
"Yes, but... they wouldn't do anything against the law to get gold." 
"Do you think it's too early to go and see Professor Moody?" Hermione said as they went down the spiral staircase. 
"Took a leaf out of your book, Potter. 
"Well, he wasn't invisible," said Harry. 
He yawned widely, so that his scars stretched, and his lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing teeth. 
The Ministry'll be looking for him now, Dumbledore's notified them. 
He hadn't given the maze a single thought since he'd left it with Krum the previous night. 
"Should be right up your street, this one," said Moody, looking up at Harry and scratching his scarred and stubbly chin. 
Harrywhat do you think you are playing at, walking off into the forest with Viktor Krum? 
There's nothing you can do about Crouch. 
I'm waiting for your letter giving me your word you won't stray outofbounds again. 
"Look," said Harry impatiently, "let's say Sirius is right, and someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch. 
"But if you die during a task" "They didn't care about attacking Krum, did they?" said Harry. 
"Well, you keep missing the cushions, don't you!" said Hermione impatiently, rearranging the pile of cushions they had used for the Banishing Spell, which Flitwick had left in a cabinet. 
The bell rang. 
They hastily shoved the cushions back into Flitwicks cupboard and slipped out of the classroom. 
If you will all look this way, I will dim the lights...." 
Harry watched lazily as Professor Trelawney began to point out the fascinating angle Mars was making to Neptune. 
"You are in luck, Wormtail," said a cold, highpitched voice from the depths of the chair in which the owl had landed. 
Your blunder has not ruined everything. 
The tip of a wand emerged from around the back of the chair. 
"My dear, you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room!" said Professor Trelawney. 
"See you later," Harry muttered to Ron, and he picked up his bag and headed for the trapdoor, ignoring Professor Trelawney, who was wearing an expression of great frustration, as though she had just been denied a real treat. 
When Harry reached the bottom of her stepladder, however, he did not set off for the hospital wing. 
Sirius had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again, and Harry was going to follow his advice: He was going straight to Dumbledore's office. 
He blinked, looked around, realized what he had done, and retraced his steps, stopping in front of it. 
ErLicorice Wand. 
Harry kicked it, achieving nothing but an excruciating pain in his big toe. 
"Dumbledore, come!" said Fudge angrily. 
They don't all turn out harmlessif, indeed, you can call Hagrid harmless, with that monster fixation he's got" "I no more suspect Madame Maxime than Hagrid," said Dumbledore, just as calmly. 
"How are you?" 
"Our examination of the grounds will not take long." 
It was a bright, whitish silver, and it was moving ceaselessly; the surface of it became ruffled like water beneath wind, and then, like clouds, separated and swirled smoothly. 
It looked like light made liquidor like wind made solidHarry couldn't make up his mind. 
Chains encircled the arms of it, as though its occupants were usually tied to it. 
Dumbledore's office gave an almighty lurchHarry was thrown forward and pitched headfirst into the substance inside the basinBut his head did not hit the stone bottom. 
Like every other wizard on the benches, he was staring into the far corner of the room, where there was a door. 
Harry's insides went cold. 
The man between them looked as though he was about to faint, and Harry couldn't blame him ... he knew the dementors could not touch him inside a memory, but he remembered their power only too well. 
He was shaking. 
Even as Harry watched, the chains on the arms of the chair glowed suddenly gold and snaked their way up Karkaroff's arms, binding him there. 
MadEye Moody was sitting thereexcept that there was a very noticeable difference in his appearance. 
"You say you have names for us, Karkaroff," said Mr. Crouch. 
Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. 
The atmosphere seemed quite different: relaxed, even cheerful. 
The witches and wizards all around the walls were talking to one another, almost as though they were at some sort of sporting event. 
Harry looked around; Dumbledore was sitting beside him again, wearing different robes. 
Many of the witches and wizards around the walls began to clap. 
Bagman got to his feet and bowed, beaming. 
Harry saw the people in the crowd turn to look up at Mr. Crouch. 
He looked down upon the four in front of him, and there was pure hatred in his face. 
The crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for Bagman, their faces full of savage triumph. 
We alone tried to find him!" 
Crouch appeared not to have noticed. 
Harry started. 
There was an Albus Dumbledore sitting on his right, watching Crouch's son being dragged away by the dementorsand there was an Albus Dumbledore on his left, looking right at him. 
The stone basin was shimmering in the cabinet in front of him, and Albus Dumbledore was standing beside him. 
Harry did so, staring at the stone basin. The contents had returned to their original, silverywhite state, swirling and rippling beneath his gaze. 
"What is it?" Harry asked shakily. 
He was torturing Wormtail ... you know who Wormtail" "I do know," said Dumbledore promptly. 
Now, has your scar hurt at any other time this year, excepting the time it woke you up over the summer?" 
Every now and then, he placed his wand tip to his temple, removed another shining silver thought, and added it to the Pensieve. 
"His father, Frank, was an Auror just like Professor Moody. 
He and his wife were tortured for information about Voldemort's whereabouts after he lost his powers, as you heard." 
The Ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it. 
There were two more questions he was burning to ask ... but they concerned the guilt of living people.... 
"Er," he said, "Mr. Bagman ..." "... has never been accused of any Dark activity since," said Dumbledore calmly. 
But the Pensieve seemed to be asking his question for him. 
Harry looked into Dumbledore's light blue eyes, and the thing he really wanted to know spilled out of his mouth before he could stop it. 
Dumbledore held Harrys gaze for a few seconds, and then said, "That, Harry, is a matter between Professor Snape and myself." 
Harry knew that the interview was over; Dumbledore did not look angry, yet there was a finality in his tone that told Harry it was time to go. 
Dumbledore reckons YouKnowWho's getting stronger again as well?" Ron whispered. 
"And he trusts Snape?" Ron said. 
He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm, though. 
"He can't be," said Hermione, "I've told you, those sorts of things don't work around Hogwarts. 
Come on, Harry," she added briskly, turning away from the window and moving back into the middle of the room, "let's try that Shield Charm again." 
"It's about me, isn't it?" said Harry. 
"He might even be pretending," said one specialist. 
"Potter can speak Parseltongue," reveals Draco Malfoy, a Hogwarts fourth year. "There were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago, and most people thought Potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy. It was all hushed up, though. But he's made friends with werewolves and giants too. 
Some fear that Potter might resort to the Dark Arts in his desperation to win the tournament, the third task of which takes place this evening. 
"Yes," said Hermione breathlessly. 
Harry gaped after her. 
He said you were incredible against the Horntail." 
Fleur Delacour, Harry noticed, was eyeing Bill with great interest over her mother's shoulder. 
"Hello, Hermione," said Mrs. Weasley, much more stiffly than usual. 
As the enchanted ceiling overhead began to fade from blue to a dusky purple, Dumbledore rose to his feet at the staff table, and silence fell. 
Harry got up. 
They looked at each other. 
"See you," Harry said, and he took the left one, while Cedric took the right. 
Krum had entered the maze. 
His chosen path seemed completely deserted. 
The old feeling that he was being watched was upon him. 
Harry didn't know why, but the lack of obstacles was unnerving him. 
Cedric looked severely shaken. 
He shook his head and dived out of sight, along another path. 
Harry approached it cautiously, pointing the wand's beam at it. 
Did he dare move his foot? 
He paused at a junction of two paths and looked around for some sign of Fleur. 
There was no sign of red sparksdid that mean she had got herself out of trouble, or was she in such trouble that she couldn't reach her wand? 
The cup was somewhere close by, and it sounded as though Fleur was no longer in the running. 
And then Harry heard Krum's voice. 
Then, as he strode down a long, straight path, he saw movement once again, and his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary creature, one which he had only seen in picture form, in his Monster Book of Monsters. 
"No," she said, continuing to pace. 
Answer on your first guessI let you pass. 
Harry's stomach slipped several notches. 
"Could I have it again ... more slowly?" he asked tentatively. 
"A person in disguise," Harry muttered, staring at her, "who lies ... er ... that'd be aan impostor. 
"Spy ... er ... spy ... er ..." said Harry, pacing up and down. 
His wand was telling him he was bang on course; as long as he didn't meet anything too horrible, he might have a chance.... 
He had a choice of paths up ahead. 
Suddenly a dark figure hurtled out onto the path in front of him. 
Without pausing to think, he aimed high at the spider's underbelly, as he had done with the skrewt, and shouted "Stupefy!''just as Cedric yelled the same thing. 
But Cedric didn't move. 
"I was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously!" said Harry bitterly. 
Harry looked from Cedric to the cup. 
"Both of us," Harry said. 
"Where are we?" he said. 
Harry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at Cedric. 
But Wormtail, who had finished conjuring the ropes, did not reply; he was busy checking the tightness of the cords, his fingers trembling uncontrollably, rumbling over the knots. 
Harry couldn't make a sound, nor could he see where Wormtail had gone; he couldn't turn his head to see beyond the headstone; he could see only what was right in front of him. 
It seemed to be stirring fretfully. 
The thing Wormtail had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human child, except that Harry had never seen anything less like a child. 
And then Wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron; there was a hiss, and it vanished below the surface; Harry heard its frail body hit the bottom with a soft thud. 
And now Wormtail was whimpering. 
His voice broke into petrified sobs. "Fleshof the servantwwillingly givenyou willreviveyour master. " 
Wormtail, still panting with pain, rumbled in his pocket for a glass vial and held it to Harry's cut, so that a dribble of blood fell into it. 
"Oh Master ... thank you, Master ..." 
Voldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail's left arm; he forced the sleeve of Wormtail's robes up past his elbow, and Harry saw something upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattooa skull with a snake protruding from its mouththe image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark Mark. 
He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail's arm. 
The scar on Harry s forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl; Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail's mark, and Harry saw that it had turned jet black. 
"You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father," he hissed softly. 
Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave. 
All of them were hooded and masked. 
The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping. 
Thirteen long years ... 
I want thirteen years' repayment before I forgive you. 
"Lucius, my slippery friend," he whispered, halting before him. 
Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius.... 
You have disappointed me.... I expect more faithful service in the future." 
You are merciful, thank you...." 
Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he paused before others and spoke to them. 
Lord Voldemort will provide...." 
Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy's voice spoke from under the mask. 
Voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony. 
I could not touch the boy." 
I was not to be assured immortal life. 
One or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably, but Voldemort took no notice. 
For, hungry one night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me, he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food ... and who should he meet there, but one Bertha Jorkins, a witch from the Ministry of Magic. 
"Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort. 
But I knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more powerful than I had been when I had fallen. 
There was a split second, perhaps, when Harry might have considered running for it, but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave, as the Death Eaters closed ranks, forming a tighter circle around him and Voldemort, so that the gaps where the missing Death Eaters should have stood were filled. 
They glided away from the tombstone of Voldemort's father and then came to rest on a patch of ground that was clear and free of graves.... 
As the closest bead of light moved nearer to Harrys wand tip, the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame. 
Harry, both arms shaking now as he fought to keep his wand still, saw her drop to the ground and straighten up like the others, staring.... 
The smoky shadow of a tall man with untidy hair fell to the ground as Bertha had done, straightened up, and looked at him ... and Harry, his arms shaking madly now, looked back into the ghostly face of his father. 
Ten feet from Cedric, Harry dived behind a marble angel to avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit it. 
He had closed his eyes while the Portkey transported him, and he kept them closed now. 
"Harry, stay here" Girls were screaming, sobbing hysterically.... 
Across the lawn, past the lake and the Durmstrang ship, Harry heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping him walk. 
It was MadEye Moody. 
Along the corridor ... 
"Drink it... you'll feel better ... come on, now. Harry, I need to know exactly what happened...." 
He looked as white as Fudge had looked, and both eyes were fixed unblinkingly upon Harry's face. 
They returned?" 
"Loads of them ..." 
"No," said Moody slowly. 
I told you. 
It was fixed upon Harry. 
But I also had to contend with your stupidity. The second task ... that was when I was most afraid we would fail. 
I staged a loud conversation with Professor McGonagall about the hostages who had been taken, and whether Potter would think to use gillyweed. 
And your little elf friend ran straight to Snape's office and then hurried to find you..." 
But luckily, Dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility, and marked you high for it. 
"You had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze tonight, of course," said Moody. 
"The Dark Lord didn't manage to kill you. Potter, and he so wanted to," whispered Moody. 
There was no benign smile upon Dumbledore's face, no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles. 
"Come along ... hospital wing ..." 
He needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered tonight, and why," "Moody," Harry said. 
Dumbledore bent down over Moody's limp form and put a hand inside his robes. 
"Severus, please fetch me the strongest Truth Potion you possess, and then go down to the kitchens and bring up the houseelf called Winky. 
"The imposter has been cutting it off all year, see where it is uneven? 
Minutes passed in silence.... 
Suddenly, with a loud clunk, the wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew in its place; next moment, the magical eyeball had popped out of the man's face as a real eye replaced it; it rolled away across the floor and continued to swivel in every direction. 
He had seen him in Dumbledore's Pensieve, had watched him being led away from court by the dementors, trying to convince Mr. Crouch that he was innocent... but he was lined around the eyes now and looked much older.... 
But Crouch took another deep breath and continued in the same flat voice. 
"The dementors are blind. 
They sensed one healthy, one dying person entering Azkaban. 
"And what did your father do with you, when he had got you home?" said Dumbledore quietly. 
"Staged my mother's death. 
She pitied me. 
But Bertha Jorkins heard Winky talking to me. 
"Why is she coming to nose into my masters private business?" sobbed Winky. 
"She spent months persuading him. 
I had loved Quidditch. 
"So you took the wand," said Dumbledore, "and what did you do with it?" 
"Ministry wizards arrived. 
"He arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant Wormtail. 
Ensure he reached the Triwizard Cup. 
I took his leg and his eye. 
Then I packed up Moody's clothes and Dark detectors, put them in the trunk with Moody, and set off for Hogwarts. 
After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I had done. 
The map that had almost ruined everything." 
He was walking around the edge of the forest. 
"Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father. 
I went back to my father's body. 
Watched the map. 
He is returned to power and I will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards." 
"Minerva, could I ask you to stand guard here while I take Harry upstairs?" 
Tell him I will be in the hospital wing in half an hour's time if he needs me." 
"I want you to come up to my office first. Harry," he said quiedy as they headed up the passageway. 
In one swift moment, he had crossed the room. 
There was something comforting about his warm weight. 
He leaned forward toward Harry. 
Dumbledore walked around the desk and told Harry to stretch out his arm. 
His eyes gazed into Harry's and it was almost as though an invisible beam of understanding shot between them. 
This phoenix, in fact," he added, and he pointed at the scarletandgold bird, perching peacefully on Harry's knee. 
The most recent first... and then those which preceded it...." 
"He spoke to me," Harry said. 
"The ... the ghost Cedric, or whatever he was, spoke." 
Sirius's grip on Harry's shoulder was now so tight it was painful. 
He looked around at Sirius and saw that he had his face in his hands. 
His leg was repaired. 
You have shouldered a grown wizard's burden and found yourself equal to itand you have now given us all we have a right to expect. 
Harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight. 
She was very white. 
"Headmaster," said Madam Pomfrey, staring at the great black dog that was Sirius, "may I ask what?" 
HarryI will wait while you get into bed." 
Harry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to Dumbledore for asking the others not to question him. 
His wooden leg and magical eye were lying on the bedside table. 
Mrs. Weasley was on her feet. 
There were angry blotches of color in her cheeks, and a hands were balled into fists; she was trembling with fury."When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for tonight's events," said Snape, in a low voice; he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question. 
He insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle. 
"The moment thatthat thing entered the room," she screamed, pointing at Fudge, trembling all over, "it swooped down on Crouch andand" Harry felt a chill in his stomach as Professor McGonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened. 
"He was a raving lunatic! 
"As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you," said Dumbledore, "we heard Barty Crouch confess. 
Come now, come now ... certainly, Crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon YouKnowWho's ordersbut to take the word of a lunatic like that, Dumbledore ..." 
His hackles were raised, and he was baring his teeth at Fudge. 
"You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, on the word of a lunatic murderer, and a boy who ... well..." 
Fudge shot Harry another look, and Harry suddenly understood. 
Fudge reddened slightly, but a defiant and obstinate look came over his face. 
"Headaches? 
"Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is too late," said Dumbledore, "or Voldemort will persuade them, as he did before, that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom!" 
"Youyou cannot be serious!" Fudge gasped, shaking his head and retreating further from Dumbledore. 
Bill, Ron, and Hermione were staring at Fudge. 
Finally, he said, with a hint of a plea in his voice, "He can't be back, Dumbledore, he just can't be ..." 
"There," said Snape harshly. 
The Dark Mark. 
It is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago, when it burned black, but you can still see it. 
Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight? 
He stared, apparently repelled by the ugly mark on Snape's arm, then looked up at Dumbledore and whispered, "I don't know what you and your staff are playing at, Dumbledore, but I have heard enough. 
I will be in touch with you tomorrow, Dumbledore, to discuss the running of this school. 
Do what you can for her, and take her back to the kitchens. 
"He is here at my invitation," said Dumbledore, looking between them, "as are you, Severus. 
They let go extremely quickly. 
You are to alert Remus Lupin, Arabella Figg, Mundungus Fletcherthe old crowd. 
"Then good luck," said Dumbledore, and he watched, with a trace of apprehension on his face, as Snape swept wordlessly after Sirius. 
Harry slumped back against his pillows as Dumbledore disappeared. 
Hermione, Ron, and Mrs. Weasley were all looking at him. 
"You've got to take the rest of your potion. Harry," Mrs. Weasley said at last. 
It should've been Cedric's." 
They did not blame him for what had happened; on the contrary, both thanked him for returning Cedric's body to them. 
Harry seized the sack of gold on the bedside table. 
They used the one on Thursday afternoon to go down and visit Hagrid in his cabin. 
It was a bright and sunny day; Fang bounded out of the open door as they approached, barking and wagging his tail madly. 
When he had made tea and offered around a plate of doughy cookies, he leaned back in his chair and surveyed Harry closely through his beetleblack eyes. 
Migh' be able ter stop him before he gets a good hold. 
OlympeMadame Maxime ter youmight be comin' with me. 
The real MadEye Moody was at the staff table now, his wooden leg and his magical eye back in place. 
The Great Hall, which in any case had been less noisy than it usually was at the Leaving Feast, became very quiet. 
His death has affected you all, whether you knew him well or not. 
In the light of what has happenedof Lord Voldemorts returnsuch ties are more important than ever before." 
Fleur Delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. 
"It's very good already," said Ron in a strangled sort of voice. 
Fleur smiled at him; Hermione scowled. 
Even though I vos from Durmstrangwith Karkaroff," he added, scowling. 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione talked more fully and freely than they had all week as the train sped them southward. 
They wouldn't care that she was doing something illegal, as long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us and Hagrid." 
Smiling serenely, Hermione placed the beetle back inside her schoolbag. 
His hand gripped his wand under his robes. 
He jerked his head at Ron and Hermione. 
"Too late now. Potter! 
"You going to tell us, then?" he said to George. 
By next morning, it had gone!" 
"Butit must've been an accident, mustn't it?" said Hermione. 
"Yeah, that's what we thought, at first. 
"Right in one," said Fred. 
"FredGeorgewait a moment." 
"Take it," Harry repeated firmly. 
"Listen," said Harry firmly. 
"Look," he said flatly, "take it, or I'll hex you. 
There was no point worrying yet, he told himself, as he got into the back of the Dursleys' car. 
So sufferings may not penetrate your world, 
This book has been written to confront this impending danger. 
In a similar manner, to be free of the horror of "fascism," one must fight its ideological basis and the influences that aid it in its growth. 
God has ordered man to live in peace and security. 
War alone brings up to its highest tension all human energy and puts the stamp of nobility upon the peoples who have courage to meet it. 
Other countries, which were influenced by fascism or adopted it, "imported" the ideology from Europe. 
But, in the broadest sense, we can divide it into three fundamental periods: 
Christianity, which calls people to love, compassion, selfsacrifice, and humility, is the complete antithesis of fascism. 
Europeans believed the false gods they worshipped represented various forces or aspects of life, and most important were the gods of war, much like those who have appeared in just about every pagan society. 
The pagan world was a place where violence prevailed, where the use of brutality of every kind was encouraged, and where there was no consideration at all for ethics. 
Under the Spartan system, the state was very much more important than the individual. 
'The race of the guardians must be kept pure', says Plato (in defence of infanticide), when developing the racialist argument that we breed animals with great care while neglecting our own race, an argument which has been repeated ever since. 
Christianity carried to European society the basic ethical characteristics of the true religion revealed to man by the Prophet Jesus. 
This neopagan current became increasingly influential, and in the 19th century, surpassed Christianity and imposed itself on Europe. 
The vanguard of neopagan movement was those thinkers known as "humanists." 
The Jacobins, who led the bloody "terrorist" period of the French Revolution, were influenced by paganism, and nurtured a great hatred for Christianity. 
In addition, a new "religion of reason" was established, which was based on pagan symbols rather than Christianity. 
The first of these was that the universe had always existed and will continue to exist into eternity. The second was the idea that living things evolved from each other, an idea which had slowly begun to take shape in Thales' time. 
From the research he carried out in his eighthectare botanical garden, he developed the ideas that would later go on to shape Darwinism, collected together in his books The Temple of Nature and Zoonomia. 
The myth of evolution, a legacy of Sumerian and Greek paganism, was introduced into the Western agenda with Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, published in 1859. 
In this work, as in The Descent of Man, he discussed certain pagan concepts that had disappeared in Europe under Christianity, and gave them "justification" under the guise of science. 
Crook writes: 
Nietzsche hated divine religions, such as Christianity, Islam and Judaism, but was fascinated by the pagan culture of ancient Greece. 
She stood out as an avowed supporter of Nazi ideology in Hitler's Germany, and announced that her brother's model of the "Superman" had been brought to life by Hitler.16 
They will have a painful punishment. 
They will have a humiliating punishment. 
After Great Britain, eugenics began to attract supporters in the United States. 
According to this evolutionary theory, Haeckel was claiming that embryonic development repeats "evolutionary history." 
Haeckel was a charlatan who used falsified evidence to make Darwinism scientifically acceptable. 
Hitler was influenced by these views of Rosenberg, although he refrained from implementing the socalled German religion because he was afraid of what society's reaction might be.31 
"Mother Earth" or "Father Sky" were called on at wedding ceremonies. 
Who were these "intellectuals" who popularized Nietzschean fascism in Germany? 
There are numerous similarities between fascism in Europe, where the clearest examples of fascism were seen, and Latin America and Japan, where the movement also took root and flourished. 
Because the fundamental ideas on which fascism were based (in other words, racism, romantic nationalism, chauvinism and fantasy) could only be widely accepted by the uneducated, susceptible as they were to crude, facile slogans. 
Hitler came to power by similar methods. 
Throughout all this, of course, the Nazis frequently resorted to illegal methods, much like the Italian Fascist party. 
On January 30, 1933, Hitler was made chancellor. 
In this manner, the administrative and lawmaking power came into Hitler's hands. 
In addition to brute force, Hitler also made use of various types of antidemocratic methods. 
Olympia was one of the old centers of ancient Greek pagan culture. 
Students from German universities, which had previously been recognized as the best in the world, gathered in Berlin and other German cities, and burned books which contained "unGerman" ideas. 
Right from primary school, children were raised without any ethical values or human feeling, and in a way devoid of affection or compassion. 
The Hitler Youth grew steadily, and by 1935, 60 percent of youth were enrolled in it. 
This had a profound psychological effect on the public, who constantly felt themselves within the leader's power and under his control, and even, that he was always watching them. 
Thus Mussolini was able to satisfy his enormous ego, not even allowing his oldest friends to sit down, but keeping them on their feet for hours. 
This was produced in a number of ways. 
They present what appear to be sacred values to the people and encourage them in selfsacrifice for the sake of the state, to despise other nations or races, and even to torture and kill. 
The frequent repetition of written and shouted slogans, cries, martial music and salutes are a vital part of fascist ceremonies. 
Under fascism, a person's natural love for his people and country is turned into a dangerous sentimentality and a mindless loss of selfcontrol, whereby whole societies are driven to kill by exploiting these emotions. (see Romanticism: A Weapon of Satan, Harun Yahya) 
Fascism's False Sacred Values 
For instance, during Hitler's unsuccessful putsch in 1923, one of the swastika flags, wet from the blood of wounded Nazis, was turned into a sacred relic. 
This fictitious danger is fascism's most important propaganda weapon, by which a grievous menace is said to exist, and the fascist leader is portrayed as a "hero" who will save his people from it. 
It is this suspiciousness that lies behind Saddam Hussein's having his closest relatives killed on possibility of "betrayal." 
There is no art in it, there is no imagination. 
He is a professional killer, with no distractions. 
After questioning, 13 of these were taken out of the village by lorry and killed by the side of the road. 
Another disturbing aspect of fascism is that people living under such a regime are unable to develop their artistic talents, and that their scientific research fails to produce any productive results. 
The fascist soul is utterly debilitated and ignorant, and lacks all understanding, and considers art "unnecessary." 
Painters could only paint subjects that encouraged the spirit of war. 
As can be discerned from all that has been mentioned, the artistic talents and scientific endeavor of people living under fascist regimes are ultimately fruitless. 
For instance, Mussolini's statement to Maurice de Valeffe, a reporter for the French publication Journal, on Nov. 12, 1922, openly belittled women: 
The root of this prejudice among fascists towards women was, as in so many other matters, Darwinism. 
Fascists did not merely appropriate the idea of the inequality between the races from Darwinism, they also adopted the idea that men were superior to women. 
If two lists were made of the most eminent men and women in poetry, painting, sculpture, music (inclusive both of composition and performance), history, science, and philosophy, with halfadozen names under each subject, the two lists would not bear comparison. 
The evolutionist and materialist Carl Vogt, a contemporary of Darwin and a Geneva scholar of the mid nineteenth century, also held disparaging views regarding women. 
This inferiority is so obvious that no one can contest it for a moment; only its degree is worth discussion.... 
They see them as an inferior and backward species, and both despise them, as well as employing discriminatory and oppressive methods against them. 
God has commanded in the Koran that women should be cherished, respected, and protected. 
The interesting thing is that the alliance of the fascist states was set up between groups who each saw themselves as the "superior race." 
We shall consider the answer to that question in this chapter. 
James Joll, who spent many years as a professor of history at universities such as Oxford, Stanford, and Harvard, explained the relationship between Darwinism and racism in his book Europe Since 1870, which is still taught as a textbook in universities: 
Charles Darwin, the English naturalist whose books On the Origin of Species, published in 1859, and The Descent of Man, which followed in 1871, launched controversies which affected many branches of European thought… The ideas of Darwin, and of some of his contemporaries such as the English philosopher Herbert Spencer, …were rapidly applied to questions far removed from the immediate scientific ones… The element of Darwinism which appeared most applicable to the development of society was the belief that the excess of population over the means of support necessitated a constant struggle for survival in which it was the strongest or the 'fittest' who won. 
From racists such as Arthur Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Hitler adopted a politicallyoriented racism, and a biological approach from Haeckel. 
In the book, Hitler talked of the struggle between the races, and maintained that "History would culminate in a new millennial empire of unparalleled splendor, based on a new racial hierarchy ordained by nature herself."81 
The truth of the matter is that human superiority has nothing to do with race. 
At the root of this incredible savagery lies the Darwinistfascist theory that regards human beings as a species of animal and some human races as "harmful animals." 
Himmler would even denigrate those in occupied countries who had wanted to fight on the side of Germany: I very soon formed a German SS in the various countries. We very soon got Germanic volunteers from them. 
First of all, it is impossible for fascists to genuinely defend religion, because their character and principles are the exact opposite of the ethical foundation that religion instills in people. 
For this reason, they seek to give the impression that they are committed to religion, although they also try to prevent its propagation through various measures and practices. 
Surely, only then will the trinity of blood, faith and state be complete.106 
Though he was a Darwinist, that is, one who denies creation by a divine being, when formulating his racist propaganda, Hitler made reference to creation, although distorting the idea, to use it as a justification for racism. 
The result of all racial crossing is therefore in brief always the following: (a) Lowering of the level of higher race; (b) Physical and intellectual regression and hence the beginning of a slowly but surely progressing sickness. To bring about such a development is, then, nothing else but to sin against the will of the eternal creator.108 
In an address he gave to church leaders on February 13, 1937, Dr. Kerrl openly declared Christianity a tool of Nazi ideology, "The party stands on the basis of Positive Christianity, and Positive Christianity is National Socialism... 
In the Nazis' opinion, it was not prophets of Jewish origin who should light the way for the German people, but the cruel and barbaric warriors of pagan German culture. 
They seek to portray a religious image of themselves by exploiting the language and symbols of faith in their slogans, and propaganda. 
It is important to make a careful estimation of Mussolini's state of mind as set out here. As we have seen, he revealed his hatred of and total lack of belief in God with open declaration of untruth about Him. 
In 1908, he wrote for the communist magazine La Lima under a false name, and thus clashed with the weekly Il Giornale Ligure, the publishing organ of the Catholics of Oneglia. 
Mussolini clearly referred to his ideological link with Darwinism in the pages of the communist weekly magazine La Lotta di Classe (Class Struggle), of which he was editor for a time. 
Cardinal Vicaire called upon the public to support the fascists in the same year. 
The Vatican withheld its approval of the Catholic Partito Popolare's [People's Party] antifascist attitude and had Don Sturzo removed from his post as party leader. 
The slogan mentioned below, during this period, is a testament of the "cult dedicated to Mussolini": "Do not delay for an instant in loving God. 
Robles tried to imitate German fascism in a number of areas, but he was unable to put forward the "superior" and "Aryan race" theory. 
The Church also served the fascists in other ways. 
The story of how various fascist regimes came to power is generally very much the same. 
Fascism is an ideology that seeks to turn European societies back to the pagan religions of preChristian Europe. 
(Koran, 10:65) Human beings are created by God with no distinction between race or skin color, but as helpless creatures utterly dependent on God. 
Then when the Trumpet is blown, no ties of kinship will exist between them on that day, nor may they question one another. 
Another feature of fascist morality is that it is quite capable of sacrificing thousands of innocent people without hesitation for the sake of those aims that it perceives to be sacred. Fascists, who think that "the end justifies the means," carry out all kinds of brutality for an end that is in itself utterly unjustifiable. 
The Koran speaks of intelligent, mild and moderate people who can restrain themselves when they become angry. 
Nothing that happens can make them aggressive or angry: 
If anyone does that, seeking the pleasure of God, We will give him an immense reward. 
However, fascism is a school of thought that systematizes the very opposite, and, under the influence of Darwinism, portrays itself as a "scientific" and rational approach. 
Pharaoh called to his people, saying, "My people, does the kingdom of Egypt not belong to me? Do not all these rivers flow under my control? 
As is clear from the examples given so far, there were important resemblances between Pharaoh's system and that of fascist regimes in our own time. 
They believed in the principle that "might is right," though the only true possessor of might and dominion is God. 
So We seized him and his troops and flung them into the sea. 
The cruelties they committed in an attempt to elevate themselves only led to their humiliation. 
But it must be remembered that the suffering in the hereafter is not just restricted to them, it also includes their followers. 
This truth is again revealed in the Koran: 
They will all parade before God and the weak will say to those who were arrogant, "We followed you, so can you help us at all against the punishment of God?' 
They will say, "If God had guided us, we would have guided you. 
It makes no difference whether we cannot stand it or bear it patiently. We have no way of escape." 
The terrorizing of the population, corpses piled up in morgues, or shot and thrown into the Mapocho River, the detention of suspects in the Santiago Stadium, hostagetakings, frequent search operations and lootings, were just a few of the crimes of the Pinochet regime. 
It was monstrous, but they were still alive. They were thrown on the ground and drenched with gasoline. 
William Blum speaks of victims "having their eyes put out, their testicles cut off and stuffed in their mouths, and their hands and feet cut off" by the security forces, as well as women "having their breasts cut off." 
In 1988 he engaged in a surprise and totally unjustified attack on Iran, occupying part of the country. 
We shall first see how racism is alive and well in Europe, and then consider the proliferation of neoNazi organizations. 
According to official German figures, there were 10,037 incidents of a racist or xenophobic nature in 1999. 
The number of such incidents in Great Britain was 10,982 between April and September alone. Half of these crimes consisted of threats or intimidation. Many of them, however, ended in death, injury, burning or destruction of property. 
Those responsible were fascist gangs known as neoNazis. 
But in the 1990s, most of the skinheads took to racism and began carrying out racist and fascist attacks as supporters of Nazism. At present, the neoNazi movement is growing stronger and spreading. 
In some countries, the unemployed and those living in poor areas can be chosen as targets. 
They can be easily recognized by the Nazi symbols on their clothes, their shaven heads, and their tattoos, generally referring to their hatred of other races. 
Most interestingly, racism is still an insidious problem in the Europe culture, which places great importance on democracy and human rights. According to research carried out in 1997, racists comprise some 33 percent of Europe's general population. 
These foreigners were treated like war criminals: questioned for days, and some had their arms or legs broken under torture.141 
People infected with fascism have no concept of feeling pride in other peoples' cultures, and only feel pride in their own roots…142 
Each of us is a member of the Aryan (or European) race, which, like the other races, developed its special characteristics over many thousands of years during which natural selection not only adapted it to its environment but also advanced it along its evolutionary path. 
The National Alliance goes even further, claiming that racism is a "duty to nature," and bases this assertion on an appeal to Nietzsche's philosophy: First, we have an obligation to the Nature of which we are a part to participate as effectively as we can in its eternal quest for higher levels of development, higher forms of life. 
As we have seen, racism, one of the fundamental characteristics of fascism, is on the rise in Europe, and behind it lies the spread of the Darwinistpaganism. But has pagan morality, which justifies the love of violence, bloodshed and mercilessness, other core fundamentals of fascism, also survived? 
Ideas such as "Life is a struggle, and only the strong can win," and "If you don't get them, they will get you," have their roots in Darwinism, are all ultimately responsible for the current increase in "fascism in daily life" throughout the world. 
This group is powerful and dominant in universities, the media, many scientific institutions, in the arts and literature, in cinema and television, and in many areas which influence the way people think. 
The important thing is, to silence those voices who whisper to others to believe: "Be ruthless, shed blood, kill, this is your instinct, you are only an animal, and when you die your life will be over." 
As we have been witnessing all through this book, fascism is an ideology that has wreaked great harm on humanity. 
And so, fascism is spreading, both as a spontaneous cultural phenomenon as well as on a systematic level. For this reason, countries such as Germany and Great Britain are caught in a terrible contradiction, essentially raising fascists which they are then eventually forced to fight. 
Darwin invested all his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve the "Difficulties of the Theory." 
It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while. 
It is calculated that if the information coded in DNA were written down, this would make a giant library consisting of 900 volumes of encyclopedias of 500 pages each. 
The second important point that negates Darwin's theory is that both concepts put forward by the theory as "evolutionary mechanisms" were understood to have, in reality, no evolutionary power. 
Or there should have existed some reptilebirds, which acquired some bird traits in addition to the reptilian traits they already had. Since these would be in a transitional phase, they should be disabled, defective, crippled living beings. 
He formed a spectrum of sciences ranging from those he considered scientific to those he considered unscientific. According to Zuckerman's spectrum, the most "scientific"–that is, depending on concrete data–fields of science are chemistry and physics. 
Zuckerman explains his reasoning: 
These electric signals are perceived in this center of the brain as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking. 
Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. 
For many years, ten of thousands of engineers have tried to make a threedimensional TV, and reach the vision quality of the eye. 
Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance.

Furthermore, it teaches them that the only law in life is a selfish struggle for survival and to stay alive. 
This theory is not a scientific law or a proven fact. Underneath its scientific façade it is a materialist worldview that Darwinists are trying to impose on society. 
However, even today many people think that the theory is a proven fact, like the force of gravity or the law of buoyancy. 
That is because the existence and spread of societies living in the light of that beautiful morality that true religion offers to man by means of God's commands and prohibitions is not in these materialists' interests. 
In other words, evolution collapses at the very first step: that of explaining the emergence of the first living cell. 
This combination of events has seemed an incredibly unlikely happenstance… 3 
The fossil record represents another crushing defeat for the theory of evolution. 
One is that living things emerged by evolution. 
According to the rules of logic, if one answer to a question with two alternative possible answers is proved to be false, then the other must be true. 
The world of living things is divided by biologists into such fundamental groups as plants, animals, fungae etc. 
According to Darwinism, life must be like a tree, with a common root, subsequently splitting up into different branches. 
And this hypothesis is constantly emphasized in Darwinist sources, where the concept of the "tree of life" is frequently employed. 
According to this tree concept, one phylum must first emerge, and then the other phyla must slowly come about with minute changes over very long periods of time. 
But is this really how it happened? 
Quite the contrary, animals have been very different and complex since the moment they first emerged. 
All the animal phyla known today emerged at the same time, in the middle of the geological period known as the Cambrian Age. 
These structures are at one and the same time very advanced, and very different. 
WHY DO THESE NOT SUPPORT EVOLUTION? 
A small barefoot Homo sapiens could have made them... 
These footprints sparked an important debate among evolutionists. 
It is confirmed that the fossil was that of a 12yearold boy, who would have been 1.83 metres tall in adolescence. 
We were very surprised when we saw it. 
In fact, in The Origin of Species, Darwin claimed that science would develop in just that direction. 
The philosopher Professor Arda Denkel, one of the foremost names in Turkish science, makes the following comment on this subject: 
It is enough to look at the history of science to realise what an invalid and irrational thing it is to claim that "evolution is the basis of biology." 
Stalin had ordered that all scientific research should conform to dialectical materialism. 
The result of this is a wide variety of individual features. 
All the people on Earth carry basically the same genetic information, yet some have slanted eyes, some have red hair, some have long noses, and others are short of stature, all depending on the extent of the variation potential of this genetic information. 
One may dominate the other, or they may both influence matters to an equal extent. 
One comes from the mother, the other from the father. 
This eventually led to the different races. However, this long period did not change one thing, of course. 
No matter what their height, skin colour and skull volume, all races are part of the human species. 
This, however, does not mean that these buildings "evolved" from each other. 
The theory of evolution maintains that the ancestors of birds were dinosaurs, members of the reptile family. 
The absence of a sternum (breastbone) in this creature was held up as the most important evidence that this bird could not fly properly. 
(The sternum is a bone found under the thorax to which the muscles required for flight are attached. 
The recently discovered seventh specimen of the Archaeopteryx preserves a partial, rectangular sternum, long suspected but never previously documented. 
A very important function of the feathers on birds is the maintenance of a constant body temperature. 
Many such incidents have taken place since it was first proposed. 
The German biologist Ernst Haeckel drew false pictures of embryos in order to support Darwin. 
All over the world, false pictures called "reconstructions," which have never actually lived, have been portrayed as "primitive creatures" or "apemen." 
The thesis that living things go through various stages in their mothers' wombs that can be seen as evidence for evolution has a special position amongst the unfounded claims of the theory of evolution. 
Since the subject of cloning has nothing to do with the theory of evolution, it cannot be a matter of concern for any professional evolutionist. 
Such an example of cloning is only to be found in science fiction, and is not and never will be possible. 
Creating a human being or any other living thing—in other words bringing something into existence out of nothing—is a power peculiar to God. 
When Darwin put forward his theory in the middle of the nineteenth century, he never mentioned how the origin of life, in other words the first living cell, came to be. 
Scientists looking for the origin of life at the beginning of the twentieth century began to realise that the theory was invalid. 
Crick came to realise that it is quite unreasonable to expect life to have started by chance, but he has claimed instead that life on Earth was started by intelligent "extraterrestrial" powers. 
One point which needs to be considered is that those scientists who look to outer space to find the origin of life do not actually make any new interpretation of the matter. 
For this reason, any idea that seeks the origin of life on Earth in another matterbased life form in the universe has to explain in turn how that form of life came into existence. 
(That is because the laws of physics and chemistry are the same everywhere in the universe, and they make it impossible for life to emerge by chance.) 
This shows that God, Who is beyond matter and time, and possesses infinite might, wisdom, and knowledge, created the universe and everything in it. 
For instance, the German scientist Ernst Haeckel, who supported Darwin, claimed that a living cell could originate from simple mud. 
The only difference between these two scenarios is that in the former there is an intelligent, knowledgeable, and powerful intervention. 
If it is not, time has destructive effects, not constructive ones. 
The law of entropy, known as the "Second Law of Thermodynamics," states that all systems in the universe tend directly towards disorder, dispersion, and decay when left to themselves and to natural conditions. 
For example, things fall to Earth because of the force of gravity. They do not start to fall upwards with the passage of time. Neither will they do so even if trillions of years go by. 
Taking that as a starting point, they then try to send out the message, "If the living body had really been created, it would have no functionless organs in it." 
Yet some evolutionists still try to make use of this claim. 
Many dentists, influenced by the evolutionists' claim that wisdom teeth serve no purpose, have come to see their extraction as a routine matter, and do not make the same kind of effort to protect them as they do for other teeth.53 However, research in recent years has shown that wisdom teeth have the same chewing function as other teeth. 
Then go and find some human fossils from the Cambrian Age! 
Anyone who does that will disprove the theory of evolution, and even win the Nobel Prize for his discovery.56 
The statement that living things developed from primitive forms to complex ones is an evolutionist prejudice that in no way reflects the truth. 
The American professor of biology Frank L. Marsh, who considered that evolutionist claim, maintains in his book Variation and Fixity in Nature, that living things cannot be arranged in a continuous, unbroken series from simple to complex.57 
For this reason, Darwin was unable to treat the subject fully in the book. 
As for the question of why there were no fossils of these creatures, he tried to supply an answer throughout his book, using the excuse that "the fossil record is very lacking." 
Another example is the astonishing resemblances between mammals' eyes and those of octopuses which lived on Earth millions of years before mammals. 
That also applies to the Cambrian Age, the finding of human fossils from which, according to the evolutionist Kence, would invalidate the theory of evolution. 
If evolutionists wish to show that one species turned into another, then showing that living things emerged step by step on the Earth is no good. 
Darwin accepted that, and wrote that countless examples of these would have to be found, even though none were so far available. 
In the 150 years that have passed since then, no intermediate forms have been found. 
The German Max Planck, who laid the foundations of modern physics, said: 
The Qur'an expresses this fact thus: 
(Qur'an, 21: 30) 
As opposed to all this, it was the primitive state of science 150 years ago that prepared the ground for the formation of the theory of evolution. 
On the contrary, such people are their greatest supporters. 
God has revealed many verses in the Qur'an which deal with the creation of man, life, and the universe. 
If there were such a thing as "creation by means of evolution," we should be able to see the proof of it today. 
Then again, there would be millions of fossils of intermediate forms that had lived in the past, and there would be living things in our time that had not yet completed their transition processes. 
In the same way as this fact destroys the theory of evolution, which claims that life came about by chance, it also shows the scientific invalidity of the claim that God brought life into being and then it evolved by stages. 
That is why scientists should accept the "design," or the fact of creation in other words, which scientific discoveries have proved. 
This will become apparent when we consider these questions one by one. 
From even closer up, he will be left in absolutely no doubt. 
Scientific developments have revealed the perfection in life on the system, organ, tissue, cellular, and even molecular levels. 
The record jumps, and all the evidence shows that the record is real: the gaps we see reflect real events in life's history—not the artifact of a poor fossil record. 
Another American scholar, Robert Wesson, states in his 1991 book Beyond Natural Selection, that "the gaps in the fossil record are real and phenomenal." He elaborates this claim in this way: 
Metamorphosis, however, bears no similarity at all to that claim, being a preplanned process which has nothing to do with mutation or chance. 
On the contrary, when the complexity of the process and the systems that control it are taken into consideration, animals which undergo metamorphosis can be seen to be clear evidence for creation. 
It would be impossible to read it all in one lifetime. 
That means some 1,000 large volumes—more than enough to fill a big library. 
Furthermore, if we multiply that number by the six billion people currently living on the Earth, and the billions more who have ever lived, then the number is beyond our capacity to grasp, and the amount of information stretches to infinity. 
If one day the formula of a medicine that can cure cancer were found on a piece of paper, all of mankind would join forces to discover the scientist concerned and even give him an award. 
Antibiotics derived from microorganisms were used against bacteria and the results were successful. Soon, something new was discovered. 
[T]he organisms having these genes can transfer them to other bacteria making them resistant as well. 
The acquisition of antibiotic resistance in this manner... is not the kind that can serve as a prototype for the mutations needed to account for Evolution… The genetic changes that could illustrate the theory must not only add information to the bacterium's genome, they must add new information to the biocosm. 
The second type of immunity, which comes about as a result of mutation, is not an example of evolution either. Spetner writes: ... 
To sum up, a mutation impinging on a bacterium's ribosome makes that bacterium resistant to streptomycin. 
As we have shown in all the questions we have considered so far, the theory of evolution is completely at odds with scientific discoveries. 
Studying matter is not the same as being a materialist 
They say, "Matter is the only subject of study for science, so it has to be materialist." 
For instance, let us imagine a cave. We do not know if anyone has been in it before us. 
The evolutionist biologist Andrew Scott makes the following admission on the subject in the wellknown journal New Scientist: 
In truth, the mechanism of almost every major step, from chemical precursors up to the first recognizable cells, is the subject of either controversy or complete bewilderment.75 
The root of life is based on speculation and debate because materialist dogma insists that life is the product of matter. 
Yet the scientific facts show that matter has no such power. 
As the banner headline "Science Finds God," used by the famous magazine Newsweek in its historic July 27, 1998, edition makes clear, behind all the materialist deception, science finds God, the Creator of the universe and all that is in it.

Let me tell you something interesting about the Caretta sea turtle: 
Amar said:"You're right. Everyone with a mind to think with must know that the world is full of Allah's wonders. 
Every year, storks migrate in large numbers because they can't live in cold regions. 
Of course it is Allah Who inspires such a good memory and sense of direction in them. 
We didn't acquire our trunks by chance. 
Zubair agreed: "You're right, Rasheed, what he did was not right at all. 
Allah has given us these things to test us and to see how we will act if He gives us such blessings. 
Allah does not love any vain or boastful man.' 
(Surah Ta Ha: 131) What Asim did was wrong, but wasn't it also wrong for his friends to be impressed and act in a way that wouldn't be pleasing to Allah? 
Why, when you entered your garden, did you not say, 'It is as Allah wills, there is no strength but in Allah?' 
He imagined that he lived where those animals did, and suddenly he found himself in a place all covered with snow.

JAMAL AND THE PARROT 
Jamal had always wanted to keep a pet bird at home. 
Jamal was so happy. That first evening, Jamal and the parrot had a deep conversation. 
"I can imitate the sounds I hear, but I can't understand them. 
"Remember," said the parrot: "The best thing we can do when we see all the perfection of our Almighty Lord's creation of the universe is to remember His greatness, thank Him and always keep Him in our minds." He is Allahtha Creator. The Maker, the Giver of Form… (Surat alHashr:24) THERE’S GOOD IN EVERYTHING 
Ali is a good student in primary school. 
One day, while returning home from school, Ali was very happy and, as always, excited. 
He immediately started to tell his mother what had happened at school. 
Ali's mother called them to dinner. 
They all sat down at the table together. 
Ali's father also noticed how gloomy he was. 
He is AllHearing, AllSeeing.' 
Ahmad ran toward the ducks. 
"I was thinking," said Ahmad: "If they didn't feed you here, or if you lived somewhere where there were no human beings, how would you find food?" 
The duck went on: "It is because of our webbed feet that we can swim so easily. 
Because of her dull colors, her enemies can't see her, and she is much safer as she sits there. 
At that moment Ahmad saw some baby ducks swimming in the water. 
"Come on Ahmad," he said: "Dinner is almost ready. We'd better make our way back home." 
At times, they have even been observed traveling a distance of 1740 feet (530 meters) in six glides, one after another."

One should neither hold himself above another nor transgress against another.'' (Muslim) Believers are those who know that Allah created everything, that all things belong to Him and that it is He Who gives to human beings their every blessing. 
Believers are physically very clean. Their bodies as well as their food, clothing and the place where they live are always amazingly spotless and wellordered. 
… Do not associate anything with Me and purify My House for those who circle it, and those who stand and bow and prostrate. 
Purify your clothes. 
(Surat alMuddaththir: 45)" 
Uncle Hamid responded by saying: "Some people, although they don't practice the morality of the Qur'an, are very careful about cleanliness. 
Because they do not think of pleasing Allah when they clean themselves, they do not pay attention to their cleanliness or their appearance when they are by themselves or with people they care nothing about. 
"We don't look in a mirror to see how beautiful we are. 
"Do you think I could paint these beautiful designs in my tail?" asked the peacock "Of course not, my little friend.

"Just like flippers!" Anwar exclaimed. 
While Anwar and the bird were having this conversation, his mother told him to go to his room and do his homework. At the same time, the rain stopped, too.

He has created plants for the benefit of human beings and all animals. This flawless process that modern human technology cannot even fully understand has been used by leaves for millions of years. 
"So, how did this process take place?," he wondered. 
Suddenly, an experiment they did in school came to his mind. 
"Grandpa," he said, "I want to ask you something." 
A person who learns the real meaning of patience can behave in the way that Allah desires from him and be regular in performing his prayers. A person of faith knows that Allah's knowledge and wisdom is in everything, nothing happens without His permission and that, behind every event, lie the purpose and all the countless good things that He has created."

Friend, you’re not the guilty one 
"In all this there is a mistake on your part. 
She, too, flushed, and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes. "All?" he asked, with a malignant grin. 
I am not committing a murder. 
In what way will you get convincing proof today that you can respect him, and that he... esteems you, as you said. 
"We showed him, Rodya. We... consulted him just now," Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, embarrassed. 
"Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap education, he is proud indeed of having made his own way," Avdotya Romanovna observed, somewhat offended by her brother's tone. 
It all shows the man and... 
"I decided to ask you, Rodya, to urge you not to fail to be with us at this interview," said Dounia. 
Raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where Zossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served him as a bed, was too familiar a place, he hurriedly motioned her to Razumihin's chair. 
Sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise her eyes again, but was more embarrassed than ever. 
So that, today, they will carry it to the cemetery, into the chapel, until tomorrow. 
"Today, then?" 
"What do you mean?" 
And will you, Dmitri Prokofitch, do us the favour of dining with us?" 
"Dounia, goodbye," called Raskolnikov, in the passage. 
"Never mind, give it to me again." 
Surely he can't be an egoist, Dounia. Eh? 
Why, it is a piano they have got, I declare... how they push... 
Porfiry Petrovitch?" 
I do not want to lose the things, especially the watch. 
I know I ought to have given notice at the police station, but would it not be better to go straight to Porfiry? 
"And he will be very, very glad to make your acquaintance. 
"If you have to go now," Sonia was beginning, not looking at Razumihin at all, and still more embarrassed. 
People are happy who have no need of locks," he said, laughing, to Sonia. 
They stood still in the gateway. 
Never, never had she felt anything like this. 
His eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look; his lips were crimson. 
He was a remarkedly wellpreserved man and looked much younger than his years. 
Only then Sonia noticed him. 
The doors were two or three yards apart. 
"What are you glad about?" Raskolnikov thought to himself. 
"I didn't know that you pledged things at the old woman's, too. 
But I am not going to redeem the things now," he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous solicitude about the things. 
Rather clumsy, that is to say, he is a man of polished manners, but I mean clumsy in a different sense. 
"But why are you apologizing? 
But the most natural thing would be to do nothing at all. 
We shall see... directly. Is it a good thing to go or not? 
Raskolnikov, not waiting for an introduction, bowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, who stood in the middle of the room looking inquiringly at them. He held out his hand and shook hands, still apparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a few words to introduce himself. 
"I've got to think of that," he thought. 
Why, won't he even say goodmorning?" Porfiry Petrovitch nodded at Razumihin. 
"What does this mean?" thought Raskolnikov uneasily. 
Raskolnikov interrupted eagerly, again interested in the financial side of the question. 
"Why did I say that about women?" 
"In my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but you were extremely irritable," Zametov pronounced dryly. 
Mr. Zametov knows I've found a treasure! 
Excuse us, please, for disturbing you for half an hour with such trivialities," he said turning to Porfiry Petrovitch, with trembling lips. 
"The worst of it is they don't disguise it; they don't care to stand on ceremony! 
He was shaking with rage. 
"Come, strike me openly, don't play with me like a cat with a mouse. 
Perhaps it's all unintentional. 
Why do they speak in that tone? 
Did Porfiry wink at me just now? 
They're as thick as thieves, no doubt, over me! 
He knows all about last night! 
I know what to say to them.... 
He will try to catch me. 
But what they want though it smells of death and can be made of Indiarubber, at least is not alive, has no will, is servile and won't revolt! 
That's the great thing, you mustn't think! 
"Can you imagine," he turned to Raskolnikov, "six people holding forth like that last night, in one room, with punch as a preliminary! 
Not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was going to get married, that he had everything ready for the wedding. 
We all began to congratulate him. There was no bride, nothing, all pure fantasy!" 
"And the Weekly Review ceased to exist, so that's why it wasn't printed at the time." 
Otherwise it's hard for them to get out of the common rut; and to remain in the common rut is what they can't submit to, from their very nature again, and to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to it. 
As for my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge that it's somewhat arbitrary, but I don't insist upon exact numbers. 
The second category all transgress the law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their capacities. 
Excuse my curiosity." 
"And... do you believe in Lazarus' rising from the dead?" 
That remark is wittier than the other." 
"No reason to; but take note that the mistake can only arise in the first category, that is among the ordinary people (as I perhaps unfortunately called them). 
I am ready to bow down to them, of course, but you must admit it's alarming if there are a great many of them, eh?" 
"People with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity for saying something new, are extremely few in number, extraordinarily so in fact. 
Society is too well protected by prisons, banishment, criminal investigators, penal servitude. 
"Simply from humanity." 
That will be his punishment as well as the prison." "But the real geniuses," asked Razumihin frowning, "those who have the right to murder? 
Oughtn't they to suffer at all even for the blood they've shed?" 
We had to trouble Dmitri too.... 
"Yes," answered Raskolnikov, with an unpleasant sensation at the very moment he spoke that he need not have said it. 
"Painters? 
But on the fourth storey" (he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant) "I remember now that some one was moving out of the flat opposite Alyona Ivanovna's.... 
I quite muddled it." 
But they have no facts, not one. It is all mirage all ambiguous. Simply a floating idea. 
"And it's insulting, insulting! 
But if you had done that, could you have said you had seen them painting the flat... and the workmen? 
If a man is ever so little developed and experienced, he will certainly try to admit all the external facts that can't be avoided, but will seek other explanations of them, will introduce some special, unexpected turn, that will give them another significance and put them in another light. 
"Why, he there was asking whether a student lived here, mentioned your name and whom you lodged with. 
The man turned to the left without looking behind him. Raskolnikov remained standing, gazing after him. 
So he lay for half an hour. 
The images followed one another, whirling like a hurricane. 
And from where did he see? Why has he only now sprung out of the earth? And how could he see? 
"I ought to have known it," he thought with a bitter smile. 
The real Master to whom all is permitted storms Toulon, makes a massacre in Paris, forgets an army in Egypt, wastes half a million men in the Moscow expedition and gets off with a jest at Vilna. 
No, such people it seems are not of flesh but of bronze!" One sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh. 
Thirdly, because I aimed at carrying it out as justly as possible, weighing, measuring and calculating. Of all the lice I picked out the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as I needed for the first step, no more nor less (so the rest would have gone to a monastery, according to her will, haha!). 
The 'prophet' is right, he is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows up the innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain! 
Why did she come in?... 
It was very dark and empty in the passage, as though everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour which was flooded with moonlight. 
"She is afraid," he thought. He stealthily took the axe from the noose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull. 
Raskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed them again. 
"Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigailov, allow me to introduce myself...." 
"It's simply that whether you are right or wrong, we dislike you. 
It was in those days, that very year I believe, the 'disgraceful action of the Age' took place (you know, 'The Egyptian Nights,' that public reading, you remember? 
After saying this, Svidrigailov broke into a sudden laugh again. 
I am not such a bear, you know, as you think." 
"I am not particularly interested in any one's opinion," Svidrigailov answered, dryly and even with a shade of haughtiness, "and therefore why not be vulgar at times when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our climate... and especially if one has a natural propensity that way," he added, laughing again. 
I am not going to see them, I was sick of them long ago. 
I've been here three days and have called on no one.... 
Yes, there's a great deal I didn't notice when I was here eight years ago, kicking up my heels.... 
"But as for these clubs, Dussauts, parades, or progress, indeed, may be well, all that can go on without me," he went on, again without noticing the question. 
"Why, have you been a cardsharper then?" 
"No, the document didn't restrain me," Svidrigailov went on, meditatively. 
Really, perhaps I am. 
I wouldn't say no exactly." 
I saw her first on the very day of the funeral, an hour after she was buried. 
It was the day before I left to come here. 
I can almost hear her." 
"What does she say when she comes to you?" 
I shall never forgive myself for not asking her to. 
"You should go to a doctor." 
But as soon as one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is broken, one begins to realise the possibility of another world; and the more seriously ill one is, the closer becomes one's contact with that other world, so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that world. 
If you believe in a future life, you could believe in that, too." 
Instead of all that, what if it's one little room, like a bathhouse in the country, black and grimy and spiders in every corner, and that's all eternity is? 
"Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than that?" Raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of anguish. "Juster? 
"Through idleness and depravity," Raskolnikov put in. 
"In any case this is unpardonable impertinence." 
If I died, for instance, and left that sum to your sister in my will, surely she wouldn't refuse it?" 
"And if I do tell her, will you not try to see her?" 
Marfa Petrovna arranged it a week before her death, and it was done in my presence. 
I'll find out, though." 
"Yes, I noticed him, I noticed him well." 
I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking to him, but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked away. 
At last I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him as a cousin I'd brain him. 
But, you see, I thought I'd made a mess of it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea struck me: why should we trouble? 
We shall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if I were in your place I'd mystify them more than ever. 
Pulcheria Alexandrovna came forward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was welcoming her brother. 
Razumihin and Raskolnikov were facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna, Razumihin was next to Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister. 
Pyotr Petrovitch deliberately drew out a cambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of a benevolent man who felt himself slighted, and was firmly resolved to insist on an explanation. 
"I had the pleasure... yesterday," muttered Pyotr Petrovitch with a hostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he scowled and was silent. 
"Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps disposed him, to suicide, was the systematic persecution and severity of Mr. Svidrigailov." 
"You wrote that you had been insulted by my brother; I think that this must be explained at once, and you must be reconciled. 
"That wasn't what I was speaking of exactly, Pyotr Petrovitch," Dounia interrupted with some impatience. 
I don't want to be mistaken in my choice, and I must not be. 
You say 'you or he,' showing thereby of how little consequence I am in your eyes... 
You wrote this to make dissension between me and my family, and for that object added coarse expressions about the conduct of a girl whom you don't know. 
"You may see for yourself, Avdotya Romanovna," he said, "whether it is possible for us to agree. 
I hope now that this question is at an end, once and for all. 
"But in withdrawing, I venture to request that for the future I may be spared similar meetings, and, so to say, compromises. 
I appeal particularly to you, honoured Pulcheria Alexandrovna, on this subject, the more as my letter was addressed to you and to no one else." 
Dounia has told you the reason your desire was disregarded, she had the best intentions. 
We are to blame for having agreed to a wrong action, and I above all...." 
Not a movement!" cried Raskolnikov, holding Razumihin back; then going close up to Luzhin, "Kindly leave the room!" he said quietly and distinctly, "and not a word more or..." 
Pyotr Petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a pale face that worked with anger, then he turned, went out, and rarely has any man carried away in his heart such vindictive hatred as he felt against Raskolnikov. 
It is noteworthy that as he went downstairs he still imagined that his case was perhaps not utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies were concerned, all might "very well indeed" be set right again. 
Pyotr Petrovitch, who had made his way up from insignificance, was morbidly given to selfadmiration, had the highest opinion of his intelligence and capacities, and sometimes even gloated in solitude over his image in the glass. 
The next day, the very next day, it must all be set right, smoothed over, settled. 
"No, I, I am more to blame than any one!" said Dounia, kissing and embracing her mother. 
Now he had the right to devote his life to them, to serve them.... 
"How do you explain him to yourself, Rodya? 
"I must confess I don't quite understand him. 
But I may be mistaken; that may only be the part he assumes. 
He said to me himself just now. 'Take care of my sister.' 
Dounia smiled and held out her hand, but the look of anxiety did not leave her face. 
I know what that means; he simply wants to help me. 
For nearly two years I've been scuttling about among the publishers, and now I know every detail of their business. You need not be a saint to make pots, believe me! 
We'll begin in a small way and go on to a large. 
In any case it will get us our living and we shall get back our capital." 
I'll pawn your watch tomorrow and bring you the money, and everything can be arranged then. 
"No matter, I shall come.... I'm coming," he muttered in an undertone, as though not fully conscious of what he was saying, and he went out of the room. 
It was dark in the corridor, they were standing near the lamp. For a minute they were looking at one another in silence. 
A wall with three windows looking out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute angle, and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light. 
"How thin you are! 
"They live there, through that door?" 
"All in one room?" 
And they are very kind and the children, too, often come to see me." 
"They all stammer, don't they?" 
But where did you hear about them?" she added with some surprise. 
Sonia was confused. 
I was walking in the street, out there at the corner, about ten o'clock and he seemed to be walking in front. 
"You were walking in the streets?" 
Good heavens, beat me! 
"Oh, no, don't talk like that.... We are one, we live like one." Sonia was agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some other little bird were to be angry. 
And all the day long she has been washing, cleaning, mending. She dragged the wash tub into the room with her feeble hands and sank on the bed, gasping for breath. 
I was cruel! 
"Yes, I I. I went to see them," she went on, weeping, "and father said, 'read me something, Sonia, my head aches, read to me, here's a book.' 
He had a book he had got from Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he lives there, he always used to get hold of such funny books. 
I spoke like that to her, I ought not to have said that! 
Ah, if I... but it's nothing to you!" 
"Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption, rapid consumption; she will soon die," said Raskolnikov after a pause, without answering her question. 
It can't be, no!" Sonia cried aloud in desperation, as though she had been stabbed. 
She looked at him with unutterable reproach, tried to say something, but could not speak and broke into bitter, bitter sobs, hiding her face in her hands. 
He put his two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful face. 
"Sit down with me! 
But he saw how monstrously the thought of her disgraceful, shameful position was torturing her and had long tortured her. 
The last idea was the most revolting, but he was a sceptic, he was young, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he could not help believing that the last end was the most likely. 
"Can that creature who has still preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at last into that sink of filth and iniquity? 
No doubt she does. Doesn't that all mean madness?" 
He liked that explanation indeed better than any other. He began looking more intently at her. 
"So you pray to God a great deal, Sonia?" he asked her. 
You don't deserve!" she cried suddenly, looking sternly and wrathfully at him. 
That's the explanation," he decided, scrutinising her with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, almost morbid feeling. 
"Lizaveta! strange!" he thought. 
Do you often go?" 
She was killed with an axe." 
And here was something new again: the mysterious meetings with Lizaveta and both of them religious maniacs. 
"I shall be a religious maniac myself soon! 
"You used to read to Lizaveta." 
He understood only too well how painful it was for her to betray and unveil all that was her own. 
Raskolnikov sat without moving, his elbows on the table and his eyes turned away. 
Jesus said, Take you away the stone. 
I've broken with them completely." 
"What for? 
Do you mean to tell me Polenka won't come to grief? 
What, you don't understand? 
And some day later on, in years to come, you'll understand perhaps what they meant. 
Goodbye, don't shake hands. 
"Oh, he must be terribly unhappy!... He has abandoned his mother and sister.... 
In the next room which looked like an office, several clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had no notion who or what Raskolnikov might be. 
"In our domain," the apologies for familiarity, the French phrase tout court, were all characteristic signs. 
Both were watching each other, but when their eyes met, quick as lightning they looked away. 
The latter fact was very significant in Raskolnikov's eyes: he saw that Porfiry Petrovitch had not been embarrassed just before either, but that he, Raskolnikov, had perhaps fallen into a trap; that there must be something, some motive here unknown to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness and in another moment would break upon him... 
And if you must examine me, do so in the proper form! I will not allow you to do so otherwise, and so meanwhile, goodbye, as we have evidently nothing to keep us now." 
"I must tell you one thing about myself, my dear Rodion Romanovitch," Porfiry Petrovitch continued, moving about the room and again avoiding his visitor's eyes. 
What do you think? 
Porfiry Petrovitch took breath a moment. 
"Is he expecting anything?" 
But evidence, you know, can generally be taken two ways. 
They say that at Sevastopol, soon after Alma, the clever people were in a terrible fright that the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at once. 
He felt that his parched lips were flecked with foam, his heart was throbbing. 
"No, I see you don't believe me, you think I am playing a harmless joke on you," Porfiry began again, getting more and more lively, chuckling at every instant and again pacing round the room. 
I listen to an old man am speaking seriously, Rodion Romanovitch (as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch who was scarcely five and thirty actually seemed to have grown old; even his voice changed and he seemed to shrink together) moreover, I'm a candid man... am I a candid man or not? 
"I won't allow it!" he shouted, bringing his fist down on the table. 
"I won't allow it, I won't allow it," Raskolnikov repeated mechanically, but he too spoke in a sudden whisper. 
I have guessed how you feel, haven't I? 
Only in that way you'll lose your head and Razumihin's, too; he's too good a man for such a position, you must know that. 
You are ill and he is good and your illness is infectious for him... 
You were delirious when you did all this!" 
"I was not delirious. I knew what I was doing," he cried, straining every faculty to penetrate Porfiry's game, "I was quite myself, do you hear?" 
He still stared at him as he said this and again there was a light of intense hatred in his eyes. "You keep lying," he said. 
"Good heavens! 
I, an examining lawyer, have betrayed a precious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a fact worth having), and you see nothing in it! 
Raskolnikov started so that Porfiry Petrovitch could not fail to perceive it. 
"I am lying?" Porfiry repeated, apparently incensed, but preserving a goodhumoured and ironical face, as though he were not in the least concerned at Raskolnikov's opinion of him. 
I tell you I won't have it. 
Now he was peremptory, stern, frowning and for once laying aside all mystification. But this was only for an instant. 
"Arrest me, search me, but kindly act in due form and don't play with me! 
And he brought a key out of his pocket. 
You knew I was ill and tried to work me into a frenzy to make me betray myself, that was your object! 
You expected them! 
But at this moment a strange incident occurred, something so unexpected that neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry Petrovitch could have looked for such a conclusion to their interview. 
The man whom he had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing him by the shoulder; he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his arm away. 
"You're in too great a hurry," he shouted at him, almost angrily. 
"Don't mention it, don't mention it," Porfiry replied, almost gleefully. 
"I don't know what to wish you," said Raskolnikov, who had begun to descend the stairs, but looked back again. 
You must admit it's a comical business!" 
Had he really some surprise prepared for him? 
"I got there two minutes before you. 
It was false economy! 
Andrey Semyonovitch was an anaemic, scrofulous little man, with strangely flaxen muttonchop whiskers of which he was very proud. 
He was rather softhearted, but selfconfident and sometimes extremely conceited in speech which had an absurd effect, incongruous with his little figure. 
"Hehehe!" Luzhin went on laughing maliciously. 
I might indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda. 
You know, Terebyeva (who is in the community now) was blamed because when she left her family and... devoted... herself, she wrote to her father and mother that she wouldn't go on living conventionally and was entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh, that she might have spared them and have written more kindly. 
That's how letters like that ought to be written!" 
Setting aside the general question of chastity and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed prejudices, I fully accept her chastity with me, because that's for her to decide. 
"You had much better make her a present of something. 
Of course, she is in such a position, but it's another question. Quite another question! You simply despise her. 
She listened attentively to an account of the workmen's associations in France, too. 
"And what's that, pray?" 
I think they've all come back from the cemetery... 
I'll go directly and you may be sure I won't be in your way." 
Pyotr Petrovitch began with great dignity, though affably. It was evident that his intentions were friendly. 
Sonia sat down hurriedly. 
Her eyes rested again for an instant on the grey and rainbowcoloured notes that remained on the table, but she quickly looked away and fixed her eyes on Pyotr Petrovitch. She felt it horribly indecorous, especially for her, to look at another person's money. 
"Or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say, ill." 
So then from a feeling of humanity and so to speak compassion, I should be glad to be of service to her in any way, foreseeing her unfortunate position. 
"No, I haven't heard," muttered Sonia. 
Tomorrow it will all fall upon you again, they won't have a crust of bread. 
"Children are a social question and a question of first importance, I agree; but the question of children has another solution. 
That is only the natural consequence of a legal marriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest. So that indeed it's not humiliating... and if I ever, to suppose an absurdity, were to be legally married, I should be positively glad of it. 
And Katerina Ivanovna was not brokenspirited; she might have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit could not have been broken, that is, she could not have been intimidated, her will could not be crushed. 
Moreover Sonia had said with good reason that her mind was unhinged. She could not be said to be insane, but for a year past she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained. 
It needed the utmost delicacy, the greatest nicety, but she has managed things so that that fool, that conceited baggage, that provincial nonentity, simply because she is the widow of a major, and has come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in the government offices, because at fifty she paints her face (everybody knows it)... a creature like that did not think fit to come, and has not even answered the invitation, which the most ordinary good manners required! 
But where's Sonia? 
Now Bridget, knowing the merits of the venerable Mael, begged from him some work of his hands as a rich present. Mael cast a handbell of bronze for her and, when it was finished, he blessed it and threw it into the sea. 
And the bell went ringing towards the coast of Gad, where St. Bridget, warned by the sound of the bell upon the waves, received it piously, and carried it in solemn procession with singing of psalms into the chapel of the convent. 
He had already passed through twothirds of the way of life, and he hoped peacefully to reach his terrestrial end in the midst of his spiritual brethren, when he knew by a certain sign that the Divine wisdom had decided otherwise, and that the Lord was calling him to less peaceful but not less meritorious labours. 
St. Samson entered the Bay of St. Michael's Mount in a granite vessel which will one day be called St. Samson's basin. 
Some represented winged children, others Apollo or Mercury, and several were in the form of a naked woman twisting her hair. 
Immediately pointing to that image he said: "That is the Virgin, the mother of God. 
"Let us respect in them," he said, "the daughters of Bridget and the betrothed of the Lord. 
The holy man resolved forthwith to visit his faithless children, so that he might lead them back to the faith and prevent them from yielding to such sacrilege. 
"Well," urged the Devil, "is it not prudence in this case to rig the vessel?" 
"Father, if you lost your right foot and God restored it to you, would not that foot be miraculous?" 
And if we undertook it might we not lose time instead of gaining it?" 
"That for you, father!" 
All distended is thy sail Like the breast of Juno When from it gushed the Milky Way. 
Twenty times the boat was filled by masses of sea. 
He went along the coast for a whole day and a night, passing around the reef which formed an insuperable barrier. 
He discovered in this way that it was a round island in the middle of which rose a mountain crowned with clouds. 
Thinking that what he saw were men living under the natural law, and that the Lord had sent him to teach them the Divine law, he preached the gospel to them. 
From moment to moment they moved their winglets like arms, and uttered peaceful cries. 
Just as the sun melts the ice of your mountains so Jesus Christ will melt the ice of your hearts." 
And he taught them the origin, the nature, and the effects of baptism. 
Then, having previously blessed the water that fell from the cascades and recited the exorcisms, he baptized those whom he had just taught, pouring on each of their heads a drop of pure water and pronouncing the sacred words. 
VI. AN ASSEMBLY IN PARADISE When the baptism of the penguins was known in Paradise, it caused neither joy nor sorrow, but an extreme surprise. 
Called to give his opinion, Pope St. Damascus expressed himself in these terms: "In order to know if a baptism is valid and will produce its result, that is to say, sanctification, it is necessary to consider who gives it and not who receives it. 
It deals, it is true, with a diabolical operation. 
I learned then from the mouth of the angel who brought me here, that Barjas, the tavernkeeper of the Porta Capena, had sold for wine a decoction of roots and barks in which there was not a single drop of the juice of the grape. 
"No," answered the Lord. "The remedy would be worse than the disease. 
"I know that better than you do," replied the Lord. 
Now there is no doubt about the answer." 
"They have not tuneful voices to sing your praises. They would not be able to celebrate your mysteries." 
But none were as disgusting as the harpies whose offal polluted the leaves of my sycamore." 
"Harpies," observed Lactantius, "are female Monsters with birds' bodies. 
They have a woman's head and breast. 
Nevertheless they were infallible, for I was with them." 
The holy man, dazzled by a vivid light, inebriated by a delicious odour, recognised the angel of the Lord, and prostrated himself with his forehead on the ground. 
However, there remained with them some traces of their first nature. 
And Mael gave thanks to the Lord, because he had incorporated these penguins into the family of Abraham. 
He fastened one end of the cord round a point of rock that jutted up through the sand of the shore and, holding the other end of the cord in his hand, he entered the stone trough. 
"Since they have been incorporated into the family of Abraham these penguins share the curse of Eve, and they know that they are naked, a thing of which they were ignorant before. 
With these words the monk, Magis, reached the female penguin in three bounds, lifted her up, carried her in his arms with her hair trailing behind her, and threw her, overcome with fright, at the feet of the holy Mael. 
When he had, with much care and study, enclosed the soft parts of her bust in this way, he covered her whole body with a rosecoloured tunic which gently followed the lines of her figure. 
Then she went away, walking with short steps and swinging her hips. 
Their habits were innocent. 
Its coasts were now very extensive and clearly defined and its shape reminded one of a mulberry leaf. 
To the south, orchards and woods bounded the languid Bay of Divers. 
"As they fight they exchange invectives and threats. 
At that moment the holy Mael clasped his hands and sighed deeply. 
Whilst the monk, Bulloch, was pronouncing these words a big penguin with a fair skin and red hair went down into the valley carrying a trunk of a tree upon his shoulder. 
He went up to a little penguin who was watering his vegetables in the heat of the sun, and shouted to him: "Your field is mine!" 
Reflect, above all, that in blaming the big penguin you are attacking property in its origin and in its source. 
Mael remained silent and motionless, with his eyes raised towards heaven; he felt a painful uncertainty in judging the monk Bulloch's doctrine. 
IV. THE FIRST ASSEMBLY OF THE ESTATES OF PENGUINIA "Bulloch, my son," said old Mael, "we ought to make a census of the Penguins and inscribe each of their names in a book." 
Although children died in marvellous abundance and plagues and famines came with perfect regularity to devastate entire villages, new Penguins, in continually greater numbers, contributed by their private misery to the public prosperity. 
V. THE MARRIAGE OF KRAKEN AND ORBEROSIA During these times there lived in the island of Alca a Penguin whose arm was strong and whose mind was subtle. 
He was called Kraken, and had his dwelling on the Beach of Shadows whither the inhabitants never ventured for fear of serpents that lodged in the hollows of the rocks and lest they might encounter the souls of Penguins that had died without baptism. 
Kraken dwelt on this savage coast in an inaccessible cavern. The only way to it was through a natural tunnel a hundred feet long, the entrance of which was concealed by a thick wood. 
The rich Penguins of the valley of Dalles reared domestic animals, while those of the Bay of Divers cultivated their orchards. 
A few days before, the maiden Orberosia had disappeared. 
Every family was in mourning and the island was full of lamentations. 
To these questions the chief of the Elders answered: "O Mael, father of the sons of Alca, I will speak for all. 
The monsters are oftenest found in caverns, by the brinks of waters, and, in preference, among pagan peoples. 
VIII. THE DRAGON OF ALCA (Continuation) Following the counsel of the holy Mael the inhabitants of Alca endeavoured to uproot the superstitions that had sprung up amongst them. 
They took care to prevent the girls from dancing with incantations round the fairy tree. Young mothers were sternly forbidden to rub their children against the stones that stood upright in the fields so as to make them strong. 
A woman with child who saw the shadow of a dragon on the road through a window in the moonlight, was so terrified that she was brought to bed before her time. 
A dragon guarded at Colchis the golden fleece that Jason conquered from him. 
A dragon watched over the golden apples in the garden of the Hesperides. 
"Thou shalt sing psalms and canticles and thou shalt say: "O sons of the Penguins, if there be among you a pure virgin, let her arise and go, armed with the sign of the cross, to combat the dragon!" 
The next day he girded up his loins and set out with two of his companions to proclaim to the inhabitants of Alca that a virgin alone would be able to deliver the Penguins from the rage of the dragon. 
At the hour when Venus lightens in the pale sky, whilst Kraken scattered terror through the villages, she used to visit in his moving hut, a young shepherd of Dalles called Marcel, whose pleasing form was invested with inexhaustible vigour. 
"It is certain that dragons laid waste the earth in ancient times and some have been seen as large as mountains. 
He sighed and brother Regimental sighed too. 
At the old man's words Samuel cast down his head and did not answer. 
Who will save us from his look?" 
They did not agree about his form and his figure, but all now united in saying that he was not as big as they had thought, and that his height was not much greater than a man's. 
When in the gloomy twilight I threw it over my shoulders no inhabitant of this island had courage to withstand its sight. 
Women and children, young men and old men fled distracted at its approach, and I carried terror among the whole race of Penguins. 
"Woman," asked Kraken, "what are your plans?" 
And the fair Orberosia informed her husband that the monks were going through the villages teaching the inhabitants the best way of combating the dragon; that, according to their instructions, the beast would be overcome by a virgin, and that if a maid placed her girdle around the dragon's neck she could lead him as easily as if he were a little dog. 
Now, Kraken, I have determined to answer their call. 
"Can you not try and understand me before you get angry?" sighed the fair Orberosia with deep though gentle contempt. And she explained the cunning designs that she had formed. 
The next day in the greaseladen atmosphere of the cavern, Kraken plaited a deformed skeleton out of osier rods and covered it with bristling, scaly, and filthy skins. 
"Do you speak truth, woman? 
The monk Regimental drew near: "That will," said he, "be the best proof. 
Pliny tells us in his history that its signs are either imaginary or very uncertain. 
One who bears upon her the fourteen signs of corruption may yet be pure in the eyes of the angels, and, on the contrary, another who has been pronounced pure by the matrons who inspected her may know that her good appearance is due to the artifices of a cunning perversity. 
For I tell thee that the noble Kraken, who was believed to be dead, will return among the Penguins and he shall slay the dragon. 
At his appearance the crowd drew back in terror. 
Several Penguins, seeing the dragon disembowelled, rushed forward to cut him to pieces, some from a feeling of rage and vengeance, others to get the magic stone called dragonite, that is engendered in his head. 
And the crowd of people dispersed, full of joy, singing hymns and canticles. 
At her death she became the object of public veneration, and was admitted into the calendar of the saints and adopted as the patron saint of Penguinia. 
We do not even know how to pronounce or write it. 
The devil entertained a great grudge against him, and attempted several times to lead him into temptation. 
One summer night he approached the queen, who slept upon her couch, showed her an image of the young monk whom she saw every day in the wooden monastery, and upon this image he placed a spell. 
With impatience and grief she resented his not looking at her. 
One of them, Draco the Great, attained great renown as a man of war. 
In twenty years he burned down more than a hundred thousand hamlets, market towns, unwalled towns, villages, walled towns, cities, and universities. 
As if strengthened by a longer sojourn in heaven, the blessed Orberosia now performed still greater miracles for those who came to lay their offerings on her tomb. She gave hopes to women who had been hitherto barren, she sent dreams to reassure jealous old men concerning the fidelity of the young wives whom they had suspected without cause, and she protected the country from plagues, murrains, famines, tempests, and dragons of Cappadocia. 
Warn the inhabitants of the country that if they allow my memory to be blotted out, and leave my tomb without honour and wealth, a new dragon will come and devastate Penguinia." 
In consequence, the odoriferous relics of that virgin were carried with great pomp to the metropolitan church and placed in the middle of the choir in a shrine made of gold and enamel and ornamented with precious stones. 
In the midst of the general ignorance, the monks in the shadow of their cloister devoted themselves to study, and copied the Holy Scriptures with indefatigable zeal. 
The splendour of the truth in those times illumined all souls that had not been corrupted by sophisms. 
They are so badly formed that for the most part it is impossible not merely to say what they are, but even to distinguish them from the splashes of ink with which they are plentifully interspersed. 
The narration is rapid and of a conciseness that sometimes approaches dryness. The reflections are rare and, as a rule, judicious. 
But the Porpoises claim that their artists were undoubtedly the instructors and masters of the Penguins. 
It is difficult to form an opinion on the matter, because the Penguins, before they began to admire their primitive painters, destroyed all their works. 
The Exhibition of French Primitives at the Pavilion Marsan in 1904 contained several little panels contemporary with the later Valois kings and with Henry IV. I have made many journeys to see the pictures of the brothers Van Eyck, of Memling, of Roger van der Weyden, of the painter of the death of Mary, of Ambrogio Lorenzetti, and of the old Umbrian masters. 
From this it follows that his colouring has more vivacity than harmony. 
There was born in the nineteenth century, in the biblical villages and reformed cottages of pious England, a multitude of little Samuels and little St. Johns, with hair curling like lambs, who, about 1840, and 1850, became spectacled professors and founded the cult of the primitives. 
He noticed in the studio a freshly painted Madonna, which, although severe and rigid, nevertheless, by a certain exactness in the proportions and a devilish mingling of light and shade, assumed an appearance of relief and life. 
Evening was hanging its purple folds from the arches of the cloisters and in a voice of emotion I was murmuring the verses which describe how Dido, the Phoenician queen, wanders with her everbleeding wound beneath the myrtles of hell. 
It is thus he pierced through a mountain near Naples and fashioned a bronze horse that had power to heal all the diseases of horses. 
I resumed the delightful study of my poet. 
Beyond them open two ways. That to the left leads to Tartarus, the abode of the wicked. I took that to the right, which leads to Elysium and to the dwellings of Dis. 
Of lofty stature, though spare, he still preserved that swarthy complexion, that rustic air, that negligent bearing, and unpolished appearance which during his lifetime concealed his genius. 
I made my profession in the Abbey of Corrigan. 
On earth the learned often dispute about it. 
I was instructed by philosophers and men of science and I had a correct foreboding of the truth. 
That would not seem right amongst you. 
A poet must not be asked to attach himself too strictly to any scientific or moral doctrine. Moreover, I am a Roman, and the Romans, unlike the Greeks, are unable to pursue profound speculations in a subtle manner. If they adopt a philosophy it is above all in order to derive some practical advantages from it. 
I have learnt from the Alexandrines how the earth, at first soft and without form, hardened in proportion as Nereus withdrew himself from it to dig his humid dwellings; I have learned how things were formed insensibly; in what manner the rains, falling from the burdened clouds, nourished the silent forests, and by what progress a few animals at last began to wander over the nameless mountains. 
"I have received none." 
That artifice did not seem ingenious to me; but it is not for the dead to judge of novelties. "But I do not reproach this colonist of Sulla, born in an unhappy time, for making inharmonious verses or for being, if it be possible, as bad a poet as Bavius or Maevius. I have grievances against him which touch me more closely. 
This news would give me some pleasure if one could rejoice in these abodes where we feel neither fears nor desires." 
Now he heard one of the sturgeons say to the other: "The man in the moon, whom we have often seen carrying fagots on his shoulders, has fallen into the sea." 
An obscure canon called Princeteau, a very austere and crabbed man, designated so great a number of them as not worthy of having their days observed, that he was surnamed the exposer of the saints. 
Such a statement is hardly credible, but the history of Orberosia, as it has since been related, seems hardly more worthy of belief. 
This is true of the Penguin nation, as of all other nations. Save for this exception its history is admirable from beginning to end." 
They will repent of it." 
We will say that they are the relics of St. Orberosia and that we have saved them from the flames at the peril of our lives. 
On that same day Mother Rouquin took home with her a little ashes and some bones, and put them in an old jampot in her cupboard. 
They had not long to wait. 
In the enthusiasm of victory the renovated Penguins delivered themselves up to a dragon, more terrible than that of their fables, who, like a stork amongst frogs, devoured them for fourteen years with his insatiable beak. 
As great in his defeats as in his victories he surrendered all that he had conquered. 
"Glory never costs too much," replied my guide. 
He bore such names as Paturle, Janvion, Traffaldin, Coquenhot, and Bredouille. These magistrates did not make war. 
The doctor was brought into the hall and cast his looks upon the crowd of legislators who were sitting on cane chairs with their feet upon their desks. 
"He is a pig merchant." 
"I put the proposition to the vote." 
And all the other monks, his brethren, thought the same. 
True, to plot the death of the new government was a difficult and perilous enterprise. 
The sons of the ancient families did not practise the arts or engage in business. 
One July as he was walking in a suburban street which ended in some dusty fields, Agaric heard groans coming from a mossgrown well that had been abandoned by the gardeners. 
And almost immediately he was told by a cobbler of the neighbourhood that a ragged man who had shouted out "Hurrah for the Republic!" had been thrown into the well by some cavalry officers who were passing, and had sunk up to his ears in the mud. 
His eyes had rubycoloured pupils like a guineapig's. 
Agaric made a gesture of refusal. 
"Alas!" sighed Cornemuse. 
The Republic is sunk in shame. 
"We can," he cried, "save the Penguin people, we can deliver it from its tyrants, deliver it from itself, restore the Dragon's crest, reestablish the ancient State, the good State, for the honour of the faith and the exaltation of the Church. 
We have more people on our side than we need. 
But reflect on it, we are Christians before we are Penguins. 
And we must take heed not to compromise religion in political enterprises." 
Agaric replied eagerly: "Fear nothing. 
The Republic fails in respect and submission to us; it does not give the priests the honours it owes them. 
But it lets us live. 
He pointed him to a prompt, certain, dazzling success. 
"Cornemuse," thought he, "not being able to prevent the plot, would like to make it succeed and he will give money." 
You can take one of these young ladies on your knee." 
His voice, coming from behind one of the ladies, expressed this thought: "We must have money, a great deal of money." 
Crucho had received a truly princely education, and he excelled in motoring, but was not ignorant of history either. 
During the evening Agaric had a decisive interview with three of the prince's oldest councillors. 
III. THE CABAL After his return to the capital of Penguinia, the Reverend Father Agaric disclosed his projects to Prince Adelestan des Boscenos, of whose Draconian sentiments he was well aware. 
They met together one night in the Duke of Ampoule's country house, six miles eastward of Alca, to consider ways and means. 
"We ought to keep within the law," said he in substance. 
The Prince des Boscenos expressed a contrary opinion. 
He was envious of sovereign power, not because he felt himself capable of exercising it, but because he loved to appear so. 
If we act openly we shall only cause alarm. 
It is known that we are not favourable to the present order. 
We must have recourse to a friend of the Republic, and, if we are to do what is best, to a defender of this government. 
If you need me you will find me at your disposal." 
So I very willingly undertook to convey a message to you." 
He esteems and appreciates you. 
What I have to tell you, the message with which I am entrusted, refers precisely to..." 
"It is his colours which Crucho sends you." 
Chatillon, the hero of the Penguins! 
"No, indeed," answered Chatillon. 
During his martial and neptunian life he had loved crowds of women, red, black, yellow, and white, and some of them had been very beautiful. But before he met the Viscountess he did not know what a woman really was. 
The police, who were assembled in great numbers, blocked the alley and compelled the Dracophils to disperse in little groups. 
Among these latter, in the darkness, his lofty figure rising above the moving crowd, his broad shoulders and robust body noticeable among the trampled limbs and crushed sides of the rest, stood the Prince des Boscenos, calm, immovable, and placid. 
"You see we shall soon be able to go out," said that kindly giant, with a pleasant smile. 
After having remained isolated from each other for a long time, without help and without support, they had formed themselves into unions. 
The coffers of the unions were empty, as it was not the habit of the unionists to pay their subscriptions. 
The song became popular, for the detectives reported that every day showed an increase of the number of workpeople who sang through the slums: J'ai du bon pognon; Tu n'l'auras pas Chatillon! 
"I have proofs," sighed the monk of Conils, "that the Duke of Ampoule, the treasurer of the Dracophils, has brought property in Porpoisia with the funds that he received for the propaganda." 
The party wanted money. 
Prince des Boscenos had lost his portfolio in a brawl and he was reduced to painful expedients which were repugnant to his impetuous character. 
But very few of them were inclined to purchase these benefits at the price of a social catastrophe and the overthrow of the public credit; and there were fewer still who would have risked their money, their peace, their liberty, or a single hour from their pleasures in the business. 
As for the government, it showed the weakness, indecision, flabbiness, and heedlessness common to all governments, and from which none has ever departed without falling into arbitrariness and violence. 
The rising was conquered. But Prince des Boscenos, standing on the wall of the hostile palace, his flag in his hand, still repelled the attack of a whole brigade. He knocked down all who approached him. 
The Ministers were embarrassed. 
But they knew nothing; they remained in that total ignorance reserved for those who govern men. 
They were incapable of advancing any grave charges against Chatillon. 
Chatillon's share in the plot and his relations with Prince Crucho remained the secret of the thirty thousand Dracophils. 
The Minister paid close attention. 
The prince approached the Minister's carriage and said in a loud voice: "Death to the Republicans!" 
When his projects were sufficiently ripe he went one day to the Wood of Conils. 
His shining head was no longer pleasant to the sight; perspiration and inflamed blotches bad altered its inestimable perfection. 
Some, however, have struck me. 
"You suffer from the persecution," said Agaric. 
Chatillon was a fool; he has drowned himself in his own ineptitude. 
Penguinia is ours. 
But without listening further, the monk of Conils drew in his head and closed his window. 
What an infamous piece of treachery! 
He had a vigorous and undisguised hatred for the Jews, and he worked in public and in private, night and day, for the restoration of the line of the Draconides. 
He was a man of resolute character. 
"My congratulations, Greatauk. 
People will read this evening about Pyrot's arrest in every newspaper in Alca ...." 
Have Pyrot arrested at once." 
Now the Penguin State was democratic. Three or four financial companies exercised a more extensive, and above all, more effective and continuous power, than that of the Ministers of the Republic. The latter were puppets whom the companies ruled in secret, whom they compelled by intimidation or corruption to favour themselves at the expense of the State, and whom they ruined by calumnies in the press if they remained honest. 
There was in Western Penguinia a seaport called La Cirque, formed of three small bays and formerly greatly frequented by ships, but now solitary and deserted. Gloomy lagoons stretched along its low coasts exhaling a pestilent odour, while fever hovered over its sleepy waters. 
In the times of the Draconides the Inquisitors of Alca used to put heretical clergy into this cage. 
But Pyrot's protests moved nobody because his confessions had been published. 
The seven hundred Pyrotists set to work with as much zeal as prudence, and made the most thorough inquiries in secret. 
"Vile dogs," he wrote to them in a famous letter, "you have crucified my God and you want my life too; I warn you that I will not be such a duffer as He was and that I will cut off your fourteen hundred ears. 
The Chief of the Government at the time was a peasant called Robin Mielleux, a man pleasant to the rich and powerful, but hard towards the poor, a man of small courage and ignorant of his own interests. 
He met with no hindrance while posting his bills in the quiet streets, but when he came to the populous quarters, every time he mounted his ladder, inquisitive people crowded round him and, dumbfounded with surprise and indignation, threw at him threatening looks which he received with the calm that comes from courage and shortsightedness. 
This torrent of vulgar humanity swept along the streets and rushed into the Rue St. Mael. 
Feelings grew warm and the ferment lasted the whole day. 
The patriots snatched whole bundles of the memorandum from the newsboys and burned them in the public squares, dancing wildly round these bonfires with girls whose petticoats were tied up to their waists. 
In the august silence of the assembly he pronounced these words only: "I swear that Pyrot is a rascal." 
V. THE REVEREND FATHERS AGARIC AND CORNEMUSE Colomban bore with meekness and surprise the weight of the general reprobation. He could not go out without being stoned, so he did not go out. 
They broached the subject to their friends and endeavoured to spread the light that had arisen in their minds. 
Another demanded explanations in an open letter to the Minister of War. 
A third published a terrible pamphlet. The latter, whose name was Kerdanic, was a formidable controversialist. 
The misfortunes of the Penguin Church had not disheartened him. He remained faithful to Prince Crucho and preserved the hope of restoring the heir of the Draconides to the Penguin throne. 
But none the less my industry remains uncertain and precarious. 
Everywhere disobedience, independence, liberty! 
"Everybody will be too many," murmured the monk of Conils, shaking his head. 
In these circumstances the Prince des Boscenos thought it urgent to curb their audacity and repress their insolence. For this purpose he joined with Count Clena, M. de La Trumelle, Viscount Olive, and M. Bigourd in founding a great antiPyrotist association to which citizens in hundreds of thousands, soldiers in companies, regiments, brigades, divisions, and army corps, towns, districts, and provinces, all gave their adhesion. 
The door was open, and Greatauk saw coming up the staircase a long file of porters who were unloading heavy bales of papers in the hall, and he saw the lift slowly rising heavily loaded with paper packets. 
It was limpid; like a rockcrystal its value lay in its transparency. 
I advise you, Panther, to use your paper packets with great reserve. 
At last the police, who had been sent after them, attacked and defeated them and dragged them ignominiously to the station, where Bazile, under the name of Colomban, was trampled on by an innumerable quantity of thick, hobnailed shoes. 
That image did not leave him. 
He went in. The meeting was disorderly; they were yelling, abusing one another and knocking one another down in the smokeladen hall. 
They gravely accused the courtesan and the astronomer of being spies, of treachery, and of plotting against their country. 
"It is proposed that you act the part of the police for your enemies, and that you are to reestablish for them the order which their own crimes have disturbed. 
That is not a motive to make the people brave all dangers in his defence. 
As for me, my choice is made. I am for revolutionary justice as against social justice. 
I say that when a lucky chance brings us an affair like this we should be fools not to profit by it. 
Those qualities of verdure, softness, and aroma, are those of our national hay. 
LieutenantColonel Hastaing said in the witnessbox, amid hisses, that he did not believe Pyrot guilty. 
Colomban, pronounced guilty without any extenuating circumstances, was condemned to the severest penalty. 
The seven hundred Pyrotists disguised as lemonade sellers, uttermerchants, collectors of odds and ends, or antiPyrotists, wandered round the vast building. 
There were some cries of "Justice and truth!" and a voice was even heard shouting: "Down with the Army!" 
Colomban seemed to be saved; his partisans succeeded in clearing a passage for him through the Place du Palais and in putting him into a cab stationed at the corner of the PontVieux. 
He got up and approached the unhappy animal. 
Father Agaric was in the apse with the teachers and pupils of St. Mael College. 
The righthand transept and aisle were reserved for officers and soldiers in uniform, this side being thought the more honourable, since the Lord leaned his head to the right when he died on the Cross. 
Hurrah for Crucho!" and all of them, monks, women, soldiers, noblemen, citizens, and loafers, who were gathered beneath the superhuman arm uplifted in the pulpit, struck up the hymn, "Let us save Penguinia!" 
They rushed impetuously from the basilica and marched along the quays to the Chamber of Deputies. 
The attack which the crowd made upon the legislative palace was repulsed. 
MM. de La Trumelle and d'Ampoule were taken to the police station. 
These were spectacles of which cool reason cannot approve and they were fit causes for grief to the municipal authorities, who desired to preserve the good order of the roads and streets. But, what was sadder for a man of heart was the sight or the canting humbugs, who, from fear of blows, kept at an equal distance from the two camps, and who, although they allowed their selfishness and cowardice to be visible, claimed admiration for the generosity of their sentiments and the nobility of their souls. They rubbed their eyes with onions, gaped like whitings, blew violently into their handkerchiefs, and, bringing their voices out of the depths of their stomachs, groaned forth: "O Penguins, cease these fratricidal struggles; cease to rend your mother's bosom!" 
"I cannot sleep on account of it!" was what several members of Minister Guillaumette's majority used to say. But these were ambitious to replace their chief. 
Too many indiscreet looks have already profaned her charms.... 
Peniche, his Minister of War, refused them in the superior interests of the national defence, telling him that the documents under General Panther's care formed the hugest mass of archives in the world. 
Pyrot was the cause of it. 
In the mean time the Pyrot case, having been presented to the Supreme Court by the Keeper of Seals, it fell to Chaussepied to examine it and cover its defects, in case any existed. 
Before those present could understand what was happening, the general seized her by the wrist, and with apparent gentleness, squeezed it so forcibly that the knife fell from her aching hand. 
The second conviction of Pyrot was Greatauk's last victory. 
He rehabilitated Pyrot a second time; he would, if necessary, have rehabilitated him five hundred times. 
The victorious defenders of the innocent man now abused each other and overwhelmed each other reciprocally with insults and calumnies. The vehement Kerdanic hurled himself upon Phoenix as if ready to devour him. 
The ladies who went to see her, very different in age and rank, were all without money, and had all suffered much. 
All morality relative to the relations of the sexes is founded on this principle: that a woman once obtained belongs to the man, that she is his property like his horse or his weapons. 
It was in the choir of St. Mael's that St. Orberosia's new shrine, shining with gold, sparkling with precious stones, and surrounded by tapers and flowers, had been erected. 
An operatic tenor sang the famous canticle of St. Orberosia: Virgin of Paradise Come, come in the dusky night And on us shed Thy beams of light. 
He treated in his sermon of the seventh trial of St. Orberosia, who was tempted by the dragon which she went forth to combat. 
His father was said to have kept a dram shop, but he himself was a lawyer of robust physique, a good though prolix speaker, with a selfimportant air and a reputation for ability. 
But in order that the motor may cease to be injurious and become beneficent we must build roads suited to its speed, roads which it cannot tear up with its ferocious tyres, and from which it will send no clouds of poisonous dust into human lungs. 
"We build today in an admirable style," said he; "everywhere majestic avenues are being reared. 
"Are you not afraid," asked M. Ceres severely, "are you not afraid that these bitter criticisms tend to keep out of our capital the foreigners who flow into it from all arts of the world and who leave millions behind them?" "You may set your mind at rest about that," answered M. Daniset. 
It is indeed deplorable. But M. Leon Blum need not fret too much. If the evil exists, as he says it does, in our middleclass society, I can assure him that everywhere else he would see a consoling spectacle. 
Among the people, the mass of the people through town and country, girls do not deny themselves that pleasure." 
"It is depravity!" said Madame Cremeur. 
I myself have been met by this obstacle several times in my attempts at seduction." 
"For my part," said Hippolyte Ceres, looking at her, "I declare myself the young ladies' champion." 
He furnished Mademoiselle Clarence with several opportunities of appearing to great advantage and in particular at a garden party which, although given by a Minister, was regarded as really fashionable, and gained its first success in society circles for the Republic. 
A little moved, almost disquieted, she very nearly became the victim of her daring, and only avoided defeat by an offensive measure audaciously carried out. 
Henceforth, in spite of everything, she began to observe him with interest, being curious to see if his passion would increase. 
She still made fun of him, but he had now won her interest. 
"Stay a little longer," said she in a pressing and agreeable voice which made him promptly sit down again. 
She was, moreover, very reserved with him, and that not solely from any want of inclination to be otherwise, since in affairs of love some things are due to indifference, to inattention, to woman's instinct, to traditional custom and feeling, to a desire to try one's power, and to satisfaction at seeing its results. 
Clericalism was in his eyes a sign of good form. 
After a long hesitation Eveline Clarence accepted the idea of marrying M. Hippolyte Ceres. 
Then she became tender, weak, suppliant. 
Now that she is persecuted, the shadow of the crypts and the recesses of the catacombs are in better accord with her festivals. 
Hippolyte, although he thought the combination a little dangerous, agreed to it, a good deal flattered, at bottom. 
The bad side of their situation was that they had not much money; in truth they had very little. 
She had gained experience since her motor excursions with Viscount Clena, and above all she had now acquired the value of a married woman. 
The deputy was at first uneasy about these pious practices, which were ridiculed by the demagogic newspapers, but he was soon reassured, for he saw all around him democratic leaders joyfully becoming reconciled to the aristocracy and the Church. 
The President of the Republic entrusted the formation of a new Cabinet to this same Paul Visire, who, though still very young, had been a Minister twice. He was a charming man, spending much of his time in the greenrooms of theatres, very artistic, a great society man, of amazing ability and industry. 
Already whispers were heard of distant enterprises, and of planting colonies, and the boldest put forward in the newspapers the project of a military and financial protectorate over Nigritia. 
Madame Ceres was the charm of the Ministry and its tide to consideration. 
Beneath her white muslin dress her rounded yet slender form was outlined in its grace and youth. 
It is difficult to decide; and Professor Haddock, when the facts were divulged (which happened without much delay as we shall see), treated the matter from an experimental point of view, in a scientific review, and concluded that the chances Madame Cwould have of finding the exact equivalent of M. Vwere in the proportion of 305 to 975008. 
Hippolyte Ceres, without being either very subtle, or very perspicacious, noticed that there was something different in his home. Eveline, who quite lately had interested herself in his affairs, and shown, if not tenderness, at least affection, towards him, displayed henceforth nothing but indifference and repulsion. 
Hippolyte Ceres suffered all the tortures of jealousy. He admitted it to himself, he kept saying inwardly, "I am a strong man; I am clad in armour; but the wound is underneath, it is in my heart," and turning towards his wife, who looked beautiful in her guilt, he would say: "It ought not to have been with him." 
Nevertheless, he gave vent to outbursts of grief and rage that drove him insane; for whole days his reason abandoned him. 
Hippolyte Ceres informed them in a circular that their action was strictly legal. 
VIII. FURTHER CONSEQUENCES The session ended calmly, and the Ministry saw no dangerous signs upon the benches where the majority sat. 
Fortune Lapersonne had his own wound beneath his armour, His wife, a young milliner whom he carried off from a marquis, had gone to live with a chauffeur. 
Yes, to tell you of your nomination to the rank of officer of the Legion of Honour. 
I signed the patent this morning." 
Hippolyte Ceres asked them nothing further. 
A photograph of Madame Ceres in night attire buttoning her boots was the utmost that had been obtained. 
Hippolyte, adopting this method, inserted in the newspapers that he was always to be found in the company of Mademoiselle Guinaud of the Opera. 
He understood that he could only keep himself in office by a great political stroke, and he decided on the expedition to Nigritia. This measure was demanded by the great financial and industrial corporations and was one which would bring concessions of immense forests to the capitalists, a loan of eight millions to the banking companies, as well as promotions and decorations to the naval and military officers. 
It was too late. The very day of this fall the neighbouring and hostile nation recalled its ambassador and flung eight millions of men into Madame Ceres' country. 
And when we try to lead back these misguided souls, neither threats nor promises, neither gentleness nor violence, nor anything else is now successful. 
Not being able to conquer her passion, Cecile resolved to satisfy it. 
Then suspecting that she was shut up with a gallant, he struck great blows upon the door and began to shout 'Slut! hussy! wanton! open so that I may cut off your nose and ears!' 
She found him with the pretended niece sitting on his knee. She called him a debauched creature, boxed his ears, and forced him to beg her pardon. 
It had reached its zenith. 
One of his workmen, the victim of an accident while at work, being refused any indemnity by his employer, obtained a verdict in the courts, but repelled by innumerable obstacles of procedure, he fell into the direst poverty. Being thus reduced to despair, he succeeded by dint of cunning and audacity in confronting his employer with a loaded revolver in his hand, and threatened to blow out his brains if he did not give him some assistance. Samuel Box gave nothing, and let himself be killed for the sake of principle. 
Some felt the gravity of their position cruelly; but they endured it either from pride or from duty. 
Of low stature, with small heads and narrow chests, they were further distinguished from the comfortable classes by a multitude of physiological anomalies, and, in particular, by a common want of symmetry between the head and the limbs. 
And they were destined to a gradual and continuous degeneration, for the State made soldiers of the more robust among them, and the health of these did not long withstand the brothels and the drinkshops that sprang up around their barracks. 
The alternations of production inherent in the capitalist system caused such cessations of work that, in several branches of industry, as soon as a strike was declared, the accumulation of products allowed the employers to dispense with the strikers. 
Terrible accidents, henceforth periodical and regular, entered into people's calculations, and kept mounting higher and higher in statistical tables. 
This square was the healthiest place in the capital; here no smoke obscured the sky, and children were brought here to play. 
Fair, thin, and supple, he had features of a feminine delicacy; he was scarcely older than she, and looked still younger. 
This is an awful horse, he has got the bit between his teeth." 
The bewilderment was great, for although accidents were common, such a violent explosion as this one had never been seen, and everybody perceived that something terribly strange had happened. 
At last she whispered in his ear: "Did you know it? 
On the following day the Southern Railway Station, the Petroleum Trust, and the huge church built at the expense of Thomas Morcellet were all blown up. Thirty houses were in flames, and the beginning of a fire was discovered at the docks. 
Many who were anxious to lay in a stock of provisions and take refuge in the cellars, attacked the grocery stores, although they were guarded by soldiers with fixed bayonets. 
Some of them performed their duty with heroic simplicity. 
The ordinary helpers of the rich, the clerks, employees, brokers, and agents, preserved an unshaken fidelity. 
Soon the stench from the corpses became intolerable. 
A hundred and one days after the first outrage, whilst six army corps with field artillery and siege artillery were marching, at night, into the poorest quarter of the city, Caroline and Clair, holding each other's hands, were watching from the roof a lofty house, the only one still left standing, but now surrounded by smoke and flame, joyous songs ascended from the street, where the crowd was dancing in delirium. 
Later, becoming the capital of a great State, it found itself straitened within its now useless ramparts and it converted them into grasscovered walks. 
When we have lunched we will return to that place." 
"What?" cried I. "You are going to play again?" 
"What else do you suppose?" she retorted. "Are you going only to sit here, and grow sour, and let me look at you?" 
The meal over, Theodosia and Martha broke into a joint flood of ecstasy. 
But reason goes for little on such occasions. 
Truly he was cutting a pitiful figure! 
Once, twice, and thrice I did so, yet zero never turned up. 
The red turned up, but zero missed again, and we only got our thousand gulden back. 
By the fifth round, however, the Grandmother was weary of the scheme. 
Stake four thousand gulden upon the red." 
"Stake again, stake againeight thousand at a stroke!" 
"A mere trifle." "But there is a moneychanger's office here, is there not? 
But you will lose on the transaction what would frighten even a Jew." 
"Yes, one of the clerks. 
"You talk sheer nonsense, for, though you keep on saying 'Madame, Madame,' you haven't the least notion what ought to be done. 
Deeply offended, De Griers shrugged his shoulders, favoured the Grandmother with a look of contempt, and departed. 
Arrived at the hotel, she called for tea, and then gave orders for her luggage to be packed. 
My God!" And Potapitch spat upon his handsprobably to show that he was ready to serve her in any way he could. 
What are YOU finicking for?" 
"Away with you! Clear them out of the room, Alexis Ivanovitch. 
Yes, I know all about the sending of the telegrams to inquire whether 'the old woman is likely to turn up her toes soon.' Ah, they were looking for the legacies! 
Will you come with me or will you not?" 
If you would let me have, say, a couple of weeks to decide in?" 
But if, Grandmamma, you would take the little ones AND myself, then, of course, I could come with you, and would do all I could to serve you" (this she said with great earnestness). 
"With your leave, Madame," I said, "I will not go with you." 
Twice she caught him at it, and rated him soundly. On one occasion she even pulled his hair, so that the bystanders burst out laughing. 
So dear to me is the formless dream of which I have spoken, so dear to me are the impressions which it has left behind it, that I fear to touch the vision with anything new, lest it should dissolve in smoke. 
In other words, on learning that the old lady had changed her mind about departing, and was bent on setting out for the Casino again, the whole of our gang (Polina only excepted) proceeded en masse to her rooms, for the purpose of finally and frankly treating with her. 
Later in the morning he held several consultations with De Griersthe question which occupied him being: Is it in any way possible to make use of the policeto tell them that "this respected, but unfortunate, old lady has gone out of her mind, and is squandering her last kopeck," or something of the kind? 
On a thousand occasions I had challenged her to be open with me, nor could she have been ignorant that I was ready to give my very life for her. 
Clearly the General was almost out of his mind with joy, for he was talking all sorts of nonsense, and bubbling over with a longdrawn, nervous laugha laugh which twisted his face into innumerable wrinkles, and caused his eyes almost to disappear. 
Fortunately, the poor General did not know that his fate had been decidedthat Mlle. had long ago packed her trunks in readiness for the first morning train to Paris! 
"If I am here, I have come with all that I have to bring," she said. 
Having lost, however, almost the whole of my money in debts incurred by your stepfather, I find myself driven to the necessity of saving the remainder; wherefore, I have instructed certain friends of mine in St. Petersburg to arrange for the sale of all the property which has been mortgaged to myself. 
Nor," she added hotly, "will I go down upon my knees to ANY ONE." 
Never before had she addressed me thus. Then her head must have turned dizzy with emotion, for suddenly she seated herself upon the sofa, as though she were powerless any longer to stand. 
Whether by this there is connoted something in the nature of a combination of presentiments, or a great effort of will, or a selfannulment of one's true expectations, and so on, I do not know; but, at all events that night saw happen to me (a night which I shall never forget) something in the nature of the miraculous. 
"Passe" was a row of numbers from 19 to 36 inclusive; while a row of numbers from 1 to 18 inclusive was known as "Manque." But what had that to do with me? 
I had not noticedI had not so much as heard the numbers upon which the previous coup had fallen, and so took no bearings when I began to play, as, in my place, any SYSTEMATIC gambler would have done. 
Next, I moved the whole eighty on to twelve middle numbers (a stake which, if successful, would bring me in a triple profit, but also involved a risk of two chances to one). The wheel revolved, and stopped at twentyfour. 
Once more, with the addition of my original stake, I was in possession of six thousand florins! 
Since my entry not more than half an hour could have elapsed. 
Suddenly a croupier informed me that I had, won thirty thousand florins, as well as that, since the latter was the limit for which, at any one time, the bank could make itself responsible, roulette at that table must close for the night. 
At the moment, I was stuffing the crumpled banknotes into my pockets and collecting all the gold that was left on the table. 
At this distance of time I cannot remember whether I ever gave a thought to Polina; I seemed only to be conscious of a vague pleasure in seizing and raking in the banknotes which kept massing themselves in a pile before me. 
If the spirit has passed through a great many sensations, possibly it can no longer be sated with them, but grows more excited, and demands more sensations, and stronger and stronger ones, until at length it falls exhausted. 
Certainly, if the rules of the game had permitted even of my staking fifty thousand florins at a time, I should have staked them. 
What? 
"You are a bold young fellow," one said, "but mind you depart early tomorrowas early as you canfor if you do not you will lose everything that you have won." 
Also, I cannot remember what I thought about on the way. 
Consequently, for a moment or two Polina escaped my mind. 
He says he intends to go to the North Pole for scientific investigations, and has invited me to go with him! 
"How absurd you looked when you were talking to the Burmergelms! 
Yet I neither saw nor heard her, for my head was in a whirl.... 
Judge, therefore, of my surprise when, meeting the domestic on the stairs, she informed me that Polina had not yet returned, and that she (the domestic) was at that moment on her way to my room in quest of her! 
"Mlle. left me but ten minutes ago," I said. "What can have become of her?" 
Already sundry rumours were flying about the hotel. 
As yet it was early for Mr. Astley to receive visitors; but, as soon as he learnt that it was I who had arrived, he came out into the corridor to meet me, and stood looking at me in silence with his steelgrey eyes as he waited to hear what I had to say. 
Tell me if it is true that, last night, you won two hundred thousand thalers?" "No; I won a hundred thousand florins." 
Moreover, Mlle. Polina has a perfect right to live where she chooses. 
"I suppose he means to shoot me in a duel, should Polina die. Yes, that is what he intends to do." 
Yes, I can say that now; although, at the time, I was barely conscious of it. 
But presently I was to go through an exceedingly strange and ugly experience. 
I returned to my own room with my head in a whirl. 
You know well enough that at about this hour every day he goes to buy me a bouquet. 
I spent a little over three weeks there, and, during that time, saw my hundred thousand francs come to an end. 
At these reunions I had to play the part of hostto meet and entertain fat mercantile parvenus who were impossible by reason of their rudeness and braggadocio, colonels of various kinds, hungry authors, and journalistic hacksall of whom disported themselves in fashionable tailcoats and pale yellow gloves, and displayed such an aggregate of conceit and gasconade as would be unthinkable even in St. Petersburgwhich is saying a great deal! 
This seemed to her so curious that straightway she seated herself by my side. 
My hundred thousand francs I look upon merely as a beginningas a mere drop in the bucket." 
Dis doncyou will end by making me love you. 
Mais tu es" "Yes, you are lying right enough. But what makes you suppose that I should be angry? Rubbish! 
One morning in particular, he started to sneer at me over our matutinal coffee. 
Even if he should not be so, he will not come amiss, since, in the first place, he has his pension, and, in the second place, he will be content to live in a back room; whereas I shall be Madame General, and get into a good circle of society" (she was always thinking of this) "and become a Russian chatelaine. 
At that time had I any doubts of myself ? 
What could you say to me that I do not already know? 
In my dilemma I had recourse to this Heintze, who was a young scapegrace, and the sort of man who could speak and write three languages. 
At first I acted as his secretary, at a salary of thirty gulden a month, but afterwards I became his lacquey, for the reason that he could not afford to keep a secretaryonly an unpaid servant. I had nothing else to turn to, so I remained with him, and allowed myself to become his flunkey. 
This left me with sixty gulden in silver. 
I went and hired a room, I shut myself up in it, and sat counting my money until three o'clock in the morning. 
Mr. Astley seemed to listen to me with a sort of surprise. 
At that time it was ages since I had last looked at a paper or turned the pages of a book. "You are growing blase," he said. 
Mlle. Blanche did well by him, for she succeeded in having transferred to herself all that he received from the Grandmother. 
And even though it may offend you, I feel bound to say that the majority also of English people are uncouth and unrefined, whereas we Russian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it, and are always eager to cultivate the same. 
But to distinguish beauty of soul and personal originality there is needed far more independence and freedom than is possessed by our women, especially by our younger ladies. At all events, they need more EXPERIENCE. 
She may respect you, she may become your friend, she may open out her heart to you; yet over that heart there will be reigning that loathsome villain, that mean and petty usurer, De Griers. 
I, again, am not even a sugar refiner; I am a mere roulette gambler who has also served as a lacquey. Of this fact Mlle. Polina is probably well aware, since she appears to have an excellent force of police at her disposal." 
But I am only wasting words." "Yes, you are, for you are only talking nonsense! exclaimed my companionhis voice now trembling and his eyes flashing fire. "Are you aware," he continued, "that wretched, ignoble, petty, unfortunate man though you are, it was at HER request I came to Homburg, in order to see you, and to have a long, serious talk with you, and to report to her your feelings and thoughts and hopesyes, and your recollections of her, too?" 
Is that really so?" I criedthe tears beginning to well from my eyes. Never before had this happened. 
Nor are you the first to learn what a taskmaster is yours. 
You are in want of money, I suppose? 
Yet WHY should I not rise from the dead? 
Well, I won the stake, and in twenty minutes had left the Casino with a hundred and seventy gulden in my pocket! 
That is a fact, and it shows what a last remaining gulden can do.... But what if my heart had failed me, or I had shrunk from making up my mind? ...

They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles' cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just been arrested. 
The police had never read an odder report. 
To everyone's surprise, and amid a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. 
Frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their parents and grandparents, though him a murderer. 
It was Frank's bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse than ever in his old age. 
He put down the kettle at once, hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door. 
This surprised him. 
This too belonged to a manbut it was strangely highpitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind. 
Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear. 
"You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail," said the second voice. 
I wonder...perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you, Wormtail? 
How am I to survive without you, when I need feeding every few hours? 
I have waited thirteen years. 
"You...are going...to kill me too?" 
I killed Bertha because I had to. 
He started making noises such as Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath. 
Wormtail beckoned Frank into the room. 
The fire was the only source of light in the room; it cast long, spidery shadows upon the walls. 
"I don't know what you mean by wizard," said Frank, his voice growing steadier. 
It was all becoming confused. 
It wasn't the pain that bothered him; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury. 
The same arm had been pierced by a venemous footlong fang not long afterward. 
Only last year Harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborn broomstick. 
Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went. 
It was due to Sirius that Harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him. 
Somehow, Harry found it hard to imaging dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight, perhapse that was why Sirius had gone South. 
Dear Sirius, Thanks for your last letter. 
That's a sort of computer thing you can play games on. 
A weird thing happened this morning, though. 
My scar hurt again. 
Then he got to his feet, stretched, and opened his wardrobe once more. 
Uncle Vernon's large red face was hidden behind the morning's Daily Mail, and Aunt Petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed over her horselike teeth. 
They also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report"He's a boisterous little boy, but he wouldn't hurt a fly!" Aunt Petunia had said tearfully. 
The diet sheet that had been sent by the Smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge, which had been emptied of all Dudley's favorite thingsfizzy drinks and cakes, chocolate bars and burgers and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that Uncle Vernon called "rabbit food." 
He noticed that it was a lot smaller than Dudley's. 
But Aunt Petunia didn't know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs. 
Bewildered, wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time, Harry got up and followed Uncle Vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room. 
"So," he said, marching over to the fireplace and turning to face Harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest. 
"This just arrived," said Uncle Vernon. 
Who would be writing to Uncle Vernon about him? 
As Harry might have told you, the final of the Quidditch World Cup takes place this Monday night, and my husband, Arthur, has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the Department of Magical Games and Sports. 
I do hope you will allow us to take Harry to the match, as this really is a onceinalifetime opportunity; Britain hasn't hosted the cup for thirty years, and tickets are extremely hard to come by. 
Allowing Harry to go would make Harry happy, something Uncle Vernon had struggled against for thirteen years. 
Uncle Vernon was perusing the letter again. 
Harry took a deep, steadying breath and then said, "Okay, I can't see the World Cup. 
"Okay then," said Harry brightly. 
He was going ... he was going to the Weasleys', he was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup! 
The first thing he saw was that Hedwig was back. 
He went back to the letter: We're coming for you whether the Muggles like it or not, you can't miss the World Cup, only Mum and Dad reckon it's better if we pretend to ask their permission first. 
Percy's started workthe Department of International Magical Cooperation. 
See you soonRon "Calm down!" Harry said as the small owl flew low over his head, twittering madly with what Harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person. 
Harry turned to Hedwig. 
His dad's got us tickets for the Quidditch World Cup! 
To some people, this might have looked like a gesture of welcome, but Harry knew it was because Uncle Vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating. 
But Mr. Weasley had borrowed a Ministry of Magic car last year; possibly he would do the same today? 
Finally, at a quarter to five, Harry went back downstairs and into the living room. 
I know," said Harry. 
"Maybe they think they'll get invited to dinner if they're late." 
"What is it?" gasped Aunt Petunia, who had backed into the wall and was staring, terrified, toward the fire. 
Stand back, Harry." 
Harry retreated to the sofa. 
"Ahyou must be Harry's aunt and uncle!" 
Muggle fireplaces aren't supposed to be connected, strictly speakingbut I've got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation Panel and he fixed it for me. 
I can put it right in a jiffy, though, don't worry. 
Harry was ready to bet that the Dursleys hadn't understood a single word of this. 
They were still gaping at Mr. Weasley, thunderstruck. 
Uncle Vernon's face purpled once more, and Aunt Petunia started chewing her tongue again. 
Mr. Weasley was looking around. 
Uncle Vernon clearly thought Mr. Weasley was mad too. 
"Yep," said Harry, "that's Dudley." 
They glanced around as they entered and spotted Dudley. Their faces cracked into identical evil grins. 
"See you," said Ron brightly to the Dursleys. 
"It doesn't matter," Harry muttered to Mr. Weasley. 
"You aren't going to see your nephew till next summer," he said to Uncle Vernon in mild indignation. 
Dudley was no longer standing behind his parents. 
Aunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside Dudley, seized the end of his swollen tongue, and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth; unsurprisingly, Dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever, trying to fight her off. 
Bellowing like a wounded hippo, Uncle Vernon snatched up another ornament. 
But next moment Harry had begun to spin very fast, and the Dursleys' living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of emeraldgreen flames. 
Harry spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to his sides, blurred fireplaces flashing past him, until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes. 
He had a broad, goodnatured face, which was weatherbeaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned; his arms were muscular, and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it. 
Then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind Mrs. Weasley. 
"You stay where you are!" snarled Mrs. Weasley. 
"Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George's room," said Ron quietly. 
"We've been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never thought they were actually making things," said Ginny. 
"We thought they just liked the noise." 
"Only, most of the stuffwell, all of it, reallywas a bit dangerous," said Ron, "and, you know, they were planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make some money, and Mum went mad at them. 
Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thinleakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year" "That'll change the world, that report will," said Ron. 
"Front page of the Daily Prophet, I expect, cauldron leaks." 
"There's just not room for eleven people in here. 
They left Mrs. Weasley and headed out the back door into the yard. 
Fred and George were cheering, Ginny was laughing, and Hermione was hovering near the hedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiety. 
By seven o'clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of Mrs. Weasley's excellent cooking, and the nine Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear, deepblue sky. 
"Oh Bagman's likable enough, of course," said Percy dismissively, "but how he ever got to be Head of Department ... when I compare him to Mr. Crouch! 
Mr. Crouch has been taking a personal interest, she worked in our department at one time, you know, and I think Mr. Crouch was quite fond of herbut Bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in Australia instead of Albania. 
"The topsecret one." 
Ron rolled his eyes and muttered to Harry and Hermione, "He's been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work. 
"I like it," said Ginny, who was sitting beside Bill. 
He sounds okay. 
He might write back while I'm here." 
"That was a sample of fertilizer from Norway!" said Percy, going very red in the face. 
At the foot of Harry's mattress he saw two large, disheveled shapes emerging from tangles of blankets. 
"Well, they're Apparating, aren't they?" said Mrs. Weasley, heaving the large pot over to the table and starting to ladle porridge into bowls. 
"Yes, well, he passed the second time," said Mrs. Weasley, marching back into the kitchen amid hearty sniggers. 
Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at George's pocket and said, "Accio!" 
"We told you to get rid of the lot! 
Accio!" she shouted, and toffees zoomed from all sorts of unlikely places, including the lining of George's jacket and the turnups of Fred's jeans. 
"Oh a fine way to spend six months!" she shrieked. 
So we had to find a nice deserted moor, and set up as many antiMuggle precautions as possible. 
"Unobtrusive things, obviously, so Muggles don't go picking them up and playing with them ... stuff they'll just think is litter...." 
They had only been at it for a couple of minutes, however, when a shout rent the still air. 
"This is Amos Diggory, everyone," said Mr. Weasley. 
And I think you know his son, Cedric?" 
You beat Harry Potter!" 
"Not on duty, eh? 
It's all right for some.... 
Hang on, I'll find your campsite.... 
Diggory ... second field ... ask for Mr. Payne." 
"Ah yes, so it is.... 
"Is that right?" said Mr. Weasley, his hand held out for his change, but Mr. Roberts didn't give it to him. 
Most looked almost ordinary; their owners had clearly tried to make them as Mugglelike as possible, but had slipped up by adding chimneys, or bellpulls, or weather vanes. 
Halfway up the field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace, with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance. 
Nobody looking at these tents would guess they belonged to wizards, Harry thought, but the trouble was that once Bill, Charlie, and Percy arrived, they would be a party of ten. 
"We'll be a bit cramped," he called, "but I think we'll all squeeze in. 
"Well, why don't you, Harry, and Hermione go and get us some water then"Mr. Weasley handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans"and the rest of us will get some wood for a fire?" 
A tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramidshaped tent, holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami. 
As they drew level with him, his mother came hurrying out of the tent. 
You don'ttouchDaddy'swandyecchh! " 
They had walked into a patch of tents that were all covered with a thick growth of shamrocks, so that it looked as though small, oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth. 
He was sitting in front of his own shamrockcovered tent, with a sandyhaired woman who had to be his mother, and his best friend, Dean Thomas, also of Gryffindor. 
The picture was, of course, moving, but all it did was blink and scowl. 
"Who cares what he looks like? 
He's a genius, you wait until tonight, you'll see." 
It made his ears shrivel up." 
"You've not got that fire started yet?" 
Mr. Weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire, but it wasn't for lack of trying. 
Splintered matches littered the ground around him, but he looked as though he was having the time of his life. 
A cloudless night coming ... and hardly a hiccough in the arrangements.... 
Bagman did the smallest of double takes when he heard Harry's name, and his eyes performed the familiar flick upward to the scar on Harry's forehead. 
"Oh ... go on then," said Mr. Weasley. 
"You don't want to go showing Mr. Bagman rubbish like that," Percy hissed, but Bagman didn't seem to think the wand was rubbish at all; on the contrary, his boyish face shone with excitement as he took it from Fred, and when the wand gave a loud squawk and turned into a rubber chicken, Bagman roared with laughter. 
I'm keeping an eye out for Barty Crouch. 
"All you have to do is point and grunt." 
"Any news of Bertha Jorkins yet, Ludo?" Mr. Weasley asked as Bagman settled himself down on the grass beside them all. 
Poor old Bertha ... memory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction. 
Ohtalk of the devil! 
Barty Crouch was a stiff, upright, elderly man, dressed in an impeccably crisp suit and tie. 
"I've been looking for you everywhere. 
"So, been keeping busy, Barty?" said Bagman breezily. 
"See you all later!" he said. 
"It's classified information, until such time as the Ministry decides to release it," said Percy stiffly. 
"Mr. Crouch was quite right not to disclose it." 
A sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over the campsite as the afternoon wore on. 
"Omnioculars," said the saleswizard eagerly. 
"It's time!" said Mr. Weasley, looking as excited as any of them. 
Everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light, which seemed to come from the stadium itself. 
The Bluebottle: A Broom for All the Familysafe, reliable, and with Builtin AntiBurgler Buzzer ... 
Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never actually met him. 
"Winky is wishing she is back in master's tent, Harry Potter, but Winky does what she is told. Winky is a good houseelf." 
Ah, I see his houseelf's saving him a seat.... 
"Good lord, Arthur," he said softly. 
Surely your house wouldn't have fetched this much?" 
The Malfoys prided themselves on being purebloods; in other words, they considered anyone of Muggle descent, like Hermione, secondclass. 
"Ready when you are, Ludo," said Fudge comfortably. 
The righthand side of the stands, which was a solid block of scarlet, roared its approval. 
Something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it"Excellent!" yelled Ron as the shamrock soared over them, and heavy gold coins rained from it, bouncing off their heads and seats. 
Squinting up at the shamrock, Harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests, each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green. 
A second scarletrobed player zoomed out. 
Viktor Krum was thin, dark, and sallowskinned, with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows. 
"And now, please greetthe Irish National Quidditch Team!" yelled Bagman. 
With a sharp blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into the air after the balls. 
Back to Mullet! 
PORSKOFF PLOY flashed up next, as Troy made as though to dart upward with the Quaffle, drawing away the Bulgarian Chaser Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to Moran. 
Volkov and Vulchanov, the Bulgarian Beaters, were whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the Irish Chasers, and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves; twice they were forced to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to break through their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan; and score Bulgaria's first goal. 
The veela had stopped dancing, and Bulgaria was again in possession of the Quaffle. 
Harry followed their descent through his Omnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was"They're going to crash!" screamed Hermione next to Harry. 
"Krum was feinting!" 
Lynch got to his feet at last, to loud cheers from the greenclad supporters, mounted his Firebolt, and kicked back off into the air. 
A mediwizard came tearing across the field, his fingers stuffed into his own ears, and kicked Mostafa hard in the shins. 
The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field. 
"He ended it when Ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead, the idiot!" 
Harry's eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light, as the Top Box was magically illuminated so that everyone in the stands could see the inside. 
But when Krum's name was announced, the whole stadium gave him a resounding, earsplitting roar. 
At last, when the Irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms (Aidan Lynch on the back of Confolly's, clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way), Bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered, "Quietus." 
Ah yes.... yes, I owe you... how much?" 
Mr. Weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these big plans were, but seemed to decide, upon reflection, that he didn't want to know. 
Harry saw himself in robes that had his name on the back, and imagined the sensation of hearing a hundredthousandstrong crowd roar, as Ludo Bagman's voice echoed throughout the stadium, "I give you... 
Harry never knew whether or not he had actually dropped off to sleephis fantasies of flying like Krum might well have slipped into actual dreamsall he knew was that, quite suddenly, Mr. Weasley was shouting. 
RonHarrycome on now, get up, this is urgent!" 
Dimly, he could tell that something was wrong. 
He slipped down from the bunk and reached for his clothes, but Mr. Weasley, who had pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas, said, "No time, Harryjust grab a jacket and get outsidequickly!" 
They didn't seem to have faces.... 
She illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path. 
Ron was lying sprawled on the ground. 
"Do you want to be showing off your knickers in midair? 
"Well... if they were, I wouldn't be likely to tell you, would I, Potter?" 
A huddle of teenagers in pajamas was arguing vociferously a little way along the path. 
Harry dug in the pockets of his jacket for his own wandbut it wasn't there. 
"Maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running?" Hermione suggested anxiously. 
She was moving in a most peculiar fashion, apparently with great difficulty; it was as though someone invisible were trying to hold her back. 
"People highhigh in the air! 
"What's up with her?" said Ron, looking curiously after Winky. 
They followed the dark path deeper into the wood, still keeping an eye out for Fred, George, and Ginny. 
"No, you're not!" yelled his friend. 
The words were hardly out of his mouth, when Ludo Bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them. 
"They'll find a way." 
It sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing. 
"Hello?" called Harry. 
And something vast, green, and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness Harry's eyes had been struggling to penetrate; it flew up over the treetops and into the sky. 
Without pausing to think, he yelled, "DUCK!" 
"Out of the way, Arthur," said a cold, curt voice. 
He and the other Ministry wizards were closing in on them. 
Harry got to his feet to face them. 
"Which of you did it?" he snapped, his sharp eyes darting between them. 
We got them! 
There's someone here! 
"Come off it, Amos," said Mr. Weasley quietly, "you don't seriously think it was the elf? 
Just then there was another pop, and Ludo Bagman Apparated right next to Mr. Weasley. 
She'd need a wand, for a start!" 
Her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of way. 
She caught sight of Mr. Diggory's feet, and slowly, tremulously, raised her eyes to stare up into his face; then, more slowly still, she looked up into the sky. 
"Do you know who I am? 
"And you were discovered moments later, right beneath it! 
"Excuse me?" said Mr. Diggory, incredulously. 
"I didn't drop it there, anyway," said Harry, jerking his thumb toward the trees beneath the skull. 
There was a deeply unpleasant silence. 
"Mr. Crouch, II never suggested you had anything to do with it!" Amos Diggory muttered again, now reddening behind his scrubby brown beard. 
"If you accuse my elf, you accuse me, Diggory!" shouted Mr. Crouch. 
"You may rest assured that she will be punished," Mr. Crouch added coldly. 
There was no pity in his gaze. 
But Hermione didn't seem to want to move; her eyes were still upon the sobbing elf. 
"What's going on in there?" 
"We can't prove it was them, Bill," said Mr. Weasley. 
"The point?" said Mr. Weasley with a hollow laugh. 
Half the Muggle killings back when YouKnowWho was in power were done for fun. 
"They'd have been pleased to see it, wouldn't they?" 
I don't reckon he'd be overpleased with them, do you?" 
"Oh thank goodness, thank goodness!" 
Dark wizards running unchecked... national disgrace... 
"I'll come with you, Father," said Percy importantly. 
"Hedwig, dear?" said Mrs. Weasley distractedly. 
I meanlast time your scar kept hurting, he was at Hogwarts, wasn't he?" 
"Yeah, but was it, though?" said Harry, turning to look out of the window at the brightening sky. 
"Don'tsayhisname!" Ron hissed through gritted teeth. 
"Oh Harry, you aren't going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says?" 
"Good thinking!" said Ron, his expression clearing. 
"They want compensation for their ruined property. 
"Home," "school," and "work" were there, but there was also "traveling," "lost," "hospital," "prison," and, in the position where the number twelve would be on a normal clock, "mortal peril." 
"They're working him far too hard. 
"What are you two up to?" said Mrs. Weasley sharply, her eyes on the twins. 
"Mr. Crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks," said Percy swiftly. 
"I think you'd all better go upstairs and check that you've packed properly!" said Mrs. Weasley, breaking up the argument. 
The rain sounded even louder at the top of the house, accompanied by loud whistlings and moans from the wind, not to mention sporadic howls from the ghoul who lived in the attic. 
"They're all like that! 
"I'll go starkers before I put that on," said Ron stubbornly. 
"Why couldn't I have some like that?" 
"Fine," snapped Mrs. Weasley. 
Goodness knows I could do with a laugh." 
Pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge Owl Treat. 
"Apparently one of them was still rocketing around when the pleasemen turned up" Mr. Weasley groaned. 
"He says someone tried to break into his house last night," said Mrs. Weasley. 
"Isn't he that nutter" "Your father thinks very highly of MadEye Moody," said Mrs. Weasley sternly. 
"Birds of a feather..." 
"He's an old friend of Dumbledore's, isn't he?" said Charlie. 
"Dumbledore's not what you'd call normal, though, is he?" said Fred. 
Doesn't trust anyone anymore. 
Pigwidgeon became noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist. 
"Yeah, I sort of wish I were back at Hogwarts this year," said Bill, hands in his pockets, looking almost wistfully at the train. 
"Yeah, thanks for everything, Mrs. Weasley," said Harry. 
"I'm sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you.... 
The pistons hissed loudly and the train began to move. 
But Mrs. Weasley only smiled and waved. 
"Erwhy not?" said Harry. 
"Just you, then," said Ron. 
"So Durmstrang'll just look like a ruin to an outsider too?" 
"But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north," said Hermione thoughtfully. 
Shame his mother likes him...." 
The sky was so dark and the windows so steamy that the lanterns were lit by midday. 
Several of their friends looked in on them as the afternoon progressed, including Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom, a roundfaced, extremely forgetful boy who had been brought up by his formidable witch of a grandmother. 
It sounded amazing though." 
'Are you going to enter?' Malfoy repeated. 
"I suppose you will, Potter? 
Ron got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment door so hard behind them that the glass shattered. 
Drenched and sputtering, Ron staggered sideways into Harry, just as a second water bomb droppednarrowly missing Hermione, it burst at Harry's feet, sending a wave of cold water over his sneakers into his socks. 
Little squirts! 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione slipped and slid across the entrance hall and through the double doors on the right, Ron muttering furiously under his breath as he pushed his sopping hair off his face. 
It was enchanted to look like the sky outside, and he had never seen it look this stormy. 
"Oh hurry up," Ron moaned, beside Harry, "I could eat a hippogriff." 
Tiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over Hagrid's moleskin, just as Hagrid himself sidled into the Hall through a door behind the teachers' table. 
"It was brilliant! 
And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat!" 
The Sorting continued; boys and girls with varying degrees of fright on their faces moving one by one to the threelegged stool, the line dwindling slowly as Professor McGonagall passed the L's. 
And finally, with "Whitby, Kevin!" ("HUFFLEPUFF!"), the Sorting ended. 
"The usual argument, you know. 
He wanted to attend the feastwell, it's quite out of the question, you know what he's like, utterly uncivilized, can't see a plate of food without throwing it. 
"Well, they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day, do they?" said Nearly Headless Nick. 
"They come out at night to do a bit of cleaning... see to the fires and so on.... I mean, you're not supposed to see them, are you? 
"Oh c'mon, 'Ermyknee," said Ron, accidentally spraying Harry with bits of Yorkshire pudding. 
"Slave labor," said Hermione, breathing hard through her nose. 
He looked around at Fred and George, his fellow members of the Quidditch team. 
He lowered his hood, shook out a long mane of grizzled, dark gray hair, then began to walk up toward the teachers' table. 
Another flash of lightning crossed the ceiling. 
Dumbledore nodded and gestured the man to the empty seat on his righthand side. 
"May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?" said Dumbledore brightly into the silence. 
"Moody?" Harry muttered to Ron. 
The one your dad went to help this morning?" 
"What happened to him?" Hermione whispered. 
Dumbledore cleared his throat. 
At every House table, Harry could see people either gazing raptly at Dumbledore, or else whispering fervently to their neighbors. 
Only students who are of agethat is to say, seventeen years or olderwill be allowed to put forward their names for consideration. 
His light blue eyes twinkled as they flickered over Fred's and George's mutinous faces. 
His old poster of the West Ham football team was pinned right next to it. 
It was extremely comfortable, lying there in bed and listening to the storm raging outside. 
"Today's not bad... outside all morning," said Ron, who was running his finger down the Monday column of his schedule. 
On the other side of the Hall Draco Malfoy's eagle owl had landed on his shoulder, carrying what looked like his usual supply of sweets and cakes from home. 
Trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach, Harry returned to his porridge. 
Hagrid pointed down into the crates. 
Now, yeh'll wan' ter try them on a few diff'rent thingsI've never had them before, not sure what they'll go ferI got ant eggs and frog livers and a bit of grass snakejust try them out with a bit of each." 
"Ouch!" yelled Dean Thomas after about ten minutes. 
Hagrid hurried over to him, looking anxious. 
"They are now," said Hermione in an exasperated voice, "but once Hagrid's found out what they eat, I expect they'll be six feet long." 
"You know perfectly well I only said that to shut Malfoy up," said Hermione. 
They sat down at the Gryffindor table and helped themselves to lamb chops and potatoes. 
The familiar sweet perfume spreading from the fire met their nostrils as they emerged at the top of the stepladder. 
Human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays, which intermingle..." 
"I was saying, my dear, that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of Saturn," said Professor Trelawney, a faint note of resentment in her voice at the fact that he had obviously not been hanging on her words. 
"Born underwhat, sorry?" said Harry. 
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing there, each looking thoroughly pleased about something. 
"Imagine them not even getting his name right, Weasley. 
Malfoy straightened the paper with a flourish and read on: Arnold Weasley, who was charged with possession of a flying car two years ago, was yesterday involved in a tussle with several Muggle lawkeepers ("policemen") over a number of highly aggressive dustbins. 
Mr. Weasley appears to have rushed to the aid of "MadEye" Moody, the aged exAuror who retired from the Ministry when no longer able to tell the difference between a handshake and attempted murder. 
"So tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the picture?" 
Professor McGonagall was coming down the marble staircase with her arms full of books. 
"No!" cried Professor McGonagall, running down the stairs and pulling out her wand; a moment later, with a loud snapping noise, Draco Malfoy had reappeared, lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair all over his now brilliantly pink face. 
He got to his feet, wincing. 
"He might've mentioned it, yeah," said Moody, scratching his chin unconcernedly, "but I thought a good sharp shock" "We give detentions, Moody! 
"I'll do that, then," said Moody, staring at Malfoy with great dislike. 
You tell him Moody's keeping a close eye on his son... you tell him that from me.... 
"Draco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing ferret." 
"Don't tell me you're going back to the library this evening?" said Harry, watching her. 
No sooner had she gone than her seat was taken by Fred Weasley. 
Fred, George, and Lee exchanged looks full of meaning. 
Ron dived into his bag for his schedule. 
They hurried into three chairs right in front of the teacher's desk, took out their copies of The Dark Forces: A Guide to SelfProtection, and waited, unusually quiet. 
Soon they heard Moody's distinctive clunking footsteps coming down the corridor, and he entered the room, looking as strange and frightening as ever. 
Moody took out a register, shook his long mane of grizzled gray hair out of his twisted and scarred face, and began to call out names, his normal eye moving steadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled around, fixing upon each student as he or she answered. 
Seems you've had a pretty thorough grounding in tackling Dark creaturesyou've covered boggarts, Red Caps, hinkypunks, grindylows, Kappas, and werewolves, is that right?" There was a general murmur of assent. 
I've got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark" "What, aren't you staying?" Ron blurted out. 
You need to be prepared. 
Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron's and Hermione's. 
"Ah, yes," said Moody appreciatively. 
Moody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his desk drawer, and took out a glass jar. 
Better avoid being hit with it if you can. 
The only class in which Neville usually volunteered information was Herbology which was easily his best subject. 
Moody was looking very intently at Neville, this time with both eyes. 
Harry looked around at her. 
Hermione's hand shook slightly as, for the third time, she raised it into the air. 
Several people looked uneasily around at her, including Ron. 
"Yes, the last and worst. 
And there's no countercurse. 
Had they been unblemished and unmarked too? 
Because you've got to know. 
"Now... those three cursesAvada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatusare known as the Unforgivable Curses. 
"Neville?" Hermione said gently. 
Neville looked around. 
I wonder what's for dinner, I'mI'm starving, aren't you?" 
All four of them fell silent, watching him apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard. 
Come on... we can have a cup of tea...." 
"You all right, are you, Potter?" 
No point pretending... well... come on, Longbottom, I've got some books that might interest you." 
"Some lesson, though, eh?" said Ron to Harry as they set off for the Great Hall. 
"Fred and George were right, weren't they? 
When he did Avada Kedavra, the way that spider just died, just snuffed it right" But Ron fell suddenly silent at the look on Harry's face and didn't speak again until they reached the Great Hall, when he said he supposed they had better make a start on Professor Trelawney's predictions tonight, since they would take hours. 
"Oh yes," said Neville, "I'm fine, thanks. 
"Yeah, you will be," said Ron darkly, "we're seeing the skrewts again on Monday. 
Okay, I'll lose a bet." 
Crookshanks wandered over to them, leapt lightly into an empty chair, and stared inscrutably at Harry, rather as Hermione might look if she knew they weren't doing their homework properly. 
Shortly after that, the twins rolled up their parchment, said good night, and went off to bed. 
Fred and George had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole opened and Hermione climbed into the common room carrying a sheaf of parchment in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked in the other. 
"Never heard of it," said Ron. 
"And you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying 'spew,' do you?" said Ron. 
Harry looked across the now empty common room and saw, illuminated by the moonlight, a snowy owl perched on the windowsill. 
The letter was very short, and looked as though it had been scrawled in a great hurry. 
"Dumbledore's reading what signs?" said Ron, looking perplexed. 
"It's made him think he's got to come back!" said Harry, now slamming his fist on the table so that Hedwig landed on the back of Ron's chair, hooting indignantly. 
Harry He then climbed out of the portrait hole, up through the silent castle (held up only briefly by Peeves, who tried to overturn a large vase on him halfway along the fourthfloor corridor), finally arriving at the Owlery, which was situated at the top of West Tower. 
"Just find him, all right?" Harry said, stroking her back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall. 
True, he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived, nor, late at night before he went to sleep, prevent himself from seeing horrible visions of Sirius, cornered by dementors down some dark London street, but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his godfather. 
Hermione went very pink and muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave. 
Professor McGonagall explained why, when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration homework she had assigned. 
"Maybe not, Thomas, but believe me, you need all the preparation you can get! 
"I will not," said Draco Malfoy flatly when Hagrid had proposed this with the air of Father Christmas pulling an extralarge toy out of his sack. 
LESSONS WILL END HALF AN HOUR EARLY"Brilliant!" said Harry. 
"I've heard he's a really good studentand he's a prefect." 
She spoke as though this settled the matter. "You only like him because he's handsome," said Ron scathingly. 
The suits of armor were suddenly gleaming and moving without squeaking, and Argus Filch, the caretaker, was behaving so ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes that he terrified a pair of firstyear girls into hysterics. 
He can't avoid us forrever. 
"What's a bummer?" Ron asked George. 
"She just told me to shut up and get on with transfiguring my raccoon." 
"You know, I bet we could do them, Harry. 
"Not in front of a panel of judges, you haven't," said Fred. 
"Follow me, please," said Professor McGonagall. 
They scanned the darkening grounds excitedly, but nothing was moving; everything was still, silent, and quite as usual. 
Harry had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in his life, and that was Hagrid; he doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights. 
Yet somehowmaybe simply because he was used to Hagridthis woman (now at the foot of the steps, and looking around at the waiting, wideeyed crowd) seemed even more unnaturally large. 
Dumbledore, though tall himself, had barely to bend to kiss it. 
"Well, if they're any bigger than this lot, even Hagrid won't be able to handle them," said Harry. 
For a few minutes, the silence was broken only by Madame Maxime's huge horses snorting and stamping. 
But then"Can you hear something?" said Ron suddenly. 
Slowly, magnificently, the ship rose out of the water, gleaming in the moonlight. 
"Dear old Hogwarts," he said, looking up at the castle and smiling; his teeth were rather yellow, and Harry noticed that his smile did not extend to his eyes, which remained cold and shrewd. 
Karkaroff beckoned forward one of his students. 
He didn't need the punch on the arm Ron gave him, or the hiss in his ear, to recognize that profile. 
don't believe it!" Ron said, in a stunned voice, as the Hogwarts students filed back up the steps behind the party from Durmstrang. 
"Hermionehe's one of the best Seekers in the world! 
"I bet Krum can see right through him, though... bet he gets people fawning over him all the time.... 
"Why's Filch putting out four chairs, who else is coming?" 
A few of the Hogwarts students laughed. 
He stared up at her, opened his mouth to reply, but nothing came out except a faint gurgling noise. 
"They make them okay at Hogwarts," said Harry without thinking. 
Harry felt a slight thrill of excitement, wondering what was coming. 
I would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket" "The what?" 
But this query was answered almost instantly; they were level with the Slytherin table now, and Karkaroff had just bustled up to his students. 
"Professor, Ivood like some vine," said one of the other Durmstrang boys hopefully. 
It had been placed in the center of the hall on the stool that normally bore the Sorting Hat. 
"All the Durmstrang lot," she replied. 
"The Aging Potion, dung brains," said Fred. 
"I'm sure Dumbledore will have thought of this." 
He surveyed Fred and George, his eyes twinkling. 
The decorations in the Great Hall had changed this morning. 
Harry led the way over to Dean and Seamus, who were discussing those Hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering. 
"It's your friend..." 
The students from Beauxbatons were coming through the front doors from the grounds, among them, the veelagirl. 
"What do you reckon'll happen to the ones who aren't chosen?" Ron muttered to Harry as the veelagirl dropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire. 
"Reckon they'll go back to school, or hang around to watch the tournament?" 
It was now slicked down into two bunchesperhaps he had tried a ponytail like Bill's, but found he had too much hair. 
On'y trouble is, they've started killin' each other." 
"Well, that's lucky," said Ron. 
Yeh'd be makin' them unhappy ter take away their work, and insutin' them if yeh tried ter pay them." 
Getting to their feet very cautiously, so that Hagrid wouldn't spot them, Harry, Ron, and Hermione peered through the window and saw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons students had just emerged from their carriage, clearly about to set off for the feast too. 
They couldn't hear what Hagrid was saying, but he was talking to Madame Maxime with a rapt, mistyeyed expression Harry had only ever seen him wear once beforewhen he had been looking at the baby dragon, Norbert. 
They let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them. 
"I estimate that it requires one more minute. 
Sparks began to fly from it. 
A second piece of parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames. 
"Go on," Hermione whispered, giving Harry a slight push. 
Hagrid was seated right at the end. 
He looked completely astonished and stared at Harry as he passed like everyone else. 
Cedric was standing with his hands behind his back, staring into the fire. 
"Extraordinary!" he muttered, squeezing Harry's arm. 
His surly face darkened as he surveyed Harry. 
"But, as you know, the age restriction was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure. 
And as his name's come out of the goblet... I mean, I don't think there can be any ducking out at this stage.... It's down in the rules, you're obliged... 
"No," said Harry vehemently. 
"I shall be lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic and the International Confederation of Wizards" "If anyone's got reason to complain, it's Potter," growled Moody, "but... funny thing... 
"Why should 'e complain?" burst out Fleur Delacour, stamping her foot. 
We have all been hoping to be chosen for weeks and weeks! 
"Maybe someone's hoping Potter is going to die for it," said Moody, with the merest trace of a growl. 
"There are those who'll turn innocent occasions to their advantage," Moody retorted in a menacing voice. 
"Well, shall we crack on, then?" he said, rubbing his hands together and smiling around the room. 
Barty, want to do the honors?" 
Yes ... the first task ..." 
"You'll come and have a drink before you go, at least?" said Dumbledore. 
I was telling the truth." 
Instead of going up the marble staircase, Cedric headed for a door to its right. 
Well, they were likely to get their wish.. 
"Well, well, well," said the Fat Lady, "Violet's just told me everything. 
Who's just been chosen as school champion, then?" 
He looked up when Harry slammed the door behind him. 
He was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin. 
What did you usethe Invisibility Cloak?" 
"I thought you might've told me if it was the cloak... because it would've covered both of us, wouldn't it? 
"If you don't want everyone else to know, fine, but I don't know why you're bothering to lie, you didn't get into trouble for it, did you? 
But the question is, who did put it in? 
"Jealous of what? 
She looked extremely anxious. 
Straight away, the moment we get back to the castle?" 
Thus amain, Seized with the spell, all creatures follow thee Whithersoever thou walkest forth to lead, And thence through seas and mountains and swift streams, Through leafy homes of birds and greening plains, Kindling the lure of love in every breast, Thou bringest the eternal generations forth, Kind after kind. 
Pour from those lips soft syllables to win Peace for the Romans, glorious Lady, peace! 
Hence too it comes that Nature all dissolves Into their primal bodies again, and naught Perishes ever to annihilation. For, were aught mortal in its every part, Before our eyes it might be snatched away Unto destruction; since no force were needed To sunder its members and undo its bands. 
The winds, Tis clear, are sightless bodies sweeping through The sea, the lands, the clouds along the sky, Vexing and whirling and seizing all amain; And forth they flow and pile destruction round, Even as the water's soft and supple bulk Becoming a river of abounding floods, Which a wide downpour from the lofty hills Swells with big showers, dashes headlong down Fragments of woodland and whole branching trees; Nor can the solid bridges bide the shock As on the waters whelm: the turbulent stream, Strong with a hundred rains, beats round the piers, Crashes with havoc, and rolls beneath its waves Downtoppled masonry and ponderous stone, Hurling away whatever would oppose. 
We see how wearingdown hath minished these, But just what motes depart at any time, The envious nature of vision bars our sight. Lastly whatever days and nature add Little by little, constraining things to grow In due proportion, no gaze however keen Of these our eyes hath watched and known. 
No more Can we observe what's lost at any time, When things wax old with eld and foul decay, Or when salt seas eat under beetling crags. Thus Nature ever by unseen bodies works. THE VOID But yet creation's neither crammed nor blocked About by body: there's in things a voidWhich to have known will serve thee many a turn, Nor will not leave thee wandering in doubt, Forever searching in the sum of all, And losing faith in these pronouncements mine. There's place intangible, a void and room. 
And then, if haply any think this comes, When bodies spring apart, because the air Somehow condenses, wander they from truth: For then a void is formed, where none before; And, too, a void is filled which was before. Nor can air be condensed in such a wise; Nor, granting it could, without a void, I hold, It still could not contract upon itself And draw its parts together into one. 
But since there's void in all begotten things, All solid matter must be round the same; Nor, by true reason canst thou prove aught hides And holds a void within its body, unless Thou grant what holds it be a solid. 
So in our programme of creation, mark How 'tis that, though the bodies of all stuff The ways whereby some things are fashioned softAir, water, earth, and fiery exhalationsAnd by what force they function and go on: The fact is founded in the void of things. 
But if the primal germs themselves be soft, Reason cannot be brought to bear to show The ways whereby may be created these Great crags of basalt and the during iron; For their whole nature will profoundly lack The first foundations of a solid frame. 
Moreover, were there not a minimum, The smallest bodies would have infinites, Since then a halfofhalf could still be halved, With limitless division less and less. Then what the difference 'twixt the sum and least? 
Thus whosoe'er have held the stuff of things To be but fire, and out of fire the sum, And whosoever have constituted air As first beginning of begotten things, And all whoever have held that of itself Water alone contrives things, or that earth Createth all and changes things anew To divers natures, mightily they seem A long way to have wandered from the truth. 
Wherefore, again, again: Needs must there come a many for supply; And also, that the blows themselves shall be Unfailing ever, must there ever be An infinite force of matter all sides round. And in these problems, shrink, my Memmius, far From yielding faith to that notorious talk: That all things inward to the centre press; And thus the nature of the world stands firm With never blows from outward, nor can be Nowhere dispartedsince all height and depth Have always inward to the centre pressed If thou art ready to believe that aught Itself can rest upon itself ); or that The ponderous bodies which be under earth Do all press upwards and do come to rest Upon the earth, in some ways upside down, Like to those images of things we see At present through the waters. 
But if we note how all this pomp at last Is but a drollery and a mocking sport, And of a truth man's dread, with cares at heels, Dreads not these sounds of arms, these savage swords But among kings and lords of all the world Mingles undaunted, nor is overawed By gleam of gold nor by the splendour bright Of purple robe, canst thou then doubt that this Is aught, but power of thinking?when, besides The whole of life but labours in the dark. 
But if thou believe That the primordial germs of things can stop, And in their stopping give new motions birth, Afar thou wanderest from the road of truth. 
And that more clearly thou perceive how all These mites of matter are darted round about, Recall to mind how nowhere in the sum Of All exists a bottom,nowhere is A realm of rest for primal bodies; since As amply shown and proved by reason sure) Space has no bound nor measure, and extends Unmetered forth in all directions round. 
For this reason too 'tis fit Thou turn thy mind the more unto these bodies Which here are witnessed tumbling in the light: Namely, because such tumblings are a sign That motions also of the primal stuff Secret and viewless lurk beneath, behind. 
Nor, when the fires will leap from under round The roofs of houses, and swift flame laps up Timber and beam, 'tis then to be supposed They act of own accord, no force beneath To urge them up. 'Tis thus that blood, discharged From out our bodies, spurts its jets aloft And spatters gore. 
Nay, too, the sun from peak of heaven Sheds round to every quarter its large heat, And sows the newploughed intervales with light: Thus also sun's heat downward tends to earth. 
Again, if ev'r all motions are colinked, And from the old ever arise the new In fixed order, and primordial seeds Produce not by their swerving some new start Of motion to sunder the covenants of fate, That cause succeed not cause from everlasting, Whence this free will for creatures o'er the lands, Whence is it wrested from the fates,this will Whereby we step right forward where desire Leads each man on, whereby the same we swerve In motions, not as at some fixed time, Nor at some fixed line of space, but where The mind itself has urged? 
Nor in no other wise could offspring know Mother, nor mother offspringwhich we see They yet can do, distinguished one from other, No less than human beings, by clear signs. 
For never a shape which charms our sense was made Without some elemental smoothness; whilst Whate'er is harsh and irksome has been framed Still with some roughness in its elements. 
But what are liquid, formed Of fluid body, they indeed must be Of elements more smooth and roundbecause Their globules severally will not cohere: To suck the poppyseeds from palm of hand Is quite as easy as drinking water down, And they, once struck, roll like unto the same. 
But that thou seest among the things that flow Some bitter, as the brine of ocean is, Is not the least a marvel... 
Since 'tis not so, but unto things are given Their fixed limitations which do bound Their sum on either side, 'tmust be confessed That matter, too, by finite tale of shapes Does differ. 
For though thou view'st some beasts to be more rare, And mark'st in them a less prolific stock, Yet in another region, in lands remote, That kind abounding may make up the count; Even as we mark among the fourfoot kind Snakehanded elephants, whose thousands wall With ivory ramparts India about, That her interiors cannot entered beSo big her count of brutes of which we see Such few examples. 
Nor can those motions that bring death prevail Forever, nor eternally entomb The welfare of the world; nor, further, can Those motions that give birth to things and growth Keep them forever when created there. Thus the long war, from everlasting waged, With equal strife among the elements Goes on and on. Now here, now there, prevail The vital forces of the worldor fall. 
Truly is earth insensate for all time; But, by obtaining germs of many things, In many a way she brings the many forth Into the light of sun. 
Which the primordials ought nowise to do. Since an immutable somewhat must remain, Lest all things utterly be brought to naught. 
Besides, since colours cannot be, sans light, And the primordials come not forth to light, Tis thine to know they are not clothed with colourTruly, what kind of colour could there be In the viewless dark? 
And those signs, So clear to all and witnessed out of hand, Do not refute this dictum nor oppose; But rather themselves do lead us by the hand, Compelling belief that living things are born Of elements insensate, as I say. Sooth, we may see from out the stinking dung Live worms spring up, when, after soaking rains, The drenched earth rots; and all things change the same: Lo, change the rivers, the fronds, the gladsome pastures Into the cattle, the cattle their nature change Into our bodies, and from our body, oft Grow strong the powers and bodies of wild beasts And mightywinged birds. 
Which well perceived if thou hold in mind, Then Nature, delivered from every haughty lord, And forthwith free, is seen to do all things Herself and through herself of own accord, Rid of all gods. 
For food it is must keep things whole, renewing; Tis food must prop and give support to all,But to no purpose, since nor veins suffice To hold enough, nor nature ministers As much as needful. And even now 'tis thus: Its age is broken and the earth, outworn With many parturitions, scarce creates The little livesshe who created erst All generations and gave forth at birth Enormous bodies of wild beasts of old. 
But nowhere to my vision rise no more The vaults of Acheron, though the broad earth Bars me no more from gazing down o'er all Which under our feet is going on below Along the void. 
But when the mind is moved by shock more fierce, We mark the whole soul suffering all at once Along man's members: sweats and pallors spread Over the body, and the tongue is broken, And fails the voice away, and ring the ears, Mists blind the eyeballs, and the joints collapse,Aye, men drop dead from terror of the mind. 
First, I aver, 'tis superfine, composed Of tiniest particlesthat such the fact Thou canst perceive, if thou attend, from this: Nothing is seen to happen with such speed As what the mind proposes and begins; Therefore the same bestirs itself more swiftly Than aught whose nature's palpable to eyes. 
But what's so agile must of seeds consist Most round, most tiny, that they may be moved, When hit by impulse slight. 
Death grants you everything, But vital sense and exhalation hot. 
And so, Again, again, nature of mind and soul Tis thine to know created is of seeds The tiniest ever, since at flyingforth It beareth nothing of the weight away. 
Thus nature of mind is triple; yet those all Suffice not for creating sensesince mind Accepteth not that aught of these can cause Sensebearing motions, and much less the thoughts A man revolves in mind. 
There is indeed in mind that heat it gets When seething in rage, and flashes from the eyes More swiftly fire; there is, again, that wind, Much, and so cold, companion of all dread, Which rouses the shudder in the shaken frame; There is no less that state of air composed, Making the tranquil breast, the serene face. 
Thus the race of men: Though training make them equally refined, It leaves those pristine vestiges behind Of each mind's nature. 
True!loses what Was even in its lifetime not its own; And much beside it loses, when soul's driven Forth from that lifetime. 
But if that centre, That tiny part of eye, be eaten through, Forthwith the vision fails and darkness comes, Though in all else the unblemished ball be clear. 
Now, then, since thou seest, Their liquids depart, their waters flow away, When jars are shivered, and since fog and smoke Depart into the winds away, believe The soul no less is shed abroad and dies More quickly far, more quickly is dissolved Back to its primal bodies, when withdrawn From out man's members it has gone away. 
For, sure, if body (container of the same Like as a jar), when shivered from some cause, And rarefied by loss of blood from veins, Cannot for longer hold the soul, how then Thinkst thou it can be held by any airA stuff much rarer than our bodies be? 
For air will be a body, be alive, If in that air the soul can keep itself, And in that air enclose those motions all Which in the thews and in the body itself A while ago it was making. 
Once more, since body's unable to sustain Division from the soul, without decay And obscene stench, how canst thou doubt but that The soul, uprisen from the body's deeps, Has filtered away, widedrifted like a smoke, Or that the changed body crumbling fell With ruin so entire, because, indeed, Its deep foundations have been moved from place, The soul outfiltering even through the frame, And through the body's every winding way And orifice? 
To that degree effect succeeds to cause, Nor is the flame once wont to be create In flowing streams, nor cold begot in fire. Besides, if nature of soul immortal be, And able to feel, when from our frame disjoined, The same, I fancy, must be thought to be Endowed with senses five,nor is there way But this whereby to image to ourselves How undersouls may roam in Acheron. 
Again, how often We view our fellow going by degrees, And losing limb by limb the vital sense; First nails and fingers of the feet turn blue, Next die the feet and legs, then o'er the rest Slow crawl the certain footsteps of cold death. 
But why themselves they thus should do and toil Tis hard to say, since, being free of body, They flit around, harassed by no disease, Nor cold nor famine; for the body labours By more of kinship to these flaws of life, And mind by contact with that body suffers So many ills. 
But if 'twere possible, Much rather might this very power of mind Be in the head, the shoulders or the heels, And, born in any part soever, yet In the same man, in the same vessel abide. But since within this body even of ours Stands fixed and appears arranged sure Where soul and mind can each exist and grow, Deny we must the more that they can have Duration and birth, wholly outside the frame. 
For if woe and ail Perchance are toward, then the man to whom The bane can happen must himself be there At that same time. 
But death precludeth this, Forbidding life to him on whom might crowd Such irk and care; and granted 'tis to know: Nothing for us there is to dread in death, No wretchedness for him who is no more, The same estate as if ne'er born before, When death immortal hath ta'en the mortal life. Hence, where thou seest a man to grieve because When dead he rots with body laid away, Or perishes in flames or jaws of beasts, Know well: he rings not true, and that beneath Still works an unseen sting upon his heart, However he deny that he believes. 
O even as here thou art, aslumber in death, So shalt thou slumber down the rest of time, Released from every harrying pang. But we, We have bewept thee with insatiate woe, Standing beside whilst on the awful pyre Thou wert made ashes; and no day shall take For us the eternal sorrow from the breast." 
Yet should one complain, Riper in years and elder, and lament, Poor devil, his death more sorely than is fit, Then would she not, with greater right, on him Cry out, inveighing with a voice more shrill: Off with thy tears, and choke thy whines, buffoon! 
Look back: Nothing to us was all forepassed eld Of time the eternal, ere we had a birth. And Nature holds this like a mirror up Of timetobe when we are dead and gone. And what is there so horrible appears? Now what is there so sad about it all? 
However hugely he extend his bulkWho hath for outspread limbs not acres nine, But the whole earthhe shall not able be To bear eternal pain nor furnish food From his own frame forever. 
Besides we're busied with the same devices, Ever and ever, and we are at them ever, And there's no new delight that may be forged By living on. But whilst the thing we long for Is lacking, that seems good above all else; Thereafter, when we've touched it, something else We long for; ever one equal thirst of life Grips us agape. 
But lest Haply thou holdest that those images Which come from objects are the sole that flit, Others indeed there be of own accord Begot, selfformed in earth's aery skies, Which, moulded to innumerable shapes, Are borne aloft, and, fluid as they are, Cease not to change appearance and to turn Into new outlines of all sorts of forms; As we behold the clouds grow thick on high And smirch the serene vision of the world, Stroking the air with motions. 
Thus likewise must the images have power Through unimaginable space to speed Within a point of time,first, since a cause Exceeding small there is, which at their back Far forward drives them and propels, where, too, They're carried with such winged lightness on; And, secondly, since furnished, when sent off, With texture of such rareness that they can Through objects whatsoever penetrate And ooze, as 'twere, through intervening air. 
Now these same films I name are borne about And tossed and scattered into regions all. But since we do perceive alone through eyes, It follows hence that whitherso we turn Our sight, all things do strike against it there With form and hue. And just how far from us Each thing may be away, the image yields To us the power to see and chance to tell: For when 'tis sent, at once it shoves ahead And drives along the air that's in the space Betwixt it and our eyes. And thus this air All glides athrough our eyeballs, and, as 'twere, Brushes athrough our pupils and thuswise Passes across. 
Again, whene'er we thump With fingertip upon a stone, we touch But the rock's surface and the outer hue, Nor feel that hue by contactrather feel The very hardness deep within the rock. 
Again, whatever jaundiced people view Becomes wanyellow, since from out their bodies Flow many seeds wanyellow forth to meet The films of things, and many too are mixed Within their eye, which by contagion paint All things with sallowness. 
Likewise the tasting tongue Has its own power apart, and smells apart And sounds apart are known. And thus it is That no one sense can e'er convict another. 
I have seen Spots that gave back even voices six or seven For one thrown forthfor so the very hills, Dashing them back against the hills, kept on With their reverberations. 
And these spots The neighbouring countryside doth feign to be Haunts of the goatfoot satyrs and the nymphs; And tells you there be fauns, by whose night noise And antic revels yonder they declare The voiceless silences are broken oft, And tones of strings are made and wailings sweet Which the pipe, beat by players' fingertips, Pours out; and far and wide the farmerrace Begins to hear, when, shaking the garmentings Of pine upon his halfbeast head, godPan With puckered lip oft runneth o'er and o'er The open reeds,lest flute should cease to pour The woodland music! 
Again, As all the breathing creatures which take food Are outwardly unlike, and outer cut And contour of their members bounds them round, Each differing kind by kind, they thus consist Of seeds of varying shape. 
Thus, Centaurs and the limbs of Scyllas, thus The Cerberusvisages of dogs we see, And images of people gone beforeDead men whose bones earth bosomed long ago; Because the images of every kind Are everywhere about us bornein part Those which are gendered in the very air Of own accord, in part those others which From divers things do part away, and those Which are compounded, made from out their shapes. 
And when the sleep has overset our frame, The mind's intelligence is now awake, Still for no other reason, save that theseThe selfsame films as when we are awakeAssail our minds, to such degree indeed That we do seem to see for sure the man Whom, void of life, now death and earth have gained Dominion over. 
Assemblies of the citizens, parades, Banquets, and battles, these and all doth she, Nature, create and furnish at our word? Maugre the fact that in same place and spot Another's mind is meditating things All far unlike. 
And, verily, Yielding the weary body to repose, Far ancienter than cushions of soft beds, And quenching thirst is earlier than cups. 
Nor yet in these affairs is aught for wonder That particles so fine can whirl around So great a body and turn this weight of ours; For wind, so tenuous with its subtle body, Yet pushes, driving on the mighty ship Of mighty bulk; one hand directs the same, Whatever its momentum, and one helm Whirls it around, whither you please; and loads, Many and huge, are moved and hoisted high By enginery of pulleyblocks and wheels, With but light strain. Now, by what modes this sleep Pours through our members waters of repose And frees the breast from cares of mind, I'll tell In verses sweeter than they many are; Even as the swan's slight note is better far Than that dispersed clamour of the cranes Among the south wind's aery clouds. 
In sooth, where no one part of soul remained Lurking among the members, even as fire Lurks buried under many ashes, whence Could sense amain rekindled be in members, As flame can rise anew from unseen fire? 
And therefore almost all Are covered either with hides, or else with shells, Or with the horny callus, or with bark. 
Nature now So hedges off approaches and the paths; And thus the sense, its motions all deranged, Retires down deep within; and since there's naught, As 'twere, to prop the frame, the body weakens, And all the members languish, and the arms And eyelids fall, and, as you lie abed, Even there the houghs will sag and loose their powers. 
And in same wise, This threefold change: a forcing of the soul Down deeper, more a castingforth of it, A moving more divided in its parts And scattered more. And to whate'er pursuit A man most clings absorbed, or what the affairs On which we theretofore have tarried much, And mind hath strained upon the more, we seem In sleep not rarely to go at the same. 
And hounds of huntsmen oft in soft repose Yet toss asudden all their legs about, And growl and bark, and with their nostrils sniff The winds again, again, though indeed They'd caught the scented footprints of wild beasts, And, even when wakened, often they pursue The phantom images of stags, as though They did perceive them fleeing on before, Until the illusion's shaken off and dogs Come to themselves again. And fawning breed Of housebred whelps do feel the sudden urge To shake their bodies and start from off the ground, As if beholding strangervisages. 
As when the thirsty man in slumber seeks To drink, and water ne'er is granted him Wherewith to quench the heat within his members, But after idols of the liquids strives And toils in vain, and thirsts even whilst he gulps In middle of the torrent, thus in love Venus deludes with idolimages The lovers. 
But when at last Lust, gathered in the thews, hath spent itself, There come a brief pause in the raging heatBut then a madness just the same returns And that old fury visits them again, When once again they seek and crave to reach They know not what, all powerless to find The artifice to subjugate the bane. In such uncertain state they waste away With unseen wound. 
These ills are found in prospering love and true; But in crossed love and helpless there be such As through shut eyelids thou canst still take inUncounted ills; so that 'tis better far To watch beforehand, in the way I've shown, And guard against enticements. 
Yet even when there enmeshed with tangled feet, Still canst thou scape the dangerlest indeed Thou standest in the way of thine own good, And overlookest first all blemishes Of mind and body of thy much preferred, Desirable dame. 
But let her face possess what charm you will, Let Venus' glory rise from all her limbs,Forsooth there still are others; and forsooth We lived before without her; and forsooth She does the same thingsand we know she doesAll, as the ugly creature and she scents, Yes she, her wretched self with vile perfumes; Whom even her handmaids flee and giggle at Behind her back. 
And in this business 'tis of some import Upon what diet life is nourished: For some foods thicken seeds within our members, And others thin them out and waste away. 
Therefore that man who subjugated these, And from the mind expelled, by words indeed, Not arms, O shall it not be seemly him To dignify by ranking with the gods?And all the more since he was wont to give, Concerning the immortal gods themselves, Many pronouncements with a tongue divine, And to unfold by his pronouncements all The nature of the world. 
Also I shall untangle by what power The steersman Nature guides the sun's courses, And the meanderings of the moon, lest we, Percase, should fancy that of own free will They circle their perennial courses round, Timing their motions for increase of crops And living creatures, or lest we should think They roll along by any plan of gods. 
Likewise, thou canst ne'er Believe the sacred seats of gods are here In any regions of this mundane world; Indeed, the nature of the gods, so subtle, So far removed from these our senses, scarce Is seen even by intelligence of mind. And since they've ever eluded touch and thrust Of human hands, they cannot reach to grasp Aught tangible to us. 
Wherefore, besides, also their seats must be Unlike these seats of ours,even subtle too, As meet for subtle essenceas I'll prove Hereafter unto thee with large discourse. 
Further, to say that for the sake of men They willed to prepare this world's magnificence, And that 'tis therefore duty and behoof To praise the work of gods as worthy praise, And that 'tis sacrilege for men to shake Ever by any force from out their seats What hath been stablished by the Forethought old To everlasting for races of mankind, And that 'tis sacrilege to assault by words And overtopple all from base to beam,Memmius, such notions to concoct and pile, Is verilyto dote. 
Verily, I guess, because The Sum is new, and of a recent date The nature of our universe, and had Not long ago its own exordium. 
Yet if, percase, thou deemest that ere this Existed all things even the same, but that Perished the cycles of the human race In fiery exhalations, or cities fell By some tremendous quaking of the world, Or rivers in fury, after constant rains, Had plunged forth across the lands of earth And whelmed the townsthen, all the more must thou Confess, defeated by the argument, That there shall be annihilation too Of lands and sky. 
FORMATION OF THE WORLD AND ASTRONOMICAL QUESTIONS But in what modes that conflux of firststuff Did found the multitudinous universe Of earth, and sky, and the unfathomed deeps Of ocean, and courses of the sun and moon, I'll now in order tell. 
When, then, these substances had been withdrawn, Amain the earth, where now extend the vast Cerulean zones of all the level seas, Caved in, and down along the hollows poured The whirlpools of her brine; and day by day The more the tides of ether and rays of sun On every side constrained into one mass The earth by lashing it again, again, Upon its outer edges (so that then, Being thus beat upon, it was all condensed About its proper centre), ever the more The salty sweat, from out its body squeezed, Augmented ocean and the fields of foam By seeping through its frame, and all the more Those many particles of heat and air Escaping, began to fly aloft, and form, By condensation there afar from earth, The high refulgent circuits of the heavens. 
Then ocean, then the air, Then ether herself, the fraughtwithfire, were all Left with their liquid bodies pure and free, And each more lighter than the next below; And ether, most light and liquid of the three, Floats on above the long aerial winds, Nor with the brawling of the winds of air Mingles its liquid body. It doth leave All therethose underrealms below her heightsThere to be overset in whirlwinds wild,Doth leave all there to brawl in wayward gusts, Whilst, gliding with a fixed impulse still, Itself it bears its fires along. 
For all The far removed objects of our gaze Seem through much air confused in their look Ere minished in their bigness. Wherefore, moon, Since she presents bright look and clearcut form, May there on high by us on earth be seen Just as she is with extreme bounds defined, And just of the size. 
Or else because, as said, In alternating seasons of the year Fires, now more quick, and now more slow, are wont To stream togetherthe fires which make the sun To rise in some one spottherefore it is That those men seem to speak the truth who hold A new sun is with each new daybreak born. 
For near her is, percase, another body, Invisible, because devoid of light, Borne on and gliding all along with her, Which in three modes may block and blot her disk. 
As yet they knew not to enkindle fire Against the cold, nor hairy pelts to use And clothe their bodies with the spoils of beasts; But huddled in groves, and mountaincaves, and woods, And 'mongst the thickets hid their squalid backs, When driven to flee the lashings of the winds And the big rains. 
And men would think them in their happiness Excelling far, because the fear of death Vexed no one of them at all, and since At same time in men's sleeps men saw them do So many wonders, and yet feel therefrom Themselves no weariness. Besides, men marked How in a fixed order rolled around The systems of the sky, and changed times On annual seasons, nor were able then To know thereof the causes. Therefore it was Men would take refuge in consigning all Unto divinities, and in feigning all Was guided by their nod. 
Do not the peoples and the nations shake, And haughty kings do they not hug their limbs, Strook through with fear of the divinities, Lest for aught foully done or madly said The heavy time be now at hand to pay? 
Then would it enter their heads how these same lumps, If melted by heat, could into any form Or figure of things be run, and how, again, If hammered out, they could be nicely drawn To sharpest points or finest edge, and thus Yield to the forgers tools and give them power To chop the forest down, to hew the logs, To shave the beams and planks, besides to bore And punch and drill. 
Now, Memmius, How nature of iron discovered was, thou mayst Of thine own self divine. 
With copper men to work the soil began, With copper to rouse the hurly waves of war, To straw the monstrous wounds, and seize away Another's flocks and fields. 
And next The Punic folk did train the elephantsThose curst Lucanian oxen, hideous, The serpenthanded, with turrets on their bulksTo dure the wounds of war and panicstrike The mighty troops of Mars. Thus Discord sad Begat the one Thing after other, to be The terror of the nations under arms, And day by day to horrors of old war She added an increase. 
But sun and moon, those watchmen of the world, With their own lanterns traversing around The mighty, the revolving vault, have taught Unto mankind that seasons of the years Return again, and that the Thing takes place After a fixed plan and order fixed. 
For when saw he that wellnigh everything Which needs of man most urgently require Was ready to hand for mortals, and that life, As far as might be, was established safe, That men were lords in riches, honour, praise, And eminent in goodly fame of sons, And that they yet, O yet, within the home, Still had the anxious heart which vexed life Unpausingly with torments of the mind, And raved perforce with angry plaints, then he, Then he, the master, did perceive that it was The vessel itself which worked the bane, and all, However wholesome, which from here or there Was gathered into it, was by that bane Spoilt from withinin part, because he saw The vessel so cracked and leaky that nowise Tcould ever be filled to brim; in part because He marked how it polluted with foul taste Whate'er it got within itself. 
For just as children tremble and fear all In the viewless dark, so even we at times Dread in the light so many things that be No whit more fearsome than what children feign, Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark. 
And they give forth O'er skiey levels of the spreading world A sound on high, as linenawning, stretched O'er mighty theatres, gives forth at times A cracking roar, when much 'tis beaten about Betwixt the poles and crossbeams. Sometimes, too, Asunder rent by wanton gusts, it raves And imitates the tearing sound of sheets Of papereven this kind of noise thou mayst In thunder hearor sound as when winds whirl With lashings and do buffet about in air A hanging cloth and flying papersheets. 
For sometimes, too, it chances that the clouds Cannot together crash headon, but rather Move sidewise and with motions contrary Graze each the other's body without speed, From whence that dry sound grateth on our ears, So long drawnout, until the clouds have passed From out their close positions. 
Therefore, when this same wind afire Hath split black cloud, it scatters the fireseeds, Which, so to say, have been pressed out by force Of sudden from the cloudand these do make The pulsing flashes of flame; thence followeth The detonation which attacks our ears More tardily than aught which comes along Unto the sight of eyeballs. 
Lo, then, Here be all things fulfilled with winds and firesHence the long lightnings and the thunders loud. 
And, further, easily Brass it unbinds and quickly fuseth gold, Because its force is so minutely made Of tiny parts and elements so smooth That easily they wind their way within, And, when once in, quickly unbind all knots And loosen all the bonds of union there. 
Why rouseth he beforehand darkling air And the far din and rumblings? 
It happens too That very vortex of the wind involves Itself in clouds, scraping from out the air The seeds of cloud, and counterfeits, as 'twere, The "bellows" pushed from heaven. 
For very fact and feeling, As we upclimb high mountains, proveth clear That windy are those upward regions free. 
Then all the builded houses Above groundand the more, the higher upreared Unto the skylean ominously, careening Into the same direction; and the beams, Wrenched forward, overhang, ready to go. 
But if, indeed, They burst not forth, yet is the very rush Of the wild air and furyforce of wind Then dissipated, like an aguefit, Through the innumerable pores of earth, To set her all ashakeeven as a chill, When it hath gone into our marrowbones, Sets us convulsively, despite ourselves, Ashivering and ashaking. 
In midseason heats Often and oft he waters Aegypt o'er, Either because in summer against his mouths Come those north winds which at that time of year Men name the Etesian blasts, and, blowing thus Upstream, retard, and, forcing back his waves, Fill him o'erfull and force his flow to stop. 
And seest thou not how in the very earth Sulphur is gendered and bitumen thickens With noisome stench. What direful stenches, too, Scaptensula outbreathes from down below, When men pursue the veins of silver and gold, With pickaxe probing round the hidden realms Deep in the earth?Or what of deadly bane The mines of gold exhale? O what a look, And what a ghastly hue they give to men! 
This stone men marvel at; and sure it oft Maketh a chain of rings, depending, lo, From off itself! 
For ever doth the circumambient air Drub things unmoved, but here it pushes forth The iron, because upon one side the space Lies void and thus receives the iron in. 
This air, whereof I am reminding thee, Winding athrough the iron's abundant pores So subtly into the tiny parts thereof, Shoves it and pushes, as wind the ship and sails. 
Thou seest, first, How lime alone cementeth stones: how wood Only by glueofbull with wood is joinedSo firmly too that oftener the boards Crack open along the weakness of the grain Ere ever those taurine bonds will lax their hold. 
The vineborn juices with the watersprings Are bold to mix, though not the heavy pitch With the light oilofolive. 
When these have, haply, chanced to collect And to derange the atmosphere of earth, The air becometh baneful. 
THE PLAGUE ATHENS Twas such a manner of disease, it was such Mortal miasma in Cecropian lands Whilom reduced the plains to dead men's bones, Unpeopled the highways, drained of citizens The Athenian town. For coming from afar, Rising in lands of Aegypt, traversing Reaches of air and floating fields of foam, At last on all Pandion's folk it swooped; Whereat by troops unto disease and death Were they o'ergiven. At first, they'd bear about A skull on fire with heat, and eyeballs twain Red with suffusion of blank glare. 
Nor in the city then Remained those rites of sepulture, with which That pious folk had evermore been wont To buried be. For it was wildered all In wild alarms, and each and every one With sullen sorrow would bury his own dead, As present shift allowed. 
STRANGER:  Shall we relieve him, and take his companion, the Young Socrates, instead of him?  What do you advise? 
STRANGER:  Well, and are not arithmetic and certain other kindred arts, merely abstract knowledge, wholly separated from action? 
STRANGER:  Think whether you can find any joint or parting in knowledge. 
STRANGER:  Are not all such sciences, no less than arithmetic and the like, subjects of pure knowledge; and is not the difference between the two classes, that the one sort has the power of judging only, and the other of ruling as well? 
STRANGER:  Then shall we mingle the kingly art in the same class with the art of the herald, the interpreter, the boatswain, the prophet, and the numerous kindred arts which exercise command; or, as in the preceding comparison we spoke of manufacturers, or sellers for themselves, and of retailers,seeing, too, that the class of supreme rulers, or rulers for themselves, is almost nameless—shall we make a word following the same analogy, and refer kings to a supreme or rulingforself science, leaving the rest to receive a name from some one else?  For we are seeking the ruler; and our enquiry is not concerned with him who is not a ruler. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  How would you divide them? 
STRANGER:  One part may be set over the production of lifeless, the other of living objects; and in this way the whole will be divided. 
STRANGER:  Of course that which exercises command about animals.  For, surely, the royal science is not like that of a masterworkman, a science presiding over lifeless objects;the king has a nobler function, which is the management and control of living beings. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  No matter;whichever suggests itself to us in the course of conversation. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  I will try;there appears to me to be one management of men and another of beasts. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  What is the error? 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  What was the error of which, as you say, we were guilty in our recent division? 
STRANGER:  You remember how that part of the art of knowledge which was concerned with command, had to do with the rearing of living creatures,I mean, with animals in herds? 
STRANGER:  In that case, there was already implied a division of all animals into tame and wild; those whose nature can be tamed are called tame, and those which cannot be tamed are called wild. 
STRANGER:  And where shall we look for the political animal?  Might not an idiot, so to speak, know that he is a pedestrian? 
STRANGER:  The tame walking herding animals are distributed by nature into two classes. 
STRANGER:  But the remainder of the hornless herd of tame animals will not mix the breed. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  What is that? 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  What? 
STRANGER:  And now, I will not wait for you to ask the, but will of my own accord take you by the shorter road to the definition of a king. 
STRANGER:  There were many arts of shepherding, and one of them was the political, which had the charge of one particular herd? 
STRANGER:  I think that we may have a little amusement; there is a famous tale, of which a good portion may with advantage be interwoven, and then we may resume our series of divisions, and proceed in the old path until we arrive at the desired summit.  Shall we do as I say? 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  Such changes would naturally occur. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  Certainly. 
STRANGER:  All other herdsmen ‘rear’ their herds, but this is not a suitable term to apply to the Statesman; we should use a name which is common to them all. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  How can they be made? 
STRANGER:  And the art of management which is assigned to man would again have to be subdivided. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  I think, Stranger, that we have now completed the account of the Statesman. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  What do you mean? 
STRANGER:  Why, because my ‘example’ requires the assistance of another example. 
STRANGER:  Will not the best and easiest way of bringing them to a knowledge of what they do not as yet know be— 
STRANGER:  To refer them first of all to cases in which they judge correctly about the letters in question, and then to compare these with the cases in which they do not as yet know, and to show them that the letters are the same, and have the same character in both combinations, until all cases in which they are right have been placed side by side with all cases in which they are wrong.  In this way they have examples, and are made to learn that each letter in every combination is always the same and not another, and is always called by the same name. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  Hardly. 
STRANGER:  Then you and I will not be far wrong in trying to see the nature of example in general in a small and particular instance; afterwards from lesser things we intend to pass to the royal class, which is the highest form of the same nature, and endeavour to discover by rules of art what the management of cities is; and then the dream will become a reality to us. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  Very true. 
STRANGER:  Then, once more, let us resume the previous argument, and as there were innumerable rivals of the royal race who claim to have the care of states, let us part them all off, and leave him alone; and, as I was saying, a model or example of this process has first to be framed. 
STRANGER:  But the first process is a separation of the clotted and matted fibres? 
STRANGER:  The arts which do not manufacture the actual thing, but which furnish the necessary tools for the manufacture, without which the several arts could not fulfil their appointed work, are cooperative; but those which make the things themselves are causal. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  A very reasonable distinction. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  To be sure. 
STRANGER:  Then suppose that you define the warp and the woof, for I think that the definition will be of use to you. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  What? 
STRANGER:  The next step clearly is to divide the art of measurement into two parts, as we have said already, and to place in the one part all the arts which measure number, length, depth, breadth, swiftness with their opposites; and to have another part in which they are measured with the mean, and the fit, and the opportune, and the due, and with all those words, in short, which denote a mean or standard removed from the extremes. 
STRANGER:  And now that this discussion is completed, let us go on to consider another question, which concerns not this argument only but the conduct of such arguments in general. 
STRANGER:  We must carve them like a victim into members or limbs, since we cannot bisect them.  (Compare Phaedr.)  For we certainly should divide everything into as few parts as possible. 
STRANGER:  To the class of vessels, as they are comprehensively termed, which are constructed for the preservation of things moist and dry, of things prepared in the fire or out of the fire; this is a very large class, and has, if I am not mistaken, literally nothing to do with the royal art of which we are in search. 
STRANGER:  The provision of food and of all other things which mingle their particles with the particles of the human body, and minister to the body, will form a seventh class, which may be called by the general term of nourishment, unless you have any better name to offer.  This, however, appertains rather to the husbandman, huntsman, trainer, doctor, cook, and is not to be assigned to the Statesman’s art. 
STRANGER:  These seven classes include nearly every description of property, with the exception of tame animals.  Consider;there was the original material, which ought to have been placed first; next come instruments, vessels, vehicles, defences, playthings, nourishment; small things, which may be included under one of these—as for example, coins, seals and stamps, are omitted, for they have not in them the character of any larger kind which includes them; but some of them may, with a little forcing, be placed among ornaments, and others may be made to harmonize with the class of implements.  The art of herding, which has been already divided into parts, will include all property in tame animals, except slaves. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  No; unless, indeed, to the politics of commerce. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  Precisely. STRANGER:  But who are these other kings and priests elected by lot who now come into view followed by their retainers and a vast throng, as the former class disappears and the scene changes? 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  What? 
STRANGER:  Democracy alone, whether rigidly observing the laws or not, and whether the multitude rule over the men of property with their consent or against their consent, always in ordinary language has the same name. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  I agree, Stranger, in the greater part of what you say; but as to their ruling without laws—the expression has a harsh sound. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  Quite true. STRANGER:  And when the citizen, contrary to law and custom, is compelled to do what is juster and better and nobler than he did before, the last and most absurd thing which he could say about such violence is that he has incurred disgrace or evil or injustice at the hands of those who compelled him. 
STRANGER:  And yet the mere suggestion which I hastily threw out is highly important, even if we leave the question where it is, and do not seek by the discussion of it to expose the error which prevails in this matter. 
STRANGER:  Therefore, as there is a danger of this, the next best thing in legislating is not to allow either the individual or the multitude to break the law in any respect whatever. 
STRANGER:  The laws would be copies of the true particulars of action as far as they admit of being written down from the lips of those who have knowledge? 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  Certainly they would. 
STRANGER:  And, as we were saying, he who has knowledge and is a true Statesman, will do many things within his own sphere of action by his art without regard to the laws, when he is of opinion that something other than that which he has written down and enjoined to be observed during his absence would be better. 
STRANGER:  And any individual or any number of men, having fixed laws, in acting contrary to them with a view to something better, would only be acting, as far as they are able, like the true Statesman? 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  That is true. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  Very true. 
STRANGER:  You mean to say that the science which judges whether we ought to learn or not, must be superior to the science which is learned or which teaches? 
STRANGER:  And we must also suppose that this rules the other, if we are not to give up our former notion? 
STRANGER:  And, considering how great and terrible the whole art of war is, can we imagine any which is superior to it but the truly royal? 
STRANGER:  The review of all these sciences shows that none of them is political or royal.  For the truly royal ought not itself to act, but to rule over those who are able to act; the king ought to know what is and what is not a fitting opportunity for taking the initiative in matters of the greatest importance, whilst others should execute his orders. 
STRANGER:  Then I must describe the nature of the royal web, and show how the various threads are woven into one piece. 
STRANGER:  Let me put the matter in another way:  I suppose that you would consider courage to be a part of virtue? 
STRANGER:  That they are two principles which thoroughly hate one another and are antagonistic throughout a great part of nature. 
STRANGER:  Acuteness and quickness, whether in body or soul or in the movement of sound, and the imitations of them which painting and music supply, you must have praised yourself before now, or been present when others praised them. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  To be sure. 
STRANGER:  Let us consider a further point. 
YOUNG SOCRATES:  Very right. 
STRANGER:  The quiet orderly class seek for natures like their own, and as far as they can they marry and give in marriage exclusively in this class, and the courageous do the same; they seek natures like their own, whereas they should both do precisely the opposite. 
based upon The Book of Ulgo and other fragments 
Many creatures were unseemly and strange. 
But UL stretched forth his hand and prevented them, saying: "What you have wrought you may not unmake. 
Therefore, stay here and rest upon this plain. 
Thy making and thy casting out were none of my doing." 
"O my God," he cried, "hide not thy face from thy people who are sorely afflicted because they are outcast and have no God to protect them." 
Cease thy complaining. 
Another year passed while nameless, unseen things brought him food and drink. 
Gorim seated himself on the earth and said: "Yet will I abide, O my God." Abide if it please thee," UL said and departed. 
Gorim abode, the creatures sustained him, and UL was troubled. 
UL raised his hand, and the people were made colorless like Gorim. 
Now I return to Prolgu, the holy place. 
He turned and went toward the mountains. 
For a thousand years, the peace of UL was with them, and they believed it would last forever. 
They rose against the fellowship of UL and cast down the cities and slew the people, until few remained. 
The people went down into the sacred caves of UL and dwelt there. 
Belgarath gave the Orb to the first Rivan King, saying that so long as one of his descendants held the Orb, the West would be safe. 
And the years passed, and the people gave thanks to their God, knowing that they were the chosen people of the Great God UL. 
She had never really intended for things to go this far when she and Master Jeebers had crept from the Imperial Palace in Tol Honeth that night so many weeks ago. 
He was a peasant, a scullion, a nobody. He was a nice enough boy, certainly, with rather plain, sandy hair that kept tumbling down across his forehead, making her fingers itch to push it back. 
He had a nice enough facein a plain sort of wayand he was somebody she could talk to when she was lonely or frightened, and somebody she could fight with when she felt peevish, since he was only slightly older than she was. 
Belgarath winced as he shifted his newly splinted arm. "You didn't have to be so rough, Pol." 
I think it's time you told us what happened, father," Lady Polgara was saying to her patient. 
"We located Zedar's trail and followed it down into Nyissa about three weeks ago. 
"There isn't a great deal more to it. 
Early this morning we were leading the horses through a patch of swamp. 
The only thing that even slightly humanized him was his overwhelming concern for horses. 
Did he say why the Master wants us to go to the Vale?" 
I know how to deal with that magician." 
To her, one jewel was much the same as another. 
At the moment, her only adornment consisted of a pair of tiny gold earrings shaped like little acorns, and her fondness for them arose not so much from the fact that they were gold but rather from the tinkling sound the cunningly contrived clappers inside them made when she moved her head. 
She thought perhaps that it was his seriousness that so piqued her curiosity and kept drawing her eyes to him. 
Was he such a lump that he didn't know how he was supposed to behave? 
She was definitely going to have to make him suffer extensively for that insulting lapse. Her fingers toyed absently with one of the curls cascading down the side of her face, her eyes boring into Garion's face. 
It's always been there," Garion was saying to his grandfather. 
He slapped her in the face," Garion told him. 
I hit him with my hand and said 'burn.' 
The whole point, though, is that you've always had this ability. 
She did, however, glance frequently his way to see if she could detect any signs of suffering. 
A few winsome littlegirl smiles, a bit of eyelash fluttering, and a spontaneousseeming kiss or two would wrap him neatly around one of her fingers. 
For one thing, Ce'Nedra was awed by the lady's spectacular beauty. 
We've never explored that particular boundary," Polgara replied, her needle still busy. 
I was wondering where this was leading," Polgara said, giving the tiny girl a penetrating look. 
Nothing you'd understand, dear," Polgara told him. 
She'll probably want to surprise me with my son when I get home. 
Belgarath came up on deck and joined the two bearded Chereks. 
She pursed her lips. 
Since the rapids of the River of the Serpent effectively blocked all further nagivation upriver, the trail leading up into the hills was quite broad, indicating that most travelers struck out overland at that point. 
Instead she rode forward along the column to ride with Baron Mandorallen, who led the way, as was his custom. 
She laughed. "My dear Baron, it's nothing important or serious just curiosity, and a way to pass the time as we ride." 
"Mistress Pol wants you to wait for a bit," he told them. 
Ce'Nedra had certain private suspicions about Durnik's feelings, but she kept them to herself. 
"How do the Arends regard Garion?" Ce'Nedra asked suddenly. 
I thought you were supposed to be the perfect man." 
She tried desperately to cling to her saddle with one hand and to control her terrified horse with the other, but its frantic flight took him under a low branch, and she was swept off its back to land unceremoniously in the middle of the trail. 
She was, after all, a princess, and he was only a liona very young and foolish lion. 
The yellow eyes fell on her then and narrowed slightly. 
The young lion's eyes widened with a sort of dreadful intensity, and he crouched, his belly going low to the ground. 
His teeth grated and ground as he gnawed and bit at Mandorallen's helmeted head. 
Say only what's in your heart. 
Don't say one thing and mean another. 
She sighed again. 
Then she suddenly laughed. "Dear, dear Durnik," she said. 
My husband will be rich and powerfulprobably much older than I amand my marriage to him will be to the advantage of the Empire and the House of Borune. 
"It might be nice, thoughto be able to choose for myself, I mean. 
There, there," he said, clumsily patting her shaking shoulder. "There, there." Chapter Three 
His Arendish thickheadedness might easily cause him to overlook the obvious. 
Which route are you planning to take to the Vale?" she asked him. 
Garion clenched his teeth together. 
A dozen or morecoming in from the west." 
"Do we fight?" he asked with a dreadful kind of eagerness, his hand going to his sabre. 
No," Wolf replied curtly. "We hide." 
Never mind, Hettar," Wolf told him. 
"One of them has a strange mind, but he doesn't seem to be a Grolim." Silk rode back quickly. "There's a thicket off to the right," he told them. 
He was moving quickly, but was careful to obliterate their trail completely. 
From behind them, Garion heard a faint snap and rustle in the leaves, and Ce'Nedra crawled up and sank to the ground at his side. 
Silk finished brushing away the tracks and stood for a moment studying the ground as he looked for any trace of their passage he might have missed. 
The Murgos killed his parents when he was very young. 
Their leader, however, was a man in a patched and dirty tunic and with coarse black hair. 
What's wrong, Silk?" Garion whispered to him. 
Fifteen Murgos," Silk replied shortly. 
"They said they were from Rak Hagga. 
He moved quickly toward his horse. 
Perhaps," the old man replied, "but we won't do that unless we have to. 
No one's doubting your courage, Mandorallen," Aunt Pol told him, "but the spirit of Mara wails in Maragor. 
One, a thin, unshaven man with a high forehead, wore a greasy Tolnedran jerkin. 
Berig picked up a rock and shied it at him. 
"One of these days I'm going to do him a favor and stick a knife in him," Berig remarked sourly. 
Berig laughed. "It suits me. 
You seem to know quite a bit about them, father," Aunt Pol noticed. 
Mandorallen's face went bleak, and his hand moved toward his sword hilt. 
"She obviously hasn't had much training yet. 
"This isn't what it seems to be." 
The whole region's alive with Murgos," Silk replied, climbing back on his horse. 
Kheran recommends that we get out of here immediately," Silk told Mister Wolf. 
Several dozen Nadraks boiled out of their shanties to confront a group of Murgo horsemen who had just ridden up out of a deep gully. 
"I don't have time for this right now." 
"I think he's about to leave on a very long journey." 
That way!" Barak shouted, pointing toward more level ground. 
They're very efficient." 
I've never been that curious about the peculiarities of Murgo culture," Barak replied. 
You're not serious," she said. 
At least, if we make the decision ourselves, we'll be able to take some precautions." 
I don't like it, father," she stated bluntly. 
As they passed into the belt of trees dotting the last low line of hills bordering the plain, Garion glanced back once. 
Murgos?" Hettar asked, his hand going to his sabre. 
After about a half mile, Mister Wolf raised his arm, and they all reined in. 
Behind it all, and seeming to carry and sustain all the other sounds, was a dreadful wailinga single voice surely, but so vast and allencompassing that it seemed to reverberate inside Garion's head, erasing all thought. 
Something flickered at the edge of his vision, but he refused to look. 
Then, enfolded in a comforting warmth, he fell almost at once into a profound slumber. 
In his search, he touched that quiet corner where the other mind stayed. 
He could almost sense its sardonic amusement. 
That term doesn't have any meaning in my case." 
You're different. 
The eyes were bulging, and the mouth was agape in a soundless scream. 
You'll know when the time comes. 
All right," Garion agreed. A very long time ago, something happened that wasn't supposed to happen," the voice in his mind began. 
It wasn't really a very big thing, but it just happened to be in the right place at the right timeor perhaps in the wrong place at the wrong time might be a better way to put it. 
"Up to that point there had always been only one possibilitythe original one. 
Let's take it one step further. 
"That's the whole reason I came into existence in the first place. In a very special way, you are the rock that I've thrown. 
Now they're starting to converge again. 
Even before the Gods." 
Only now there's another one, too, isn't there?" Garion suggested. 
You're the only one who can do what needs to be done, and it's the most important thing that will ever happennot just in this world but in all the worlds in all the universe. 
A decapitated figure stood in the trail, holding its head by the hair with its right hand. 
"Eight out of nine births were female. 
The society functioned; that's what counts." 
Somebody misinterpreted a passage in one of their sacred texts, that's all. 
Aunt Pol averted her eyes from the ghost of a child impaled on a Tolnedran spear. "And now no one has the gold," she said. 
Yes," Wolf agreed, lifting his face to listen to the dreadful wail that seemed to come from everywhere. 
Father!" Aunt Pol said sharply, pointing at the meadow beyond the fallen temple. 
A maimed ghost gibbered at him from the air in front of his face. 
"Oh, stop that!" he said irritably. 
He grew colder and he shivered, even as he told himself that the chilllike the wind and the grief laden howlingwas spiritual rather than real. 
This isn't the way to do it." 
"He's a God, after allbut it's still not good for him." 
The stones of the plaza were thick with the illusory memory of uncounted scores of Marag dead lying beneath rolling clouds of dense smoke. 
The figure towered and seemed to shimmer with a terrible presence, a reality that was in no way dependent upon the mind of the observer for its existence. 
Wilt thou then submit to his dominion, Lord Mara?" Aunt Pol asked him. 
"It holds no more joy for me, so let it perish. 
His expression registered a certain hopeless disgust. 
"Upon her will fall the brunt of my wrath." 
His dreadful, clutching fingers reached out toward the uncomprehending princess, but she stared blankly through him, unflinching and unaware. 
They're all asleep, Lord Mara," Wolf replied. 
And beyond that, he looked full in the face of time itselfseeing its beginning and its ending in one awful glimpse. 
"One day you will find joy again." 
Never," the God sobbed. 
Aunt Pol looked as if she wanted to say more, but she glanced once at the shadowy figure of the God weeping not far away and nodded. 
Wolf looked up quickly. 
Beldin can be very pompous sometimes." 
"One of the pack mares is with foal, Belgarath," he said. 
How long has she got to go?" Wolf asked, looking quickly at him. 
He went to one of the packhorses, came back with several large pieces of canvas, and quickly cut them into footwide squares. 
He hefted it a few times. "Looks about like a sackful of gold, wouldn't you say?" 
"There." He pointed with his chin at a spot where the slope of the bank was a bit more gradual. 
When they reached the spot, he turned his horse sharply. "Now!" he barked. 
I definitely want them to be thinking about casualties." 
He was a lean, pockmarked Sendar with a crude bandage wrapped around one leg, wearing a dirty green tunic. 
He unslung one of his bags of gravel from his saddle and shook it suggestively. 
Negligently he tossed the bag into the grass off to one side. 
Your men are having thoughts about mortality, Kroldor," Silk said dryly. 
They thumped their heels to their horses' flanks and charged through at a gallop. 
Their breath steamed in the damp cold. 
Ce'Nedra emerged from the tent she shared with Aunt Pol with a squeal of delight. 
Mister Wolf finally called a halt. "We're getting close to the western border of Cthol Murgos," he told them. 
Late that afternoon, the rain began to freeze as it hit, coating the rocks and trees with gray ice. They rounded a large outcropping of rock and found Silk waiting for them. 
"We have to go around this and then down the other side. 
It's only a couple of miles. 
The Grolims have turned their beasts loose, though. It's something we're going to have to watch out for." 
They rode on back down to the mouth of the draw and continued following the rim of the gorge. 
That gorge is getting narrower, Belgarath," Barak growled. 
Aunt Pol watched the birds with a look of stern disapproval, but said nothing. 
They rode on. 
Mister Wolf led them away from the gorge which separated them from Brill and his Murgos, moving steadily toward the northeast. 
He walked away from the last few embers of the dying fire and looked out into the darkness. 
I noticed that." 
What's that?" Garion asked, startled. 
THE WEATHER CONTINUED raw and unsettled as they rode for the next two days up the long, sloping rise toward the snowcovered summits of the mountains. 
They rode up the slope, their cloaks pulled tightly about them. 
Maybe there'll be something on the other side of the pass," Barak suggested, his beard whipping in the wind. 
Walking that way, he did not see the door until it was almost within reach of his hands. 
"There is a cave," he said back over his shoulder to the others. 
The door's as solid as the mountain itself," Barak said, hammering with his fist again. 
He ran his fingers over the icy iron, not knowing just what he was looking for. 
With a vast, grating groan, the door began to move. 
There were a few sparks, then a faint glow as the smith blew on his tinder. 
The tinder flamed, and he set it to the torch he had pulled from his saddlebag. 
The walls curved inward at they rose, and the ceiling high overhead seemed also to be round. 
"When the Gods were making the world, it was necessary for them to meet from time to time to discuss what each of them had done and was going to do so that everything would fit together and work in harmonythe mountains, the winds, the seasons and so on." 
He looked around. 
Silk, his nose twitching with curiosity, had climbed up onto the bench surrounding the huge table. 
"Seven of themand seven cups. 
Wolf turned then and looked at Garion, his eyes questioning. 
"I don't know. 
I don't think so. 
For some reason, it seems that I've always known this place was hereonly I didn't think about it until we started to get near it. 
Wolf looked as if he were about to ask another question, but just then there was a groan at the far end of the chamber. 
I'll need your help." 
He had a strange certainty that finding the cave was only the first part of whatever it was that was happening, There was something else he had to do, and his abstraction was in some way a preparation for it. It is not an easy thing to confess," Mandorallen was saying somberly. 
He started to creak to his feet. 
It's happened to me so often that I know exactly how it feels." Thou? 
Silk and Mister Wolf were standing beyond the huge stone table, peering into another of the circular openings in the shimmering wall. 
"I can't watch over you every minute." 
"Do you know what Aunt Pol would say to me if I did that without her permission?" 
"You're a sorceress. 
We can't reach beyond that barrier." 
The little princess wailed then and began to cry bitterly. 
Garion knelt and laid the foal on the floor in front of the shimmering fire. He put his hands on the tiny ribcage and pushed gently. "Breathe," he almost whispered. 
Garion began to gather his will. 
A miracle," Mandorallen said in a choked voice. 
His coat, which had been a deep, solid brown before Garion had touched him, was now marked on the shoulder with a single incandescently white patch exactly the size of the mark on Garion's palm. 
Garion found the attention of the little animal disturbing. 
Durnik nodded soberly. "You're probably right," he agreed. 
Mister Wolf put his hand lightly on the pitted iron, his eyes far away. 
"You drain yourself out completely, and you don't have enough strength left to keep your own heart beating." 
Don't you keep saying that nothing is impossible?" 
Actually, I think we've come a very long way," Wolf replied. 
Garion hung his head. "I didn't know what she was getting at," he apologized. That's because you weren't listening. 
Silk, who had been scouting ahead, came riding back to join them. "Belgarath," he said, "there's something about a mile in front of us that I think you'd better take a look at." 
"I don't believe in sorcery," she said flatly. 
And it's not like him to leave the packhorses unattended." 
"Were the Murgos some of those who were with Brill?" he asked. 
"They've been ridden hard, and there are whip cuts on them." 
How many days to the Vale?" Silk asked. 
The forests in the hills above Maragor had been thick with fir and spruce and heavy undergrowth. 
They passed through an area where the leaves on the scattered bushes were bright red; then, as they moved lower, the foliage turned first yellow, then green again. 
"Every bird we've passed for the last ten leagues has been babbling her name." 
Get back here right now!" 
"You were very young once yourself." 
I suppose he thought that was a way to show us that he was no longer a member of our' brotherhood. 
Maybe it's here to demonstrate the continuity of life." 
Coming, Garion?" 
Always before, there had been a sort of impromptu quality about the old man. 
I take care of it from time to time. 
"The stone is loose." 
"What's this, Grandfather?" he asked. 
Just be careful not to break anything," the old man warned. 
His efforts didn't really seem to be getting anywhere. Finally he stopped, staring at a low, roughlooking chair with the rail along its back, scarred and gashed as if it had been continually grasped by strong claws. 
As I recall, I was feeling rather sorry for myself at the time." 
As soon as I got inside, I started looking for things to steal." 
He changed my name from Garath to Belgarath, and he made me his pupil." 
It has to do with balance. 
When it starts to slow down, a few nearby stars fall. Their weight makes up the difference." 
"Not because she's any stronger than I am, but because she thinks differently than I do. 
Garion nodded. 
Garion glanced down through the window at the little horse friskily running through the field surrounding the tower. 
"All I did was reach through it." 
Such as what?" 
"I'm afraid this is going to take a very long time, Grandfather," he said. 
Garion sighed again. "No," he said, "I guess not." The old sorcerer put his arm around the boy's shoulders. "I thought you might see things that way, Belgarion. 
Somehow I knew that eventually you'd come around," Mister Wolf said. 
Don't you sometimes wish that I was just Garion again, and you were the old storyteller coming to visit Faldor's farmwith Aunt Pol making supper in the kitchen as she did in the old daysand we were hiding under a haystack with a bottle I'd stolen for you?" 
Sometimes, Garion, sometimes," Wolf admitted, his eyes far away. 
What choice did I have?" 
The voice in his mind didn't answer. 
His long hair and beard were whitefrom conscious choice, Garion felt, rather than from any result of age. 
There were differences, of course. 
She crossed to the fire, her feet seeming barely to touch the ground. Then she saw Aldur standing with the others and stopped, her eyes wide. 
The princess stared at the glowing presence in confusion. 
What are you going to do?" Garion asked her. 
"Gods, I think, have little notion of time," Barak replied sagely, stroking at his beard. 
The rock didn't budge. 
Garion set both hands on it and pushed again, but the rock remained motionless. 
It was rounded and white and not quite as high as his waist heavy, certainly, but it should not be so inflexibly solid. 
He bent over to look at the bottom, and then he understood. 
All right," he said finally, "now we know that that won't work." 
The force within him, amplified by that touch, built to a great roaring crescendo. 
Something else had also happened, however. 
With dismay, Garion realized that he had sunk up to his armpits in the firm soil of the meadow. 
He tried to wriggle, thinking that he might be able to loosen the earth around him and work his way up an inch at a time, but he could not so much as budge. 
Tell him that I'm in trouble." 
I don't want to talk about it," Garion muttered, somewhere between relief and total embarrassment. 
We could ask him, I suppose." 
"Most of us have sense enough to wait for guidance before we start rearranging local geography." 
I didn't know," Garion apologized. 
"If we go around saying 'push' or 'flop' or things like that, no one's ever going to take us seriously." 
Belgarath grunted, his face set in an expression of profound disapproval. Things didn't go well, I take it." 
He followed her about shamelessly, and the rather distant look he gave Garion showed not the slightest trace of guilt. 
Are they as remarkable as everyone says?" 
I think you're in for a bit of a disappointment," Aunt Pol told him rather primly. 
She turned her face to the thrush perched on her shoulder, singing adoringly. "Yes," she said to the bird, "I know." 
He turned to his brother. "That was very poetic," he said admiringly. 
The Dreadful Bear." 
can only be Belgarion," they said, their faces alive with joy, "the Chosen One." 
His shoulders were huge, and his hands dangled below his knees. 
You seem to be in a good humor today, Beldin," Belgarath said with no trace of sarcasm. 
I thought you were going to keep an eye on him. How did Belzedar get his hands on our Master's Orb?" 
"You're getting fat," he said bluntly. 
He chortled. 
Ce'Nedra, her face flaming, bolted out of earshot. 
When he had finished, he swilled down the contents of the tankard, belched thunderously, and sat back, scratching at his matted hair with gravysmeared fingers. "Let's get down to business," he said. 
"More or less," he replied indifferently. 
It was still blowing when I left." 
To the ruins of Cthol Mishrak in Mallorea, of course. 
"That's the one that worries me. 
ULGO Chapter Thirteen THE FOLLOWING MORNING they turned northwest and rode toward the stark, white peaks of the mountains of Ulgo, glittering in the morning sun above the lush meadows of the Vale. 
"He's so ugly." 
Who's that, dear?" 
When he was a child, his people drove him out because he was so deformed and hideous. 
Garion considered the exchange between his Aunt Pol and the princess as he rode. 
It was quite obvious that Aunt Pol had been telling the little girl something important, but whatever it was escaped him. 
At the top of a second, higher range, the trees had been swept bare, and the wind had the first bite of winter in it as it whistled down from the peaks. 
"Some years back, a dozen foolish young knights of my acquaintance rode into these mountains to test their bravery and prowess against the unseemly beasts. 
He dominates the whole herd. 
The stallion's shrill scream answered immediately. 
It sounds as if it's working," Barak observed. 
Mandorallen sounded his horn again, and again the stallion shrilled his reply. 
As the first Hrulga reared, his fangs bared in a catlike snarl and his clawed feet widespread, Mandorallen lowered his lance and drove it through the snarling monster's chest. 
They moved warily, circling, their eyes locked on each other with a deadly intensity. 
He shrugged regretfully. 
You wouldn't actually ride something like that?" Durnik's voice was shocked. 
We all have our little shortcomings," Silk admitted blandly. 
I don't suppose you'd consider doing something about the weather?" the little man asked hopefully. 
He stood up in his stirrups to look ahead. "Let's pick up the pace a bit," he called to Mandorallen, "and keep your eyes open." 
Aunt Pol's eyes grew distant as she probed the thickly forested sides of the valley with her mind. 
It's the first time I've been warm all day." Silk grinned, backing up to the fire. 
About the size of a donkey," Belgarath confirmed. 
Its forelegs were noticeably longer than its hind ones, giving it a peculiar, half erect stance, and there was a large, muscular hump across its shoulders. 
Its coat was a splotchy black and white, marked with a pattern hovering somewhere between spots and stripes. It paced nervously back and forth, staring at them with a dreadful intensity and yelping its highpitched, hooting laugh. 
A conical steel helmet, split up the back to make it fit, covered the brute's head. 
The Eldrak had virtually no nose, and its lower jaw jutted, showing two massive, protruding tusks. Its eyes were sunk in deep sockets beneath a heavy ridge of bone across its brow, and they burned with a hideous hunger. 
It talks?" Silk gasped incredulously. 
Why are you following us, Grul?" Belgarath demanded. 
Horses heremen. Plenty to eat." 
Come fight!" Grul roared, still beating on the ground with his club. 
All right," Barak agreed dubiously. 
He's quicker than I thought," Barak said. 
"Come fight!" he roared again. 
Grul turned back, raging now, with flecks of foam dripping from his pointed tusks. 
For a moment it looked as if their plan might work. 
The old gray wolf bounded across the fire and entered the fight, his great teeth flashing and tearing. 
Garion, I need you!" 
On the amulets. 
Mandorallen, his feet spread wide apart and holding the hilt of his broadsword with both hands, chopped steadily at the monster's body, his great blade shearing long rents in Grul's breastplate. 
Garion sat nearby with his head in his hands. 
"It's safe enough now. 
The two of them mounted and rode off through the snow. 
Let him sleep," she replied wearily. 
About a half hour later Silk and the princess returned. "It's a good spot," Silk reported. 
"It's a little chilly for standing around halfdressed." 
They promised to keep the wind off us, but only if we keep our fire strictly under control. I gave them my word." 
Ce'Nedra commanded them like a little general, snapping out her orders in a clear, firm voice. 
He began teaching the little colt a few simple tricks, though he had never attempted training animals before. 
Go away, Polgara," he told her. 
She died when you were born." 
"Just before we left." 
It took them two hours to wind their way to the top, and Garion was numb with cold by the time they got there. 
The wind seemed to batter at him, trying to pluck him off the ledge, and he made a special point of staying as far away from the edge as possible. 
They believe that UL himself placed it here." 
"They're opening the portal to the caves." 
Mar ishum Ulgo, " the unseen speaker said. 
The colt walked so close to Garion that they frequently bumped against each other, and Garion could feel the little animal's trembling with every step. 
There must be a lot of them down there," Barak observed, peering over the edge. Not necessarily," Belgarath told him. 
"Sound lingers in these caves, and the echoes keep coming back over and over again." 
The echo of the singing they had heard when they entered the cavern still lingered, curiously loud in some places and very faint in others. 
Like the men who had met them in the portal chamber, both were short and heavyshouldered. 
These men will care for them." 
Then Garion hurried to catch up to the others, who had already entered the mouth of one of the galleries. 
The Ulgos inside the cubicles continued at their tasks, paying no attention to the party passing in the gallery. 
The openings did not appear to have any systematic arrangement, but rather seemed scattered randomly. 
"I could be wrong, but it seems like we're going in a circle." We are." 
Garion glanced up also, and seemed to feel the weight of the mountain above pressing down firmly on him. 
An island rose from the center of the lake, and on the island stood a building constructed in the same curiously pyramidal shape as the buildings in the ruined city of Prolgu far above. 
The building was surrounded by a ring of columns, and here and there benches were carved from white stone. 
He had long, silvery hair and beard, and his robe was snowy white. 
I've outlived my time by three hundred years." 
Among the bowls sat several tall flasks and round crystal cups. 
It's chilly outside," Belgarath admitted. 
Our gatherers go out of the caves at night," the Gorim replied. 
"An innocent." 
I know that passage, Belgarath. 
Not only that, Anheg of Cherek found a copy of The Book of Torak that contains a fragment of a very old Grolim prophecy'Guard well the temple, above and beneath, for Cthrag Yaska will summon foes down from the air or up from the earth to bear it away again.' " 
The peculiar singing began again somewhere, echoing endlessly through the caves, and that too lulled her. 
She felt a little ashamed that he had been the one who'd had to suffer from her bad temper. 
Understandably. 
"Ulgo will never leave the caves now. 
The Gorim was sitting directly across the narrow stone table from Ce'Nedra. 
"She's a BoruneI'm sure you've heard of the link between that house and the Dryads. 
A serviceable God," the Gorim said. 
I hope that someday soon I may receive instruction concerning him. 
Ce'Nedra definitely felt that the dear old man was becoming just a bit tiresome about the whole thing. 
After a few moments of chagrin, however, she began to feel the strangely compelling quality of his story. 
And he departed from Prolgu and returned unto" 
"You see what I mean about him? 
Trying to convince him of anything is impossible." 
Relg glared at him. "I speak your language, foreigner," he said with towering contempt, "but I choose not to defile the holy caverns with its unsanctified mouthings." 
The Gorim's eyes narrowed, and he rose to his feet. 
Why have you summoned me here?" Relg demanded. 
I will remain here in the service of UL and of the child who will become Gorim of Ulgo. 
And if you try to compel me, my followers will not permit it." 
"Watch closely, hairy one." 
"What we see as solid isn't really all that impenetrable." 
"Relg can slip the bits and pieces that make up his substance through the spaces that exist between the bits and pieces that make up the substance of the rock." 
Can you do it?" Silk demanded skeptically. 
The glow in the rock wall which Ce'Nedra had noticed before began to shimmer and pulsate, and the princess seemed to see a dim shape within the rocks. 
The figure looked calmly at the groveling zealot. 
"Rise, Relg," it said in a soft voice that seemed to carry all the echoes of eternity in it, and the caverns outside rang with the sound of that voice. 
"Rise, Relg, and serve thy God." 
"Thou hast turned my words to make them conform to thy desire, rather than to my will." 
"He's touched the edges of it, however, and what he's shown us so far gives us hope for his success." 
It is to speak with thee that I have come, my daughter," UL said directly to her then, and his tone and face grew serious. 
Belar!" Barak breathed explosively. 
Good," Belgarath replied, and then he went directly to the point. 
"At any rate, once we've recovered the Orb, we'll go back down through the caves and make a run for it." 
If any army of Murgos inadvertently follows us into the West, it will be viewed as an invasion, and that will start a war we aren't ready for yet. 
He looked around. 
Turn them all into frogs," Barak suggested with a shrug. 
"I wish but to refresh my memory concerning the contiguity of certain other realms upon the borders of Cthol Murgos. 
That's right," Belgarath replied. 
Mandorallen winced and put his hand to his injured ribs. 
He turned with surprise, and she stretched up on her tiptoes, took his face between her tiny hands and kissed him. 
There seemed to be no purpose to the twisting, turning route Relg followed. 
I have to cover my eyes here," Relg replied. 
How can you tell which way to go if you're blindfolded?" Silk protested. 
The horses, plodding along at the rear, had also caught the scent of fresh air, and their pace quickened. 
With a sudden clatter of little hooves, the colt, ignoring Hettar's sharp command, bolted for the opening and plunged out into the light. 
Belgarath scratched at his whiskers, squinting after the little animal. 
The plain reached to the horizon, and Garion felt as if he had just awakened from a nightmare. 
How longs he going to be at it?" 
It's probably going to take us at least a month to get to Rak Cthol and back," Belgarath advised. 
"But I'll miss him all the same." Which direction do we take?" 
At least we'll be able to count on his staying sober," Aunt Pol observed primly. 
Barak coughed uncomfortably. 
Quite suddenly Garion understood. 
She made a quick gesture that told him to keep talking. "It's not empty," he floundered. 
I really wish you wouldn't." 
Somehow, even in the midst of his panic, Relg had been suffering the horrors of a theological crisis. 
"You'll hurt yourself. 
What's this all about?" 
Who has the power to forbid anything to UL?" 
Relg's eyes burned with a sudden hope. 
I've had impure thoughts about women." 
I'm sure that UL understands. 
Punish me, Belgarion," Relg pleaded. 
"I can't punish youany more than I can forgive you. 
Then with a strangled cry he lurched to his feet and fled wailing into the darkness. 
He said that he'd committed all kinds of sins," Garion explained. 
"He wanted me to punish him and forgive him." 
About something like that?" 
Garion was horrified at the thought. 
I need him, Garion, and he can't function if he's incapacitated by some kind of religious hysteria. 
I don't care what you have to do, but keep him from flying apart again." 
Not exactly a secret," Silk replied. 
One gets the feeling that you've had occasion to leave just about every place in a hurry at one time or another." Silk shrugged. 
Mandorallen, stop that," Aunt Pol told him. 
There's a ford a few miles upstream," Belgarath said in answer to the question. 
The trickle of water running down the cut made everything slick and muddy. 
I feel as if somebody's been beating me with a stick," Barak groaned, sinking to the ground in the brushy gully at the top of the cut. 
"I'll have a look around," Silk said after only a few moments. 
The small man had the body of an acrobatsupple, strong, and quick to restore itself. 
Company," Silk replied shortly, pointing out over the rocky, arid plain lying brown and dead under the flat gray sky. A cloud of yellow dust, whipped low to the ground by the stiff, chill wind, gave evidence of riders. 
Ah," Silk said with a peculiar kind of sadness. 
They're Grolims," Silk explained. 
"The one they're chasing is a Thull trying to escape being sacrificed. 
They almost never try to hide," Silk said in a soft voice tinged with pity. 
Garion's stomach wrenched at the thought of the dreadful height of the escarpment. 
Barak looked longingly after the three Grolims, then sighed with deep regret. 
Let's go back down," Silk said. 
Silk turned back to Relg. 
Relg's face was troubled as he struggled with the blunt description of the horror of Thullish life. 
I think we've just about exhausted the possibilities of this conversation, father," Aunt Pol suggested, "and we have a long way to go." 
They rode down through the arid jumble of rock and scrubby bushes that spread across the western frontier of the land of the Thulls. 
We're getting close to the northern edge of Cthol Murgos," Silk said, pointing ahead at a low range of hills. 
They'll watch us," Silk admitted, "but they won't interfere as long as we don't stray from the track. 
After about a league or so, Relg began to pull in his horse. Not now, Relg," Belgarath told him sharply. 
Is that swine Kador from Tol Vordue still dominant?" 
It was snowing when we came through." 
I'd stay out of Rak Goska," Kalvor advised. 
"I don't have any other choice, do I?" 
The clouds overhead turned the sky a dirty slategray, but what moisture they held did not fall on this desiccated wilderness of sand, rock, and scrubby thorn. 
The Murgos give them plenty of time to realize how wrong they were." 
Unfortunately, Murgos automatically assume that anybody who isn't on the track itself is a bandit." 
The information the Tolnedran merchant had given them about the makeshift fair at the halfway point proved to be accurate. On the afternoon of the third day, they came over a rise and saw a cluster of tents surrounding a solid stone building set to one side of the caravan track. 
"It's his punishment for my sins." 
He had coarse, black hair and a thin, scraggly beard. 
"Haven't they caught you yet, Silk?" he demanded raucously. 
I thought your fat king needed you in Gar og Nadrak." 
Your sense of humor's as overpowering as ever, Yarblek." 
This is Mistress Pol, Yarblek," Silk introduced her. 
You'd slice open my belly if I tried to steal you, wouldn't you?" 
"I thought you didn't like Murgos." 
I'd even offer to help, but I'd probably better keep my nose out of it. 
"Confusion to the Murgos." 
He drank deeply, scooped another cupful of ale from the open keg and drank again. 
Where are you going?" Belgarath asked quickly. 
Do you want me to go with him?" Barak asked Belgarath. 
He chuckled then. "It must have been something pretty awful, the way the little thief ran out of here." 
War?" Mandorallen demanded sharply. 
Durnik pulled aside the red carpeting that hung along the back wall, reached down, and tugged out several tent pegs. He lifted the canvas. 
Barak and Garion scrambled up out of the gully and moved at a crouch to the top of the hill, where they lay down behind a scrubby bush. 
In their midst, astride a black horse and under a flapping black banner, rode Taur Urgas. 
A kind of chainmail hood covered the back and sides of the king's neck and spread out over his shoulders. When he reached the open area directly in front of the square stone supply post, Taur Urgas reined in his horse. "Wine!" he commanded. 
Barak snorted with contempt. 
He drew a roll of parchment out of one sleeve and handed it up to his ruler. 
Your Majesty," Yarblek replied with a slight bow. 
"My soldiers have certain orders, and some of them might fail to recognize a fellow Angarak in their eagerness to obey my commands. 
Barak's eyes went flat. Brill bowed to Taur Urgas with an unexpected grace. "Hail, Mighty King," he said. 
He reached out, roughly grasped the prisoner's hair, and jerked his head up for the king to see. 
His face was pale, and a deep cut on one side of his forehead trickled blood down the side of his face. Behold the Drasnian spy Kheldar." Brill smirked. 
Your gift is beyond price." 
Abide here a bit, Prince of Drasnia," Taur Urgas gloated. 
"They all talked for a while, and then several soliders took him around behind that building down there. 
"How did you find us?" You left the pegs pulled up at the back of my tent, and this hill's the closest cover on this side of the fair. 
"Taur Urgas will be putting out patrols soon, and you're almost in his lap." We must rescue our companion first," Mandorallen told him. 
He squatted and pulled a curved dagger from beneath his overcoat. 
Pay is a magic word when you're dealing with Tolnedrans." 
He's going to massacre the whole camp?" Barak sounded stunned. 
It won't do you any good," Yarblek told him. 
All of stinking Cthol Murgos is mostly rock." 
"You don't have time." 
"I wish I could do something for Silk." 
There isn't much hope, I'm afraid. 
Yarblek grinned at him and shook his hand. Then he turned and caught Aunt Pol in a rough embrace. 
I'll keep that in mind, Yarblek," she replied demurely. Luck," Yarblek told them. 
Barak and Mandorallen stared at him. 
You know that, don't you?" 
"They're preoccupied. 
The night was murky, and the wind bit at them as they came out from between the protecting gravel banks. 
Relg grunted and covered his eyes with his hands. 
You'd better have Aunt Pol give you something for that cold. 
He leaned forward and put his tongue to the granite face, seeming actually to taste the rock. 
The wind moaned and whistled around the rocks on the flanks of the stony hill, and the sparse thornbushes rustled stiffly. 
I didn't particularly feel like being arrested, so I argued with the soldiers a bit. 
They had all begun to look at Relg in a somewhat different light since his rescue of Silk. 
"He found waterice actually. 
I don't think it could go through the rock. 
I don't think it has a name," Belgarath answered calmly. 
We'd better take shelter," Belgarath shouted over the shrieking wind. 
"If we go to the leeward side, it will keep the wind off us." 
No," Belgarath shouted. 
They reached the rock pile and dismounted. 
Garion moved over to stand beside the praying fanatic. "It will be all right, Relg," he told him. 
A thick plume was rising from one of them, towering into the air, boiling up in great black billows as it rose. 
The force that's causing that eruption is enormous. 
The bony shapes appeared almost to be swimming up out of the black sand, and the cold, empty eye sockets seemed somehow hungry as they galloped past. 
Although the wind had died, it was still bitterly cold, and firewood was scanty. 
The Tarn of Cthok was a vast, shallow pond filled with oilylooking water that reeked like all the dead fish in the world. 
Its surface steamed in the icy air, and the wisps of steam gagged them with the dreadful stink. 
Ground that looks firm quite often won't be, and there are some other things we'll need to watch out for. 
Stop!" he said sharply. 
He kicked his horse's flanks, and they galloped past the stillheaving surface of the pool, the hooves of their horses splashing in the hot mud that had splattered across their path. 
I didn't hear anything." 
Garion's horse put one front hoof on the seemingly solid ground, and the hoof sank out of sight. 
They moved on, carefully picking their way through the quagmires and quicksand, stopping often as more geyserssome of mud, some of frothy, boiling watershot high into the air. 
"It's just around the southern edges of the Tarn." 
It's much longer if you do, and the bog helps to discourage pursuit." 
You're going to hurt them," Garion told him. 
The rock against which the Grolim was pinned seemed to shimmer slightly around him. 
He'll bring others." 
Why didn't you cut him down with your axe?" I don't really like hitting people," Durnik replied. 
"I am sorry about the horse, though." Chapter Twentyfour THE NEXT MORNING they followed the ridgeline that angled off toward the east. 
Several times they saw dust clouds far out on the desolation of sand and salt flats to the south, but they were unable to determine whether the clouds were caused by Murgo patrols or vagrant winds. About noon, the wind shifted and blew in steadily from the south. 
That's a bad storm coming, Belgarath," Barak rumbled, staring at the cloud. 
Barak made a face, then shrugged. "At least we won't have to worry about being seen, once it starts," he said. 
"We'll have to take steps to deal with that, I suppose." 
How does it look, father?" she asked the old man. 
In spite of the chill, he felt sweat standing out on his forehead. 
"You enclose yourself in the idea of sand and rock, and it merges with the real sand and rock all around us. 
Go out slowly, a few feet at a time." 
Then the first specks of drifting ash began to settle down through the icy air, as Belgarath led them down off the ridge and out onto the sand flats. 
It was no longer necessary to concentrate all his attention on it as it had been at first. By the end of the second hour, it had become no more than tedious. 
"If it blows over, we'll have to start dodging patrols again." The old man nodded. "We'd better hurry," he agreed. 
"There's a place I know of where we can hideabout five miles north of the city. 
You can see for ten leagues in any direction from the walls of Rak Cthol." 
"They're trying to penetrate the screen." 
If one of them does manage to break through, I'm going to tell you to stop. 
When I say stop, I want you to erase the image immediately and put your mind completely away from it." 
It doesn't matter. 
"He jumped off something very high. 
"You were holding on so tight I couldn't break loose. 
"They know we're out here now, and there'll be others looking for us." 
We can hide here until dark," Belgarath said, dismounting behind the ridge. 
I thought that was just a mountain." 
Are there caves?" 
I don't know," Belgarath admitted, sounding terribly disappointed. 
We'll come up with something," Barak told him. Silk shook his head stubbornly. "No passing through rock," he declared adamantly. 
"It's large and it goes up." 
"It might be the one we want. 
"Only half of him's still sticking out." 
You have absolutely no idea." 
"The opening's about a half mile farther along. 
"It goes up. 
Sorry," Barak mumbled. 
There's going to be some climbing involved," Relg told them after they had pushed the last horse inside and stood in the total blackness of the cave. 
This will give you enough light to see where you're going." 
"You'll find some holes in the rock you can use to climb up." 
It's a bit difficult to explain," Relg replied. 
It leads to another gallery." 
They followed it toward the center of the peak, passing several passageways opening to the sides. 
From somewhere along one of the dark passageways, a voice floated out at them, singing. 
She thinks it's a trick," the old man told them quietly. 
"She says she's got a knife right against her heart, so we're going to have to be careful." 
Belgarath knelt beside the exhausted woman. "You're a Marag, aren't you?" he asked her intently. 
Her dark hair fell across one of her pale cheeks in a shadowy tangle. 
"Some cheese," he said, "and a bit of dried meat." 
Have you any idea how your people came to be here?" Belgarath asked the slave woman. "Think. It could be very important." 
She gave a bitter little laugh. "I don't think so. 
"I've been cold for such a long time." 
Belgarath and Aunt Pol were looking at each other across Taiba's body. 
Everything fits together too wellright down to the last detail." 
The slave pens, most likely," Belgarath replied. 
How far do we go before we start running into Murgos?" Barak rumbled, looking around with his hand on his sword hilt. 
Coming, Mandorallen?" The knight nodded gravely, loosening his sword in its sheath. "We'll wait here, then," Belgarath told them. 
THE MURGO ROBE was made of coarse, black cloth and it had a strange red emblem woven into the fabric just over Garion's heart. It smelled of smoke and of something else even more unpleasant. 
"I'll have a look," he whispered and slipped out. 
A scream, agonized and despairing, echoed through the city, followed after a moment by the hollow sound of some unimaginably huge iron gong. 
"We're going to have to hurry. Morning isn't far off." 
It was as if the Murgos and Grolims who lived here had no sense of personal possession, so that their structures lacked that insularity of individual property to be found among the houses in the cities of the West. 
Are you sure you know where you're going?" Barak whispered nervously to Belgarath. 
"I like to keep an eye on Ctuchik from time to time. 
They climbed silently. 
After a few moments, Aunt Pol and Mandorallen followed. 
I knew that I'd catch you alone someday," Brill said, ignoring the sword. 
Then, so fast that Garion could not follow, Brill dodged back and struck his hand down sharply on the boy's forearm. 
Then another shadow flickered in the darkness at the corner of the tower. Brill grunted as a foot caught him solidly in the side. 
I suppose I should have expected you too, Kordoch," Silk replied. 
"How do you keep getting ahead of us?" he asked, almost conversationally. 
He sounded interested. 
Brill flicked a jab at Silk's face that was an ounce or two harder than it should have been and traveled no more than a fraction of an inch too far. Silk's hands flashed up and caught his opponent's wrist with a deadly grip and he rolled backward toward the parapet, his legs coiling, even as the two of them fell. 
His grin was a flash of white teeth in the shadows. 
Isn't it, though?" Silk agreed. 
If anybody speaks to us, let me do the talking; and each time the gong sounds, turn toward the altar and bow." 
He looked back once to be sure they were all in line, then put his hand to the latch and pushed the door open. 
Along the back wall of the balcony were a number of doors, set deep in the stone. 
Garion surmised that the balcony was largely used by Temple functionaries going to and fro on various errands. 
Awkwardly, sickened by the horror below, Garion also bowed. 
Do as he says, Garion, "Aunt Pol's voice sounded quietly in his mind. 
The unspoken recognition passed between Aunt Pol's mind and that strange other mind as Garion helplessly let the anger and the will drain out of him. 
"Even now the earth gathers to rid itself of it."And then the voice was gone. 
The Grolim grunted suspiciously. 
They filed past the steelmasked Grolim, their heads down and their hands crossed on their breasts, muttering to themselves as if in prayer. Vile!" Relg was strangling. 
Keep your head down!" Silk whispered. 
He tugged the latch carefully, and the door opened smoothly. 
He started down again with Barak and Mandorallen close behind him. 
Torches illuminated the bottom of the stone steps and a kind of antechamber hewn from the solid rock. 
Barak's massive shoulder shifted, and there was a grating crunch as the bones in the first Grolim's neck came apart in his deadly grip. 
He pointed at the two dead guards. 
Bright yellow coinsgold beyond countinglay in heaps on the floor; carelessly scattered among the coins were rings, bracelets, chains, and crowns, gleaming richly. 
"He has some rather exotic perversions, doesn't he?" he remarked with a shudder. 
A black stone altar stood in the first room on the top level of the turret, and the steel image of the face of Torak brooded from the wall behind it. 
The stone floor was uncarpeted, and the round windows looking out into the darkness were undraped. 
Seated at the table with his back to the door sat a man in a hooded black robe who seemed to be gazing into an iron cask. 
A few minor delays, Ctuchik," Belgarath replied. 
It's been a long time coming, Ctuchik." Hasn't it, though? 
They're fine just where they are," Belgarath told him. 
Surely you're not going to deny me the opportunity to pay homage to the Queen of the World." 
It doesn't really matter now, you know," Ctuchik almost purred. 
You wouldn't have dared to leave her behind. 
"The others are all unassailable. Ce'Nedra's the only vulnerable one, and she's at Prolguunder the protection of UL himself. 
He betrayed himself, Ctuchik, and I think that haunts him sometimes. 
The little blond boy, seeming to know that they were discussing him, looked at the two old men, his eyes filled with absolute trust. 
"If you try to take it, I'll fight you. 
But Torak's been asleep for five centuries now, and the world's run fairly well without him. 
I don't imagine there's all that much point in disturbing him just yet." 
Garion knew that, had it been directed at him, it would have destroyed him. 
Now grimfaced, Belgarath still faced his ancient enemy. Is that the best you can do, Ctuchik?" he asked, even as his own will struck. 
Beyond thought now, Belgarath and Ctuchik, consumed with their hatred for each other, were unleashing forces that could kill them all. 
"Get backall of you. The air around them is alive." 
Then Garion's eyes fell upon the little boy. 
Holding the gray stone in both hands like a ball, the little boy turned and walked directly toward Garion, his eyes filled with trust and the expression on his small face confident. 
It seemed instead to pull out, drawing at him as it closed about the horrified Ctuchik. 
The High Priest of the Grolims shrieked mindlessly. 
The blast had thrown him halfway across the room, and he lay in a stunned heap, his eyes glazed and his hair and beard singed. 
The turret began to shudder, and the basalt pinnacle from which it hung swayed. 
Barak and Mandorallen rushed up the stone stairs. 
"Pick him up," she snapped at Barak. 
"Can you open it? 
Barak jumped across, and his feet scrambled for an awful second on the very edge of the far side. 
With the little boy in his arms he literally flew across the awful gap and crashed directly into Barak's broad back. 
The major goal to which unbelievers are committed is the attainment of happiness and peace “in this world.” 
For others, on the other hand, becoming a respected and wellknown person is the purpose of life; they will do anything and make any sacrifices to earn public respect. 
The fact is, however, that Allah creates life and likewise takes it away. 
…Allah will guide to the ways of peace those who follow what pleases Him. He will bring them by His will from darkness to the light, and will guide them to a straight path. 
This is the most important trait that makes a Muslim different from all other people. 
That is why a hypocrite’s prayers are of a “pretentious” nature (Surat alMa‘un: 6) while Muslims pray in humility (Surat alMu’minun: 12). 
Similarly, while Muslims spend their money in Allah’s cause, hypocrites spend to impress people rather than to earn Allah’s approval. 
He who desires this fleeting existence shall soon receive in it whatever We will: We bestow Our gifts upon whoever We please. But then We will consign him to Hell where he will roast, reviled and helpless. 
That is because had been there any question of “easy gains,” hypocrites might also perform any deed which has the appearance of being in compliance with Allah’s Will—and not the actual deed with which Allah will be pleased—to attain this “easy gain”: 
Paradise is the abode of those who “believe with certainty” in Allah and the hereafter (Surah Luqman: 4) and then “strive with all due striving” in the way of Allah. 
Our Lord promises believers that He will give a good life to His believing servants in this world, too. Yet this in no way means that they will not encounter any hardship and troubles in this world. 
Will you not use your intellect?” 
We said, “Fire, be coolness and peace for Ibrahim!” 
The fact that no harm will befall those who are not afraid to lose anything as they strive for the cause of Allah and that they will attain many material and spiritual rewards are underlined in the Qur’an in a passage which extols the faith of believers even when on the brink of defeat in battle: 
The soul unceasingly tempts a person and never earns him Allah’s approval. As it does all these things it tries to present alluring alternatives. 
Seeing this definition, some people may raise the objection, “We already do not associate a partner with Allah,” although it may actually be the case that they do. 
Indeed, the Qur’an relates the case of many people who associate partners with Allah—that is, who are idolaters—yet who never accept this situation: 
On the Day We gather them all together, We will say to those who associated others with Allah, “Where are the partnergods, for whom you made such claims?” 
The fact, however, is that, the attributes (power, intelligence, beauty and so on) which we ascribe to other beings do not actually belong to them; they are endowed with them by Allah for a temporary and specified period of time. 
Once this fact is denied and people start thinking that some beings can exist of their own accord without Allah’s sustenance, idolatry surfaces. 
With such a mindset, one forgets that every living thing is under the control of Allah. A false belief about the existence of some beings who do not need Allah emerges. 
You alone we worship. You alone we ask for help. 
That is because the beings they take as deities are also feeble servants like themselves. 
Those whom you call upon besides Allah are not even able to create a single fly, even if they were to join together to do it. 
And if a fly steals something from them, they cannot get it back. 
They do not measure Allah with His true measure. 
People pin their hopes on these deities and accept their judgements as true. 
This is how a man becomes subservient to millions of imaginary deities. 
However, one who associates partners with Allah is at an impasse and his loss is, therefore, very great. This fact is related in the Qur’an as follows: 
Furthermore, acting in compliance with the desires of the soul is defined in the Qur’an as setting up partners with Allah: 
Say: “My prayer and my rites, my living and my dying, are for Allah alone, the Lord of all the worlds.” 
In the face of two groups of enemies, believers preferred to fight against the weaker of the two. 
Muslims should determine the best course to follow in this struggle they take upon themselves and then carry it out with commitment. Yet, even if one has the strength to shoulder this responsibility, if one involves oneself with issues of no great urgency only to satisfy one’s own desires, that will only incur the displeasure of Allah. 
He is someone who has been chosen by Allah and to whom faith has been granted; he is held responsible for extirpating wrongdoing from society, replacing it with peace, and establishing an environment where everyone lives by Allah’s religion. 
An evil generation has succeeded them, inheriting the Book, taking the goods of this lower world, and saying, “We will be forgiven.” 
But if similar goods come to them again they still take them. 
But if I should be sent back to my Lord, I will definitely get something better in return.” 
Our Lord, do not cause our hearts to go astray after You have guided us. And grant us mercy. 
This will lead him either to eternal terrible ruin or to eternal salvation. 
It would certainly be unwise to pursue some other course or to remain heedless while there is such a great event ahead of him. 
For his salvation, a believer is responsible for seeking “what pleases Allah most.” 
You have just the right amount of money to take you to the top floor. 
Would you give all the money you have to go to the top, or remain at a lower storey which is vulnerable to the torrent? 
For a moment, let’s assume that you are on the edge of hell, around which people will be gathered on the Day of Judgement and witness its stunning images. 
And did not the warner come to you? 
In the Qur’an, the great difference between believers and other people in this sense is stated as follows: 
Some people set up equals to Allah, loving them as they should love Allah. 
As in the case of a human being, all creatures that deserve love are created by Allah and made “pretty.” 
Consequently, his actual love is for Allah, the One Who provides him with everything he loves: He is the real Owner of every kind of beauty. 
As the verses above make it clear, the love of a believer rests on no criterion other than the “love felt for Allah.” 
The sole purpose in marrying will be to gain Allah’s approval. 
But if you desire Allah and His Messenger and the abode of the hereafter, Allah has prepared an immense reward for those among you who do good works.” 
Due to their faith in Allah, believers are granted some attributes that make them worthy of love. 
• They fear Allah. 
• They fear no one but Allah. 
• They resort to various methods to convey Allah’s message and to summon people to Allah’s religion. 
The ruling circle of those of his people who were disbelievers said: “This is nothing but a human being like yourselves who simply wants to gain ascendancy over you…” (Surat alMu’minun: 2324) 
Another slander believers are very often exposed to is that of “insanity.” 
...He was a saintly man and a Prophet. 
They have taken [other] gods besides Allah [Alone], hoping that they may be helped. 
They cannot help them, even though they are an army mobilised in their support. 
Unlike Islam, the one and immutable law of Allah, theirs is a polytheistic religion. 
This being the case, the polytheistic religions they abide by take various forms. 
Unable to fulfil his infinite needs and desires by himself, by nature, he tends to turn to Allah alone. 
Accordingly, the nature of man is inclined to recognise Allah as his Lord: 
This aside, from the Qur’an and the sunnah of the Prophet (saas) a believer learns the facts of which disbelievers are utterly unaware. For example, Allah has given the glad tidings that for whoever observes his duty to Allah, He will provide a means of salvation: 
… Whoever goes in fear of Allah—He will give him a way out and provide for him from where he does not expect. 
A believer who duly acknowledges the power of Allah will dedicate his life to Him, because he knows that Allah will be enough for “whoever puts his trust in Him.” 
This is his duty and his “profession.” 
I only created jinn and man to worship Me. 
At this time too, they turn to others and pin their hopes on them. 
Yet those they turn to are also weak individuals who only think about their own benefit. Moreover, they are far from being merciful and compassionate. 
For this reason, even a minor disagreement among them is likely to develop into a clash or conflict. 
According to their misguided idea, they assume they have to develop a tough, aggressive and egoist character to be able to survive in this “jungle.” 
The Qur’an calls these societies “ignorant and behavent,” because they are entirely unaware of Allah and the hereafter. 
However, as mentioned earlier, “the society of ignorance” is not of a uniform nature. 
Muslims take “taqwa” (awe or fear of Allah which inspires the individual to be on guard against wrong actions and eager for ones which please Him) as the only criterion by which to appraise people. 
And do good as Allah has been good to you. And do not seek to cause corruption in the land. 
He went out among his people in all his finery. 
Those who desired the life of the world said: “Oh! If only we had the same as Qarun has been given! 
If Allah had not shown great kindness to us, we would have been swallowed up as well. 
The relevant verse about this issue is as follows: 
Say: “My Lord gives abundantly to whom He wills or sparingly to whom He pleases. 
His companion, with whom he was conversing, said to him, “Do you then disbelieve in Him Who created you from dust, then from a drop of sperm, and then formed you as a man? 
The fruits of his labour were completely destroyed and he woke up wringing his hands in grief, rueing everything that he had spent on it. 
In the Qur’an, this segment of society is defined with phrases such as “arrogant chiefs of the people,” “those who led lives of ease,” “those persisting in immense wrongdoing” and “those who were unjustly proud in the land.” 
Did they not see that Allah, Who created them, had greater strength than them? 
Such an understanding permits the commission of morally unacceptable acts in an environment where no one hears or witnesses them. 
We have prepared for them a painful punishment. 
Before them there shall stand a barrier until the Day they are raised up. 
What will be taken to the hereafter are the good deeds and acts of worship done to earn the approval of Allah. 
Those who place no hope in the hereafter wish to have children who will carry the family name into the future. 
However, when we refer to the Qur’an, we witness the attitude of true believers; they ask for children from Allah only if this is necessary for the pleasure of Allah. 
The religion brought by the Qur’an and embodied in the exemplary life of the Prophet (saas), however, bears no similarity whatsoever to these. 
Say: “Who has forbidden the fine clothing Allah has produced for His servants and the good kinds of provision?” 
Allah does not love people who overstep the limits. 
This is the definition of a Muslim. 
What an evil destination! 
The people of the fire wear shirts of tar there. 
There is no cold or heat that would disturb one. 
There are rivers of water and rivers of milk there. 
There are couches lined with rich brocade. 
This theory, which argues that life originated from inanimate matter through coincidences, has been demolished with the recognition that the universe was created by Allah. 
In this book, Darwin denied that different living species on the earth were created separately by Allah. 
1) The theory can by no means explain how life originated on the earth. 
This, however, is a claim inconsistent with even the most unassailable rules of biology. 
The first evolutionist who took up the subject of the origin of life in the twentieth century was the renowned Russian biologist Alexander Oparin. 
After a long silence, Miller confessed that the atmosphere medium he used was unrealistic.5 
Today as we leave the twentieth century, we still face the biggest unsolved problem that we had when we entered the twentieth century: How did life originate on Earth?6 
Thus, natural selection fell out of favour as an evolutionary mechanism. 
In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the “Modern Synthetic Theory”, or as it is more commonly known, NeoDarwinism, at the end of the 1930's. 
For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a random change in the framework of the building which, in all probability, would not be an improvement.10 
Natural selection, on the other hand, “can do nothing by itself” as Darwin also accepted. 
According to the evolutionist claim, the living beings in the Homo series are more developed than Australopithecus. 
However, recent findings of paleoanthropologists have revealed that Australopithecus, Homo habilis and Homo erectus lived at different parts of the world at the same time.16 
A paleontologist from Harvard University, Stephen Jay Gould, explains this deadlock of the theory of evolution although he is an evolutionist himself: 
Lord Solly Zuckerman, one of the most famous and respected scientists in the U. K., who carried out research on this subject for years, and particularly studied Australopithecus fossils for 15 years, finally concluded, despite being an evolutionist himself, that there is, in fact, no such family tree branching out from apelike creatures to man. 
At the far end of the spectrum, which is the part considered to be most “unscientific,” are “extrasensory perception”—concepts such as telepathy and sixth sense—and finally “human evolution.” 
Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 
Moreover, that materialism is absolute, so we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door. 
Never before has any other belief or idea so taken away peoples' powers of reason, refused to allow them to think intelligently and logically and hidden the truth from them as if they had been blindfolded. 
They are the unaware. 
Even if We opened up to them a door into heaven, and they spent the day ascending through it, they would only say, “Our eyesight is befuddled! Or rather we have been put under a spell!” 
In fact, Allah reveals in the Qur'an in the incident of the Prophet Musa (as) and Pharaoh that some people who support atheistic philosophies actually influence others by magic. 
As we can see from that verse, when it was realised that what these people who had first cast a spell over others had done was just an illusion, they lost all credibility. 
You are the AllKnowing, the AllWise.” 
The first one is the EXECUTIVE SUMMARY which is called examples of common problems and suggested solutions. 
suppliers' contracts negotiating and documenting, 
Initially focus specific attention on : 
The earlier payment terms are mentioned to the client, the easier the collection job afterwards 
New clients should receive a significant amount of pressure in this area. 
Bringing that day forward as much as possible is of the upmost importance. 
Supporting documentation : 
Clients also used this as an excuse to hold up total payment although the error or omission represented only a small part of the invoice. 
Once some form of quality control was introduced, the collections improved significantly, particularly with multinational clients. 
Persistent problem/slow payers always require special attention.

But when the last of them had gone he at once began to prepare to drive over to see a neighbouring proprietor about a grove which he had been bargaining over for a long time. He was now in a hurry to start, lest buyers from the town might forestall him in making a profitable purchase. 
You serv me and I don't neglect you." 
What, feeling lonely, feeling lonely, little silly?" said Nikita in answer to the low whinny with which he was greeted by the goodtempered, mediumsized bay stallion, with a rather slanting crupper, who stood alone in the shed. 
Go and ask which sledge is to be harnessedthe wide one or the small onethere's a good fellow!" The cook's husband went into the house, which stood on an iron foundation and was ironroofed, and soon returned saying that the little one was to be harnessed. 
"Take me with you!" he cried, fastening up his coat as he ran. 
Vasili Andreevich did not answer. Her words evidently annoyed him and he frowned angrily and spat. 
Only a moment, Father, Vasili Andreevich!" replied Nikita, and running quickly with his inturned toes in his felt boots with their soles patched with felt, he hurried across the yard and into the workmen's hut. 
Nikita's wide coatcollar, as he sat on the windy side, pressed close to his cheek and nose. 
It goes without saying that he's a good horse," replied Nikita. 
But Vasili Andreevich wished to talk. 
Brekhunov isn't a man to wrong anyone. 
They drove on in silence for about half an hour. 
He huddled up and breathed into the collar which covered his mouth, and was not wholly cold. 
Vasili Andreevich, who was driving, inflated his cheeks, blowing the breath out through his moustache. 
Nikita went to what had appeared dark, but found that it was earth which the wind had blown from the bare fields of winter oats and had strewn over the snow, colouring it. 
What is it?" 
It's the Zakharov factory land." 
Why, this must be the Goryachkin forest!" said Vasili Andreevich, pointing to something dark that appeared amid the snow in front of them. 
We'll see what forest it is when we get there," said Nikita. 
They were back on a road. 
But even the stakes ahead of them were not easy to see, since the wind blew in their faces. 
One peasant was whacking the snowcovered croup of their little horse with a long switch, and the other two sitting in front waved their arms and shouted something. 
Well, if we've lost the road we must find it," said Nikita curtly, and getting out and stepping lightly on his pigeontoed feet he started once more going about on the snow. 
It was already growing dark. 
The snowstorm had not increased but had also not subsided. If we could only hear those peasants!" said Vasili Andreevich. 
Before another halfhour had passed they saw something dark ahead of thema wood or a villageand stakes again appeared to the right. 
And indeed, there on their left was that same barn with the snow flying from it, and farther on the same line with the frozen washing, shirts and trousers, which still fluttered desperately in the wind. 
Halfway through the village Vasili Andreevich turned the horse towards a large doublefronted brick house and stopped at the porch. 
We went a second time but lost our way again." 
Let's go in and warm ourselves, Nikita." Well, why not? 
The dog yelped desperately with fright and anger and then burst out barking like a puppy at the stranger. 
Get ready to receive him!" said the lad with a smile. 
They had six horses, three cows, two calves, and some twenty sheep. 
It was one of the few homesteads that remained still undivided, but even here the dull internal work of disintegration which would inevitably lead to separation had already begun, starting as usual among the women. 
Two sons were living in Moscow as watercarriers, and one was in the army. 
Nikita took off his coat, shook it again, hung it up beside the oven, and came up to the table. 
It's not good for him," said Vasili Andreevich, munching a cracknel after emptying his glass. 
At last, however, the old man could not restrain himself, and with tears in his eyes declared that he would not consent to a breakup of the family during his lifetime, that his house was prospering, thank God, but that if they separated they would all have to go begging. 
It's as if the devil possessed him." 
Now like savage beast 'twill howl, and now 'tis wailing like a child." Nikita nodded approvingly as he arranged the reins. 
The old man, seeing Vasili Andreevich off, brought a lantern into the passage to show him a light, but it was blown out at once. 
He knew the road and the whole district so well, and the lines about "snowy circles wheeling wild" described what was happening outside so aptly that it cheered him up. 
There now, we must be astray again," said Vasili Andreevich, pulling up. 
Well, if we are we can't help it," said Nikita. 
"Now we'll tie you up here and I'll put down some straw and take off your bridle. 
He smoothed the remaining straw over the bottom of the sledge, putting more if it under his side. 
It will snow us up so deep that we shan't be able to get out in the morning!" he thought, listening to a gust of wind that blew against the front of the sledge, bending it and lashing the snow against it. He raised himself and looked round. 
Yes, that God gives to those who take trouble, but not to loafers, lieabeds, or fools. 
Everything around him was just as before. 
But try as he would he could not get drowsy, on the contrary he felt wide awake and animated. Again he began counting his gains and the debts due to him, again he began bragging to himself and feeling pleased with himself and his position, but all this was continually disturbed by a stealthily approaching fear and by the unpleasant regret that he had not remained in Grishkino. 
How different it would be to be lying warm on a bench!" 
"Let's have a look at my watch. It will be cold to unbutton, but if I only know that it's getting near morning I shall at any rate feel more cheerful. 
He could not see anything without a light. 
It steadily strengthened, and having become quite clear diminished just as gradually. 
After this Vasili Andreevich could not fall asleep again or even calm himself. 
He tried to wrap himself up and lie down as before, but could no longer do so. 
"The horse will move when he has someone on his back. 
He won't grudge his life, but I have something to live for, thank God." 
VII From the time he had covered himself with the sackcloth and seated himself behind the sledge, Nikita had not stirred. 
The foot in the boot with a hole in it had already grown numb, and he could no longer feel his big toe. 
"It seems a pity to give up what one is used to and accustomed to. 
Sins?" he thought, and remembered his drunkenness, the money that had gone on drink, how he had offended his wife, his cursing, his neglect of church and of the fasts, and all the things the priest blamed him for at confession. 
Where am I to escape to?" So at first he thought of what might happen to him that night, and then did not return such thoughts but gave himself up to whatever recollections came into his head of themselves. 
"It would seem hard to leave a life such as his! 
Left alone, Nikita considered for a moment what he should do. 
VIII Meanwhile Vasili Andreevich, with his feet and the ends of the reins, urged the horse on in the direction in which for some reason he expected the forest and forester's hut to be. 
But its being the same wormwood was not all, for beside it there was a horse's track partly snowed over. 
Suddenly some terrible, deafening cry resounded near his ears, and everything shivered and shook under him. 
His legs and arms trembled and his breathing came fast. 
It was real snow that lashed his face and covered him and chilled his right hand from which he had lost the glove, and this was a real desert in which he was now left alone like that wormwood, awaiting an inevitable, speedy, and meaningless death. 
IX Having stumbled back to the sledge Vasili Andreevich caught hold of it and for a long time stood motionless, trying to calm himself and recover his breath. 
Forgive me for Christ's sake..." said Nikita in a tearful voice, continuing to wave his hand before his face as if driving away flies. 
Having done this he hurriedly undid his girdle, opened out his fur coat, and having pushed Nikita down, law down on top of him, covering him not only with his fur coat but with the whole of his body, which glowed with warmth. 
At first and for a long time Nikita lay motionless, then he sighed deeply and moved. 
He lay like that for a long time, wiping his eyes on the fur of his coat and tucking under his knew the right skirt, which the wind kept turning up. But he longed so passionately to tell somebody of his joyful condition that he said: "Nikita!" 
But he did not think of his legs or of his hands but only of how to warm the peasant who was lying under him. 
He no longer felt any kind of terror. 
He whom he was expecting came; not Ivan Matveich the policeofficer, but someone elseyet it was he whom he had been waiting for. He came and called him; and it was he who had called him and told him to lie down on Nikita. 
I'm coming!" he cried joyfully, and that cry awoke him, but woke him up not at all the same person he had been when he fell asleep. 
He must have frozen too," thought Nikita of Mukhorty, and indeed those hoof knocks against the sledge, which had awakened Nikita, were the last efforts the already numbed Mukhorty had made to keep on his feet before dying. 
O Lord God, it seems Thou are calling me too!" said Nikita. "Thy Holy Will be done. 
He died at home as he had wished, only this year, under the icons with a lighted taper in his hands. 
You never know what you're going to get. 
I bet if I think about it real hard, I could remember my first pair of shoes. 
That's in the county of Greenbow. 
I met the principal and all. 
I want to show you something, Mrs Gump. 
We're a progressive school system. 
It sounded good. 
I sure will, Mama. 
Nothing at all, thank you. 
Are you stupid or something? 
Sometimes, we'd just sit out and wait for the stars. 
Come on! 
Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far, far, far away from here. 
She was to live with her grandma, just over on Creekmore Avenue, which made me happy, because she was so close. 
Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends all the way up through high school. 
Run, you stupid son of a bitch! 
Two Negroes were admitted, but only after Governor George Wallace had carried out his symbolic threat to stand in the schoolhouse door. 
Earl, what's going on? 
Coons are trying to get into school. 
Governor Wallace did what he promised. 
But I'd go and visit her every chance I got. 
Billy, wait a second. 
It's OK. 
President Kennedy met with the collegiate AllAmerican football team at the Oval Office today. 
The really good thing about meeting the President of the United States is the food. 
How does it feel to be an AllAmerican? 
Have you given any thought to your future? 
It's not really hard. 
Jesus H. Christ. 
Let's give a big round of applause to the luscious Bobbie Dylon. 
I got something here for you. God damn it! 
Forrest, you stay away from me, OK? 
Except for all the beer cans and barbecues, it was. 
Look, it's pretty basic here. 
You stick with me and learn from the guys who've been in country a while, you'll be all right. 
Little Rock's a fine town. 
See the platoon sergeant. 
Two standing orders in this platoon. One, take good care of your feet. 
Cleveland, he was from Detroit. 
Shoot, it even rained at night. 
OK. 
We'll live right on the boat. 
Misfire! 
I know my position is danger close! 
If I'd have known this was going to be the last time me and Bubba was gonna talk, I'd of thought of something better to say. 
Gump, how can you watch that stupid shit? 
Come on. 
Even Lieutenant Dan would come and watch me play. 
Son, you been awarded the Medal of Honour. 
Where were you hit? 
After that, Mama went to the hotel to lay down, so I went out for a walk to see our capital. 
There was this man giving a little talk. 
And for some reason, he was wearing an American flag for a shirt. 
Let's get up there. 
The war in vietnam? 
The war in Vietfuckin'nam! 
You said it all. 
My name is Forrest. 
I should have known it was going to be some bullshit hassle! 
He should not be hitting you, Jenny. 
We walked around all night, Jenny and me, just talkin'. 
You know that. 
It's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. 
In the land of China, people hardly got nothin' at all. 
Now, if I accept Jesus into my heart, I'll get to walk beside him in the kingdom of heaven. 
Did you hear what I said? 
Well, kiss my crippled ass. 
Before you go, why don't you get your ass down to the corner and get us more ripple? 
I got to buy me one soon as I have some money. 
The day you are a shrimp boat captain, I will come and be your first mate. 
That's Times Square. 
Don't you just love New Year's? 
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! 
What are you, stupid or something? 
Don't you ever call him stupid! 
You retard! 
You might want to send a maintenance man to that office across the way. 
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. 
I remember everything you said, and I got it all figured out. 
So anyway, I'm putting all that on gas, ropes, and new nets and a brandnew shrimping boat. 
A couple more, you can have yourself a cocktail. 
I hoped whatever she was doing made her happy. 
I thought about Jenny all the time. 
You'll never sink this boat! 
You call this a storm? 
And as in other towns up and down the coast, Bayou La Batre's entire shrimping industry has fallen victim to Carmen and has been left in utter ruin. 
We got more money than Davy Crockett. 
I'll see you tomorrow. 
I bought her a new hat with little flowers on it. 
Now, because I had been a football star and war hero and national celebrity and a shrimping boat captain and a college graduate, the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama, decided to get together and offered me a fine job. 
So I never went back to work for Lieutenant Dan, though he did take care of my BubbaGump money. 
And because I was a goZillionaire and I liked doing it so much, I cut that grass for free. 
And then, she was there. 
It was wonderful having her home. 
I did all the talking. 
Sometimes I guess there Just aren't enough rocks. 
We was like peas and carrots again. 
When I got hungry, I ate. 
For the fourth time on his journey across America, Forrest Gump the gardener will cross the Mississippi River again today. 
I can't believe it's really you. 
"Here's somebody who has the answer." 
You just ran through a big pile of dog shit! 
Another time, I was running along, somebody who'd lost all his money in the tshirt business, he wanted to put my face on a tshirt, but he couldn't draw that well, and he didn't have a camera. 
Here, use this one. 
Some years later, I found out that that man did come up with an idea for a tshirt. 
And I think that's what my running was all about. 
I picked up the mail. 
Henry Street is just five or six blocks down that way. 
Do you, Forrest, take Jenny to be your wife? 
It was so clear, Jenny, it looked like there were two skies one on top of the other. 
Little Forrest is doing just fine. 
About to start school again soon, and I make his breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. 
And every night, we read a book. 
Here's your bus. 
I know this. 
They found me." "Eh? 
Well, when you get into the house, go straight through the vestibule and hall to the door at the end. 
He'll know what to do besides that. 
Pollyanna opened wide her eyes. "Why, of course I could! I'm HERE," she answered. "As if I'd be here if I hadn't got in! 
How do you know that?" asked the man, trying to change the position of his head without moving the rest of his body. 
She did not think he was. 
But I'm glad I was here." "So am I," nodded the doctor, as he turned his absorbed attention to the injured man. CHAPTER XIV. JUST A MATTER OF JELLY Pollyanna was a little late for supper on the night of the accident to John Pendleton; but, as it happened, she escaped without reproof. 
Oh, I DIDN'T drive her away?" "Not much you did," scoffed Nancy. 
Now I guess we're glad all right. 
"I can't help it, Nancy," she argued with a shake of her head. 
They aren't over in India; they're only out Westbut that's awful far away, just the same. 
Mrs. White has got the most money, but Mrs. Jones gives the mostwhich is kind of funny, isn't it?when you think of it. 
If you're EXtraordinary you can't be ORdinary, can you?" "You certainly can not." "Oh, that's all right, then. I'm glad I'm EXtraordinary," sighed Pollyanna, her face clearing. 
It was the very day you went that I found him in the woods, you know; and I had to unlock his house and telephone for the men and the doctor, and hold his head, and everything. 
But when Nancy made the jelly for Mrs. Snow this week I thought how nice it would be if I could take it to him instead of her, just this once. 
I'd be glad to send him jelly." Miss Polly began to shake her head again. 
Windows were open, an elderly woman was hanging out clothes in the back yard, and the doctor's gig stood under the portecochere. 
This time she rang the bellher fingers were not stiff today from a tight clutch on a bunch of keys. 
A familiarlooking small dog bounded up the steps to greet her, but there was a slight delay before the woman who had been hanging out the clothes opened the door. 
Then he added whimsically: "You don't know, of course; but that little girl is better than a sixquart bottle of tonic any day. If anything or anybody can take the grouch out of Pendleton this afternoon, she can. 
"Oh, I'm so glad they let me in! 
Pollyanna looked distressed. "Nno, sir: she didn't. 
"Well, Miss Pollyanna, may I have the pleasure of seeing you home?" asked the doctor smilingly. 
"After all, I'm afraid some of usdo have to, little girl," he said. 
Looking now into Pollyanna's shining eyes, he felt as if a loving hand had been suddenly laid on his head in blessing. He knew, too, that never again would a long day's work or a long night's weariness be quite without that newfound exaltation that had come to him through Pollyanna's eyes. 
"I've had a perfectly beautiful ride with the doctor," announced Pollyanna, bounding up the steps. 
It was Pollyanna's turn to frown. 
Miss Polly grew a sudden vivid pink. "You TOLD him I didn't!" Pollyanna opened wide her eyes at the remonstrative dismay in her aunt's voice. 
It's those that I'm talking aboutthose darling little black curls. 
Now wait just where you are. 
"Oh, my! what pretty hair you've got," prattled Pollyanna; "and there's so much more of it than Mrs. Snow has, too! 
Mrs. White's was pretty nice, though, and she looked just lovely one day when I dressed her up inOh, Aunt Polly, I've just happened to think of something! 
Now sit still. 
"Will you come down, please?" In the bedroom Pollyanna found a flushedfaced, angryeyed woman plucking at the pins that held a lace shawl in place. 
And Miss Polly pulled the locks so tightly back that the last curl lay stretched dead at the ends of her fingers. 
I'll tell her," nodded the little girl, contentedly. 
"Why, Dr. Chilton! 
"Still, I don't see why," maintained Pollyanna, "when she looked so pretty!" The doctor said nothing. 
I thank you for the jelly, too," he added in a lighter voice. "Did you like it?" asked Pollyanna with interest. "Very much. 
I thought, at first, after I found out who you were, the other day, that I didn't want you to come any more. 
They wouldn't, if they knew him. 
She wouldn't send the jelly to him, you know, and she was so afraid he'd think she did send it!" "Probably she didn't call him no duty," shrugged Nancy. 
Just think of havin' a book lived right under yer nose like this and me not knowin' it all this time! 
"But he didn't," cried Pollyanna, "not till _I_ talked to HIM, first. 
And he didn't even know who I was till I took the calf'sfoot jelly, and had to make him understand that Aunt Polly didn't send it, and" Nancy sprang to her feet and clasped her hands together suddenly. 
"It was after he found out you was Miss Polly's niece that he said he didn't ever want ter see you again, wa'n't it?" "Oh, yes. 
Nancy drew a long sigh. "Then I've got it, sure! 
"Why, Nancy, he couldn't be! She doesn't like him," objected Pollyanna. 
Pollyanna still looked incredulous, and with another long breath Nancy happily settled herself to tell the story. 
I couldn'ther and a lover! 
He talked to her, it was true, and he showed her many strange and beautiful thingsbooks, pictures, and curios. 
Aunt Polly, indeed, seemed particularly bitter against Dr. Chilton, as Pollyanna found out one day when a hard cold shut her up in the house. 
Pollyanna looked at her for a moment with mournfully interested eyes; then she sighed: "I just love to see you when your cheeks are pink like that, Aunt Polly; but I would so like to fix your hair. 
"Ohohoh, how pretty it is! 
If you really WANT to live in a rainbowI don't see but we'll have to have a rainbow for you to live in!" Pollyanna had not hung up three of the pendants in the sunlit window before she saw a little of what was going to happen. 
School, in some ways, was a surprise to Pollyanna; and Pollyanna, certainly, in many ways, was very much of a surprise to school. 
One Saturday afternoon he spoke to her about it. 
"See here, Pollyanna, how would you like to come and live with me?" he asked, a little impatiently. 
They were sitting in the great library today. 
"Oh, but you aren't really glad at all for things; you just SAY you are," pouted Pollyanna, her eyes on the dog, dozing before the fire. 
"You know you don't play the game right EVER, Mr. Pendleton, you know you don't!" 
Why, I'mAunt Polly's!" A quick something crossed the man's face that Pollyanna could not quite understand. 
And ever since then this great gray pile of stone has been a housenever a home. 
 WHICH IS MORE SURPRISING Sunday mornings Pollyanna usually attended church and Sunday school. 
"You seemed more upsetting than soothing yesterday, young lady." Pollyanna laughed. 
Pollyanna looked shocked. 
You're making other folks so glad giving them things that you just can't help being glad yourself! 
Why, look at those prisms you gave Mrs. Snow and me, and the gold piece you gave Nancy on her birthday, and" "Yes, yesnever mind about all that," interrupted the man. 
There was a moment's silence, then she added: "Well, anyhow, I'm glad I didn't tell her yesterday;because then I supposed SHE was wanted, too." 
She was very fond of John Pendleton, and she was very sorry for himbecause he seemed to be so sorry for himself. 
I never sent a penny to them in my life. 
I had to tell him last week that even my Ladies' Aid out West wouldn't take him, and he was so disappointed. 
"I certainly do mean just that." 
"I don't doubt it," rejoined the man; "butI think I prefer the lonesomeness." 
The Rev. Paul Ford turned a little wonderingly. "Was YOUR father a minister, Pollyanna?" 
There was a long pause. 
In the Rev. Paul Ford's study that evening the minister sat thinking. 
On and on read the ministera word here, a line there, a paragraph somewhere else: "What men and women need is encouragement. 
Thus it happened that the Rev. Paul Ford's sermon the next Sunday was a veritable buglecall to the best that was in every man and woman and child that heard it; and its text was one of Pollyanna's shining eight hundred: "Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, you righteous, and shout for joy all you that are upright in heart." 
The doctor got to his feet a little abruptly. 
"Couldn't you tell anythin' what it done to her?thatthat" Old Tom's face worked convulsively. 
Pollyanna's eyes grew a bit wild. "But I don't want to be taken care ofthat is, not for long! I want to get up. 
JOHN PENDLETON Pollyanna did not go to school "tomorrow," nor the "day after tomorrow." 
On the bed Pollyanna lay blinking at the dancing band of colors on the ceiling, which came from one of the prisms in the window. 
"You seem toto be glad for a good many things, my dear," faltered Aunt Polly, putting her hand to her throat as if her collar bound. 
Who do you s'pose is in the parlor now with the mistress? 
And the team he come in awaitin' this minute at the door for him, jest as if he wa'n't the cranky old crosspatch he is, what never talks ter no one! jest think, Mr. TomHIM acallin' on HER!" 
Miss Polly knew about it, of course, and was sorry for him. 
They said she was runnin' after him." 
She was so still I thought she hadn't heard; and I was jest goin' ter say it over when she speaks up quiet like: 'Tell Mr. Pendleton I will be down at once.' 
She did not offer her hand, however, and her face was coldly reserved. 
She talks like that all the time, until itit seems as if I shoulddie!" 
And believe me, he can NOT know so much aboutabout your trouble, as this great doctor does, who will come from New York tomorrow." 
Her cheeks were very red, too. 
At the last moment a telegram told of an unavoidable delay owing to the sudden illness of the specialist himself. 
But there's one, anyhow, that ain't answerin'," grinned Old Tom. 
"She told YOU, then, too, about that 'eregame?" "Oh, yes. 
We've been playin' itthat gamesince almost the first, because there wa'n't no one else she could play it withthough she did speak ofher aunt." 
"Yes, it wasall around, all around," sighed Nancy in her turn, as she went back to her kitchen. 
For no one were those days of waiting easy. 
Miss Polly said little; but even the softening waves of hair about her face, and the becoming laces at her throat, could not hide the fact that she was growing thin and pale. 
As to the gamePollyanna told Nancy these days how glad she was going to be when she could go to school again, go to see Mrs. Snow, go to call on Mr. Pendleton, and go to ride with Dr. Chilton nor did she seem to realize that all this "gladness" was in the future, not the present. 
And of course if you do, I can be glad for that. 
I begs yer pardon," apologized the girl, hurriedly. 
It was only that she was wantin' ter take him again, she said, so's ter show you he really was a lovely child's presence. 
On street corners and in store loungingplaces the men talked, too, and weptthough not so openly. 
"Oh, Isee," said Miss Polly very gently; and she did seemore than Pollyanna realized. 
Of course she's SEEN some things, because she's been there, and she's known mother is different; but I want her to know HOW different she isand me, too. 
She would have asked what Milly meant by this "game," but there was no opportunity. 
Miss Polly did not know her at all. 
It came in the shape of a call from a certain young woman with unnaturally pink cheeks and abnormally yellow hair; a young woman who wore high heels and cheap jewelry; a young woman whom Miss Polly knew very well by reputationbut whom she was angrily amazed to meet beneath the roof of the Harrington homestead. 
"Yes, I will tell her," promised Miss Polly, a little faintly. 
And she said you could do it, too, and that you didn't seem ter mind not havin' the doll so much, because you was so glad you DIDN'T need the crutches. 
"And you'd be surprised ter find how cute it works, ma'am, too," maintained Nancy, with almost the eagerness of Pollyanna herself. "I wish I could tell you what a lot she's done for mother and the folks out home. 
That's why I begun it, so she could have some one." 
John Pendleton had told her what a fine boy Jimmy was getting to be, and how well he was doing. 
John Pendleton was conscious that he must have started visiblyhe did know something of the affair between Polly Harrington and Thomas Chilton, but the matter had not been mentioned between them for fifteen years, or more. 
Pendleton, you know very well I haven't been inside that door for more than fifteen years. 
"But couldn't you gowithout a summons?" 
What's any lovers' quarrel after it's over?" he snarled, pacing the room angrily. 
Jimmy Bean, at his Saturday morning task of pulling up the first little green weeds of the flowerbeds, sat up with ears and eyes wide open. 
John Pendleton came erect in his chair. 
Jimmy sighed again. 
LISTENING?" " It wasn't about me, and it wasn't sneak listenin' ," bridled Jimmy. 
He was still more surprised to hear the lady say, a little breathlessly: "Dr. Warren, you asked me once to allow Dr. Chilton to be called in consultation, andI refused. 
Dr. Chilton held out both his hands to Pollyanna. 
This is because everyone who sees was born into a world full of colour. 
Colour has a crucial role in man's communication with the outside world, in the proper functioning of his memory, and in his brain's fulfilment of its learning functions. 
For humans, the external world only means something when it is seen as a whole with its colours. 
Identifying objects and our surroundings are not the only benefits from the diversity of colours. 
In order to see this harmony and derive pleasure from every detail of it, man has been equipped with a pair of eyes, which have a very special design. 
The only being on earth that can understand the existence of such an order in the universe is man because he has the power to reflect and reason. 
To whom belong the design of the diverse colours and the harmony between them? 
He would also fully acknowledge that such an environment furnished with the most appropriate conditions for the survival of humankind could not have come into existence by chance. 
Some details have an important place in the minds of humans and they never change. 
Every living being and every object held under light has a colour. 
For this, the rays must pass through a filter. 
5. The rays coming from the sun must pass through the lens and the layers of the eye and be converted into nerve impulses in the retina. 
Then these signals must be conveyed to the vision centre of the brain, which is responsible for making sense of sight. 
6. There is a last step that has to be fulfilled for us to "see" any colour. 
The Role of Retina in Seeing 
Allah possesses eternal power and wisdom that cover the whole universe. 
When He decides on something, He just says to it, ‘Be!' and it is. 
Surely, that these rays, which are the key to life on earth, serve such important purposes and, at the same time, have all the necessary characteristics for this, cannot be attributed to coincidence. 
Similarly, both light and heat are emitted by the sun, which is a star, as energy in the form of waves. 
Examining another element of this flawless system, we once again see the impossibility of its coming into existence as a consequence of coincidence. 
Certainly, in such a situation, several alternative solutions will surface. 
By means of specific layers of the atmosphere, sunrays reach earth only in required amounts because the atmosphere processes the sunrays specifically according to their wavelengths. 
It is necessary for them to possess properties enabling them to pass through the atmosphere and reach the earth. 
There is another important point that needs mention. 
Out of a spectrum whose width is hinted at by this figure of 1025, the sun emits only those rays that are useful to us and necessary for a colourful world, and the atmosphere mainly allows harmless and indeed useful rays to reach the earth. 
How, then, is this uninterrupted image made? 
The eye, with its tissues and organelles such as lachrymal glands, cornea, conjunctiva, iris and pupil, lens, retina, choroid, eye muscles and lids, is a matchless system. 
After a short introduction to the eye, let us also look at how the event of seeing takes place. 
The explanations of the subject are largely based on theories. 
However, the brain has been fulfilling all its functions perfectly since the moment man came into existence, just as it does today. 
The green colour of plants, the colour of skin, the colours of animals, in short all colours stem from the structural characteristics of the pigments contained in those objects or living things. 
The question is: how do these special molecules develop in the skins of living beings? 
Certainly the possibility of the occurrence of such a coincidence is zero. 
These pigments absorb certain wavelengths coming from the sun and reflect light having the wavelength that corresponds to green colour. 
The carotenoids are not only useful as warning coloration; in some insects they are themselves transformed into poisonous compounds, in which case they serve a twofold purpose of being both a weapon and a signal.15 By means of this very special system that Allah has created, many living beings continue to thrive. 
Thus far, we have briefly examined only a few types of pigment existing in nature. 
Different colours bear different meanings for every living being. 
An insect having the same colour as a flower, a snake standing still as a tree's branch, a frog adapting to the colour of wet ground, in short, all selfcamouflaging creatures are evidence proving that camouflage is a specially created defence tactic. 
It is totally inconsistent and meaningless to claim that such an exceptional ability has come into being by chance. 
Everything in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah. 
For example, in summer, the fur of the northern fox turns white, because their body temperature is high. 
While some birds become completely white in winter months, they take on a new appearance in spring matching the colour of the ground and vegetation. 
Rich colour diversity in birds is basically due to the presence of pigments in the feathers, which were stored during the initial development phases of the feather, or the light shifts which occur depending on the structural characteristics of the feathers. 
The feathers absorbing the full spectrum of light and only reflecting blue, on the other hand, creates the blue colour of some birds.40 
In addition, pigments, which give colour to feathers, enhance the strength of the feathers, store energy coming from the sun and prevent harmful ultraviolet rays from entering the body. 
Butterflies' camouflaging skills are as impressive as their false eyes. 
It is by no means possible for a butterfly alone to perform these acts. 
Then consider trying to achieve the quality of colours such as those of the butterflies, which, by developing the same colours and patterns as the environment, become almost invisible. You would not be able to develop even a single meaningful colour. 
The situation being so, it would be certainly an unscientific and irrational approach to claim that this glorious system in butterflies has come into existence by chance free of conscious design. 
All the features of seadwelling creatures are organised in such a way as to enable them to live in water in the easiest way possible. 
Each plant you see around you or know from books has colours and patterns that are exclusive to its kind. 
The reproductive process of each is different, the proportions of nectar they contain and their fragrances are all different. 
One of the most important properties of the colours in sunlight is that their energy levels are different from one another. 
The basic pigment molecule in green plants is the substance "chlorophyll" as earlier stated. 
For example, in addition to chlorophyll, there are also carotenoid pigments in plants. 
The owner of this matchless artistry that prevails all over the world is Allah, Who has infinite wisdom. 
Allah has power over all things. 
Allah's artistry in creation is matchless. 
Allah creates everything He creates in the most perfect forms. 
When we look at nature, we see that every plant and every animal have their own particular colours and patterns exclusive to their kind. 
The theory of evolution, which claims that everything has come into being by random coincidence, has reached a total impasse because of the artistry, diversity of colours and harmony exhibited in nature. 
It is definitely not possible for colours, patterns and the symmetry in the patterns of living beings to have been created through such a mechanism. 
Suppose a scientist to take a single cell of a bacterium for instance, provide the most suitable laboratory conditions, use all the equipment required, spend effort on having this cell evolve over millions of years (though this is not possible, let us suppose it is); what would he acquire in the end? 
This would finally cause a chameleon devoid of any other defence mechanism to die or starve and, after a while, to become extinct. 
Therefore there is no reasonable or scientific ground for claiming that a system such as the universe has come into existence by chance. 
Butterfly wings are another example of the symmetry in nature. 
A pattern on one wing is also present on the other in exactly the same place. 
For each interdependently working piece forming this order has an extremely important role in the overall process. 
Any scientist would tell you the way this system works and that the world we think we live in is in reality an aggregate of perceptions. 
He goes on to say that our brain perceives the stimuli that are filtered through our senses, and that the tree is only a stimulus. 
The inside of the skull is pitchdark and completely insulated from any light and odour. 
What makes you feel the light in pitchdarkness? What makes you feel the odour in a place completely insulated from every kind of odour? Alternatively, what makes you feel other feelings? 
It is again our brain that transforms these signals into colours. 
Neither is the apple red nor is the sky blue nor the trees green. 
In my dreams, I see that I do various things, I go various places; when I wake up, however, I see that I have not done anything, gone anywhere, and that I peacefully lie in my bed. 
What little thanks you show! 
All the images shown man are creations of Allah. 
Allah relates in the Qur'an that He is everywhere and that He encompasses all things: 
His Footstool encompasses the heavens and the earth and their preservation does not tire Him.

He was a skinny, blackhaired, bespectacled boy who had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time. 
The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o'clock news reached Harry's ears and his stomach turned over. 
Every day this summer had been the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again… and always, growing more insistent all the time, the question of why nothing had happened yet. 
He had moved about two inches when several things happened in very quick succession. 
Eyes streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street to spot the source of the noise, but he had barely staggered upright when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat. 
Harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans and tried to look innocent. 
'Listening to the news,' said Harry in a resigned voice. 
Could he be sure it hadn't been the sound of something breaking inside a neighbour's house? 
Harry merely glanced at the front page before throwing it aside these days; when the idiots who ran the paper finally realised that Voldemort was back it would be headline news, and that was the only kind Harry cared about. 
Had they all forgotten what he had done? 
Admittedly, his letters were just as empty of proper news as Ron and Hermione's, but at least they contained words of caution and consolation instead of tantalising hints: I know this must be frustrating for you… Keep your nose clean and everything will be OK… Be careful and don't do anything rash… Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road and headed towards the darkening play park, he had (by and .large) done as Sirius advised. 
The park was as empty as the surrounding streets. 
How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so easily? 
Let them try… he'd love to vent some of his frustration on the boys who had once made his life hell. 
But they didn't turn around, they didn't see him, they were almost at the railings. 
Harry mastered the impulse to call after them… seeking a fight was not a smart move… he must not use magic… he would be risking expulsion again. 
Harry preferred Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches of jewelbright colour in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing disapproving mutters about his 'delinquent' appearance when he passed the householders. 
Did he say you look like a pig that's been taught to walk on its hind legs? 
They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had first seen Sirius and which formed a short cut between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. 
Harry grinned again. 
You know that boxing title you keep banging on about? 
'What am I supposed to be frightened of, pillows or something?' 
''Come and help me, Dad! 
Dudley's terrified voice broke in Harry's ear. 
I'll hhit you, I swear I will!' 
He heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the alley fence, stumbling. 
There was a horrible squealing yell and Dudley's footsteps stopped. 
There was more than one. 
'Get your fat bottom off the ground, quick!' 
How am I going to tell Dumbledore what's happened? 
'Andithadbetterbeyouandyoucantellhimwhyyouweren'ttheretohelp!' 
'Now come on, Harry, what are you waiting for?' 
Harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out that he could barely walk under Dudley's bulk. 
I want to knowBut Mrs Figg had already set off at a trot, carpet slippers flopping, string bag clanking. 
Aunt Petunia was ushering Dudley into a chair; he was still very green and clammylooking. 
He was expelled from Hogwarts. 
He was never going back. Uncle Vernon was purplefaced, shouting, his fists still raised; Aunt Petunia had her arms around Dudley, who was retching again. 
The madhouse has chucked me out,' said Harry. 
'Right,' Harry said, 'I've changed my mind, I'm staying.' 
'Who are all these ruddy owls from?' he growled. 
The first one was from the Ministry of Magic, expelling me,' said Harry calmly. 
He was straining his ears to catch any noises outside, in case the Ministry representatives were approaching, and it was easier and quieter to answer Uncle Vernon's questions than to have him start raging and bellowing. 
'That wasn't me' 'Was,' muttered Dudley unexpectedly, and Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia instantly made flapping gestures at Harry to quieten him while they both bent low over Dudley. 
'All went dark,' Dudley said hoarsely, shuddering. 
He shuddered again and shook his large blond head, and despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on Harry since the arrival of the first owl, he felt a certain curiosity. 
'OK,' said Uncle Vernon, in a voice of forced calm, while Aunt Petunia laid an anxious hand on Dudley's forehead to feel his temperature. 
'It wasn't me! 
It was a couple of Dementors!' 
Harry was stunned. 
Have they sentenced you to anything? 
'And they'll sentence you there?' 
'What now?' said Harry impatiently. 
'Dudley and 1 were in the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk,' said Harry, speaking fast, fighting to control his temper. 
Then two Dementors turned up —' 'But what ARE Dementoids?' asked Uncle Vernon furiously. 
'You can't give a Dementor the old onetwo,' said Harry through clenched teeth. 
I want the truth about what happened tonight!' barked Uncle Yirnon. 
He wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen, and away from the Dursleys. 
How could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway where Harry was? 
'The boythe boy will have to stay, Vernon,' she said weakly. 
We'll have to keep him.' 
'Who was that Howler from?' 
His owl, Hedwig, was off hunting; her cage stood empty on the desk. 
And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him, stifling all further thought. 
'You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away.' 
'I am going to lock your door.' 
There was silence for a few seconds, then voices. 
Burglars, he thought, sliding off the bed on to his feetbut a split second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices down, and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly not troubling to do so. 
Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at Harry, who tried to smile back despite his state of shock. 
'Oooh, he looks just like I thought he would,' said the witch who was holding her lit wand aloft. 
'Harry, what form does your Patronus take?' Lupin asked. 
'How are you?' he asked, looking closely at Harry. 
Four weeks with nothing, not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from Privet Drive, and suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing matteroffactly in the house as though this was a longstanding arrangement. 
'I'myou're really lucky the Dursleys are out…' he mumbled. 
The Burrow?' Harry asked hopefully. 
'Dedalus Diggle' 'We've met before,' squeaked the excitable Diggle, dropping his violetcoloured top hat. 
He also wondered why so many of them were there. 
'We're just waiting for the signal to tell us it's safe to set off,' said Lupin, glancing out of the kitchen window. 
'Very clean, aren't they, these Muggles?' said the witch called Tonks, who was looking around the kitchen with great interest. 
'Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry,' requested Moody. 
He dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and down; the eye whizzed around, staring at them all in turn. 
'How're we gettingwherever we're going?' Harry asked. 
'Funny place,' she said. 
'It's a bit too clean, do you know what 1 mean? 
'My mums got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatlyshe even gets the socks to fold themselvesbut I've never mastered how she does itit's a kind of flick' She flicked her wand hopefully. 
'And I'm still riding a Comet Two Sixty' said Tonks enviously. 
Harry's trunk rose a few inches into the air. 
Holding her wand like a conductor's baton, Tonks made the trunk hover across the room and out of the door ahead of them, Hedwig's cage in her left hand. 
'Come here, boy,' said Moody gruffly, beckoning Harry towards him with his wand. 
If one of us is killed'Is that likely?' 
'I'm just telling the boy the plan,' growled Moody. 
Harry kicked off hard from the ground. 
He had not felt this alive in a month, or this happy. 
Harry lost track of time. 
He wondered how long they had been flying, it felt like an hour at least. 
Shivering, Harry looked around. 
'Wait till we're inside!' 
It was as though an extra house had inflated, pushing those on either side out of its way. 
The stereo in number eleven thudded on. 
'Get in quick, Harry,' Lupin whispered, 'but don't go far inside and don't touch anything.' 
He looked over his shoulder and saw the others filing in behind him, Lupin and Tonks carrying 
Ron and Hermione are upstairs, you can wait with them until the meetings over, then we'll have dinner. 
'Why?' 
'Well, I'm glad he left,' Harry said coldly. 
'If he hadn't, I wouldn't have done magic and Dumbledore would probably have left me at Privet Drive all summer.' 
'So why's Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark?' Harry asked, still trying hard to keep his voice casual. 
'You're not telling me he doesn't know ways to send messages without owls.' 
AND I'VE HANDLED MORE THAN YOU TWO'VE EVER MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE KNOWS ITWHO SAVED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE? 
'Is anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the Phoenix?' 
'Who's in it?' said Harry, coming to a halt with his hands in his pockets. 
'So we don't know the detailsbut we've got a general idea,' she added hastily, seeing the look on Harry's face. 
'So, what have you two been doing, if you're not allowed in meetings?' he demanded. 
'We've been decontaminating this house, it's been empty for ages and stuff's been breeding in here. 
We've managed to clean out the kitchen, most of the bedrooms and I think we're doing the drawing room tomo— AARGH!' 
Hermione said weakly to the twins, who were as vividly redhaired as Ron, though stockier and slightly shorter. 
'With distinction,' said Fred, who was holding what looked like a piece of very long, fleshcoloured string. 
'Bill doesn't like him, either,' said Ginny, as though that settled the matter. 
He sank on to the bed opposite the others. 
It's normally Mum who shouts.' 
'Yeah, we were all surprised,' said George, 'because Percy got into a load of trouble about Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything. 
They said Percy ought to have realised Crouch was off his rocker and informed a superior. 
'He came home really pleased with himselfeven more pleased than usual, if you can imagine that — and told Dad he'd been offered a position in Fudge's own office. 
'Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,' said Ron, shooting Harry a furtive look. 
'Yeah, I have!' said Harry. 
They're just building on Rita's stuff.' 
'But she laid the foundation for what they're trying to do now.' 
They keep slipping in snide comments about you. 
'Someone's told them to keep that quiet. 
We thought they would, it would tie in so well with this image of you as some stupid showoff. 
Seconds later, Mrs Weasley appeared in the bedroom doorway. 
'His life's ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a plaque just like his mother,' said Ron irritably. 
And it's not just me, Dumbledore says we should be kind to Kreacher too.' 
The old woman was drooling, her eyes were rolling, the yellowing skin of her face stretched taut as she screamed; and all along the hall behind them, the other portraits awoke and began to yell, too, so that Harry actually screwed up his eyes at the noise and clapped his hands over his ears. 
He followed his godfather to the bottom of the steps and through a door leading into the basement kitchen. 
Mr Weasley said, hurrying forward to greet him, and shaking his hand vigorously. 
'Sit down, Harry,' said Sirius. 
'You've met Mundungus, haven't you?' 
Mundungus fumbled nervously in his pockets, still staring at Harry, and pulled out a grimy 
'Erno, it's all right, Tonks, you have a rest too, you've done enough today.' 
Harry was left at the table with Sirius and Mundungus, who was still blinking at him mournfully. 
'Don't know what you're complaining about, myself.' 
'What?' said Harry incredulously. 
'Because the Ministry of Magic's still after me, and Voldemort will know all about me being an Animagus by now, Wormtail will have told him, so my big disguise is useless. 
'FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!' screamed Mrs Weasley. 
'Whatever you like,' said Sirius indifferently. 
Apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment, because Hermione and Ginny were soon requesting their favourite noses. 
They're not giving anything away yet,' said Bill. 
Course, they might prefer not to take sides at all. 
'He's feeling pretty antiwizard at the moment,' said Bill, 'he hasn't stopped raging about the Bagman business, he reckons the Ministry did a coverup, those goblins never got their gold from him, you know' 
'I don't know where you learned about right and wrong, Mundungus, but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons,' said Mrs Weasley coldly. 
She hasn't forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you.' 
I thought the first thing you'd do when you got here would be to start asking questions about Voldemort.' 
'Harry's not even of age!' 
'It's not my fault you haven't been told what the Order's doing,' said Sirius calmly, 'that's your parents' decision. 
'Where's Voldemort?' he said, ignoring the renewed shudders and winces at the name. 
His comeback didn't come off quite the way he wanted it to, you see. 
'How?' Harry asked, perplexed. 
'Dumbledore's got a shrewd idea,' said Lupin, 'and Dumbledore's shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.' 
'Because of the Ministry's attitude,' said Tonks. 
'But it seems he's become fond of power, and much more confident. 
What's more, the Ministry's leaning heavily on the Daily Prophet not to report any of what they're calling Dumbledore's rumourmongering, so most of the wizarding community are completely unaware any things happened, and that makes them easy targets for the Death Eaters if they're using the Imperius Curse.' 
They reported that he'd been voted out of the Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards because he's getting old and losing his grip, but it's not true; he was voted out by Ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing Voldemorts return. 
'But if Voldemort's trying to recruit more Death Eaters it's bound to get out that he's come back, isn't it?' asked Harry desperately. 
He's got other plans too, plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed, and he's concentrating on those for the moment.' 
'Like what kind of weapon?' said Harry. 
Mrs Weasley spoke from the shadows beside the door. 
Her arms were crossed and she looked furious. 
Til join, I want to join, I want to fight.' 
There are dangers involved of which you 
'Off to bed with you.' 
Mrs Weasley closed the door behind Harry with a sharp snap. 
Harry put on his pyjamas, took off his glasses and climbed into his chilly bed while Ron threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify Hedwig and Pigwidgeon, who were clattering around and rustling their wings restlessly. 
'First night I was here he came wandering in at three in the morning. 
Harry didn't need to ask what Ron meant. 
'Could be anything,' said Fred. 
'Maybe it's something that can kill loads of people at once,' suggested George. 
'He's got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain,' said Harry, 'he doesn't need anything more efficient than that.' 
'What do you mean?' said Harry. 
The floorboard creaked again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on Fred and George. 
It was around these that Mrs Weasley, Hermione, Ginny, Fred and George were grouped, all looking rather peculiar as they had each tied a cloth over their nose and mouth. 
'Cover your faces and take a spray,' Mrs Weasley said to Harry and Ron the moment she saw them, pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing on a spindlelegged table. 
They heard him thundering down the stairs as Mrs Black's screeches echoed up through the house once more: 'Stains, of dishonour, filthy halfbreeds, blood traitors, children of filth 'Close the door, please, Harry,' said Mrs Weasley. 
'Fred, what are you doing?' said Mrs Weasley sharply. 
Fred and I have been developing them this summer. 
If you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you throw up. 
The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the rest. 
'Kreacher said nothing,' said the elf, with a second bow to George, adding in a clear undertone, 'and there's its twin, unnatural little beasts they are.' 
Sirius had come back; he was glowering at the elf from the doorway. 
'Kreacher lives to serve the Noble House of Black' 
You suggest to him that he leaves this house, see how he takes it.' 
'My sweet old mother blasted me off after I ran away from homeKreacher's quite fond of muttering the story under his breath.' 
'When I was about sixteen,' said Sirius. 
Yeah, I camped out at your dad's in the school holidays, and when I was seventeen I got a place of my own. 
'No, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had the right idea, they were all for the purification of the wizarding race, getting rid of Muggleborns and having purebloods in charge. 
Harry, however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the right of Andromeda's burn mark. 
'You never said she was your' 'Does it matter if she's my cousin?' snapped Sirius. 'As far as I'm concerned, they're not my family. 
'My father put every security measure known to wizardkind on it when he lived here. 
It's unplottable, so Muggles could never come and callas if they'd ever have wanted toand now Dumbledore's added his protection, you'd be hard put to find a safer house anywhere. 
'They must be bad if you prefer this place,' said Sirius gloomily. 
Weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days. 
Despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly, still having dreams about corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle, Harry was managing to have fun for the first time all summer. 
He was determined on that. 
He would come back here to Grimmauld Place and live with Sirius. 
Sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork. 
Harry awoke at half past five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear. 
Harry scrambled into them. 
She's Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and the one who'll be questioning you.' 
'Mr Weasley, I think this might be out of order, too,' Harry said. 
Please state your name and business.' 
They were sinking slowly into the ground. 
If I'm not expelled from Hogwarts, I'll put in ten Galleons, Harry found himself thinking desperately. 
'We're not sure,' said the wizard seriously. 
The grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly, chains rattling, while the same cool female voice Harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again. 
Harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head; they were a pale violet colour and he could see Ministry of Magic stamped along the edge of their wings. 
The remaining memos continued to soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upwards again, then the doors opened and the voice made its announcement. 
This is us, Harry,' said Mr Weasley, and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors. 
'Yes, we are,' said Mr Weasley. 
Those are enchanted windows. 
They were talking as though they hardly knew each other and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr Weasley stood on his foot. 
He dropped his voice and said, 'If you can get away before seven, Molly's making meatballs.' 
'Third regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal Green, kindly investigate immediately." 
'We had two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. 
'Morning, Arthur,' he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to descend. 
'Urgent business, Bode,' said Mr Weasley, who was bouncing on the balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at Harry. 
A cold male voice rang across the courtroom. 
'An owl was sent to you this morning. 
A broad, squarejawed witch with very short grey hair sat on Fudge's left; she wore a monocle and looked forbidding. 
'Yes, sir,' said an eager voice Harry knew. 
His long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry and looked up at Fudge through the halfmoon spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked nose. 
'Ah,' said Fudge, who looked thoroughly disconcerted. 
Dumbledore sat down, put the tips of his long fingers together and surveyed Fudge over them with an expression of polite interest. 
'You received an official warning from the Ministry for using illegal magic three years ago, did you not?' 
'Oh, very well, very well,' snapped Fudge. 
'I'm a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter lives,' said Mrs Figg. 
'So you wouldn't have me registered, would you?' 
'Dementors don't run, they glide.' 
'The Dementors… describe them.' 
And I felt… as though all happiness had gone from the world… and I remembered… dreadful things…' Her voice shook and died. 
They went for the boys,' said Mrs Figg, her voice stronger and more confident now, the pink flush ebbing away from her face. 
Harry heard it thud shut behind her. 
He thought she looked just like a large, pale toad. She was rather squat with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon and a very wide, slack mouth. 
The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, highpitched voice that took Harry aback; he had been expecting a croak. 
'So silly of me. But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy!' 
'Then undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two Dementors were so very far from Azkaban and why they attacked without authorisation.' 
'I would remind everybody that the behaviour of these Dementors, if indeed they are not figments of this boy's imagination, is not the subject of this hearing!' said Fudge. 
'Serious miscarriage, my hat!' said Fudge at the top of his voice. 
'But, as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts students for misdemeanours at school, Harry's behaviour there is not relevant to this hearing,' said Dumbledore, as politely as ever, but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his words. 
You think so?' 
He was not at all sure that he had made a good impression. 
'Excellent,' said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his feet, pulling out his wand and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish. 
'You were tried by the full court?' 
'I think so,' said Harry quietly. 
Last of all to pass was Percy. 
Mugglebaiting might strike some wizards as funny, but it's an expression of something much deeper and nastier, and I for one' Mr Weasley broke off in midsentence. 
It was also obvious that the Kadima (Forward) Party, Labor Party and Likud (Consolidation) Party would win most of the seats in the Knesset.

It was Iranian President Ahmadinejad who came to the rescue of AIPAC. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel lent support in her first visit to Washington for the referral of Iran to the UN Security Council. 
Among these circles, Ahmadinejad is said to be informally called “young Stalin.” 
When were the Limits Exceeded? 
If the aim is a "functioning" democracy, in other words, putting social demands and choices into practice and realizing these within public practice, it can be said that both the General Staff and Justice Ministry far exceeded their purpose of formation. 
The state policy that turns the demands of the Kurds into an opposition obliged to produce violence, is a big example of strategic failure... 
It is cautionary that the ministries of Justice and Interior are playing the roles of facilitators reinforcing the deep state mechanism with all these developments. 
But this time, anxieties are not at crisis level. 
Italian observers predict probable names will include Massimo D’Alema, the PM who hosted Kurdish Worker’s Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan in Rome, and European Parliament (EP) member Emma Bonino, who is known for her healthy support for Turkey’s membership. 
Iran maintains its activities are aimed at peaceful energy production. 
The European Union (EU) also admitted that the concept of “Islamic terrorism” is misused by racist groups in Europe and terror networks such as alQaeda. 
As a result of long consultations with academic experts, the EU will review expressions such as “Islamic terrorism,” “Islamist terrorism,” “fundamentalist,” and “jihadi.” 
The new concurrence is intended to ease European Muslim involvement in the struggle. 
Europeans have to formulate a particular method, dissimilar to that of the United States, for dealing with religionbased terrorism, said Rik Coolsaet, a professor of political sciences at Gent, and head officer of the Royal Institute of Belgium. 
Islam, on the other hand, is a religion like any other religion, and cannot by any means be associated with fascism. 
Zia will hold talks on political and economic cooperation and sign various deals between the two countries at the meetings accompanied by Bangladesh Foreign Minister M. Morshed Khan and a group of businessmen. 
Muslims in Bangladesh, known as East Pakistan before, gave great support to the Turkish Independence War. 
Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, who mentioned the issue in a party group meeting, defined the two drafts relating to social security as, “One of the biggest reform packages of the history of the Republic.” 
You need the heart and the courage to take these risks. 
The “health booklet,” to keep records of disease history of the individual, will disappear from the circulation. Social security numbers will be enough for examination and retirement services. 
Infants will be covered by general health insurance as soon as the mother is pregnant. 
In this way the basic needs to sustain extended lunar explorations, such as frozen water, oxygen, hydrogen and several types of mines will be investigated.

Burned tires, stone throwing children, redyellowgreen flags and highly politicized people… A cosmopolitan city of civilization, where Turks, Armenians, Kurds, Syrians, Keldanis, Jews and even Greeks could live altogether in the beginning of the 20th century, Diyarbakir has now turned into a weird city which cannot tolerate the existence of anything different from itself. 
The old Diyarbakir ought to rid itself of politicization in a bid to help the old orient emerge. 
The excellent and aweinspiring sunrise over the Suphan Mountain and centuries of friendship in Adilcevaz will all be open to observation. The whole region is covered in the dust of the ashes left over from the fire caused by terrorism here. 
It is again necessary to refresh our memories. 
In short, any terrorist activity carried out by the PKK and its sympathizers is neither in the Kurds’ interests nor that of democracy. 
He tends to view anyone who does not resemble him, dress like him, live like him and behave like him as a threat.

The ESI aims to make debates on Turkey more effective on the EU’s future factbased objectives. 
Such cooperation, on its part, requires Turkish participation.

What difference will we have if we respond to those attacking in swords with swords? 
They are not our teachers," he says. 
Plans to Confine Islam to Middle East 
I do not know what the equivalent of this insolence is, particularly insulting the Sacred in the reference world of the editors of the newspaper which published the cartoons, however, Islam prohibits affronting and cursing venerable values. 
This subject is evidently prohibited in the Surah AlAn'am (Cattle)verse 108 of the Quran. 
Also, the Danish government and the press were urged to show more sensitivity to Muslims. 
While Norwegian officials apologized for the publication of those cartoons, the Danish government refused to apologize, citing the freedom of thought.

We would make a circle in the air around Rumelihisari, pass by the fishermen’s boats, relax a bit at the top of a mosque as a special azan is being called for the dead and listen to religious officials calling azans. 
You can’t embrace the whole of it, however, if it so wishes, it embraces you. 
Every piece did not guarantee inclusion in the contest because these works had to go through a preliminary elimination stage by a smaller jury consisting of respected names in the sector in order to be eligible for competition before the bigger jury. 
That is, these works had to clear the hurdles before them. 
The works of the award winners have a chance becoming famous. EPICA described its objective as “to provide an opportunity for all good advertisement agencies by giving them awards.” 
Big advertisers want to work with agencies which have won awards at international competitions and invite such agencies to their respective contests.

And then I cursed the proTashnaks, the Unionists, the servants of the Tsars, and I also cursed the Protestant missionaries the most, because they all instigated one community against the other, whereas both communities had actually lived without troubling each other for over 1,000 years. 
Although Haykanor did not accept the proposal of her siblings to spend the rest of her life in the US, she managed to keep track of her siblings. 
He thought he could achieve this target with the words he would say about the two issues that he perhaps never even came face to face with and never internalized before; the Kurdish and Armenian issues. 
The court that he will actually be responsible to is the public conscience. 
In the past, Africa was only a tool to enrich the European economy through the use of its mines; however, its sporting achievements nowadays raise the flags of European nations high in the sky. 
He was even considered to be one of the top ten players of the century; however, following him, African players were not as popularly selected for football teams up until the 1980s and 1990s. 
A woman needs to look 17 years old in order to be considered beautiful.

There was a problem in the air; however, the solution of this problem was nonesense. 
It is totally symbolic. Milosevich was tried but all Serbia was exonerated. 
The Republic of Turkey should have solved this matter then by questioning Talat Pasha and the supporters of the Tashnaks. 
Turks and Armenians who lived together for a millenium left deep wounds on each other. They fail to heal even though they want to. 
The Western media often emphasizes certain issues when writing about or monitoring Muslims. 
France, which carries the Armenian issue to the agenda the most and which wants to blacken Turks and Muslims in this way, never carries the massacres it committed in Algeria to the agenda. 
Uncle Kevork was the only grocer selling alcoholic beverages in our neighborhood.

Is there any place, anywhere where members of two different religions feed from the same culture, eat the same foods and sing the same songs? I don't know. 
We miss the humanitarian dimension of the Armenian issue. 
At least the Turks also suffered as much as the Armenians did. 
2.5 million Muslims who came together in Mecca from all over the world have returned to their homes. 
The Turkish Muslims' concept of world and civilization is much different to that of Afghan or African Muslims. 
To the universal call of Prophet Mohammed (pbuh), people are coming from Istanbul, from the mountains of Afghanistan, from northern Iraq, from Africa in their hundreds of thousands… From Europe, from Far East in short from every corner of the world, Mecca is flocked with people. 
Differences are dissolved in front of this blackcovered building. 
What kind of an influential power is this and what kind of a call this is? 
Was not it impossible for the West to carry out such diary studies? 
The religious segment, accused of reactionaryism and also of allegedly dragging Turkey backwards have provided the biggest support for the EU.process. 
Displaying incredible performance, a party like the Development and Justice Party (AKP), which has a religious base, took more initiative for democracy, and also took more risks. 
Religious people demonstrated that they expect to practice their religion freely by backing EU accession. 
The accusers, who pointed at others as impostors, have themselves clearly become imposters during the EU process. 
The control of power leads to processes for or against democratization, which relies on the regular transfer of power to a popularly chosen candidate. 
Unfortunately, we are learning from the West something we have failed to implement ourselves.

Where do Universities Stand in the EU? 
Very important steps have been taken on modernization in several important state establishments. Both military and civilian establishments are handling their responsibilities very well. 
In particular, the Council of Higher Education (YOK), established just after the September 12, 1980 military coup, has been harshly criticized in many aspects, such as its hegemony over sciences, universities and for not developing the freedom of thought. 
Moreover, in the last 35 years, YOK has imposed such strictures and constraints on universities, that would make one wish the Ihsan Dogramaci era after the military coup, had not ended.

The only person who was speaking on the issue was Deutsche Bahn (German Railways) Director Hartmut Mehdorn. 
The death toll that was originally announced as 40, was raised to 70, then to 128 and then to 139. Closely following the developments from various aspects in our newsroom, we expected that this number would rise further. 
Of course, they did not think he was doing the right thing, they simply could not understand such a tragicomic situation, because there is hardly any place in the world where such a secularism concept exists or is being implemented. 
We always considered this war as "data," just like a disagreement the surfaced on its own. 
Such a comprehensive and destructive war has no precedence in history. 
This is called intellectual bankruptcy, the idea that isolates European Jews from society and considers Gypsies and other colored races as "noncivilized and unnecessary," with their gilded signs, and the idea that bombed the world's most prosperous capitals and leveled them to the ground, making no distinction between civilians and soldiers, had in fact originated from the same source. 
The whopper, "this war was started by fascists but democrats won it," serves no purpose other than to conceal the humanitarian tragedy caused by World War II. Fascism did not originate from central Africa; chemical, biological and nuclear weapons were not invented on the Asian steppes; and today it is not the Oceanian natives who are designing computer games thrusted into the hands of kids as toys, that present the Japanese and the Nazis as black flies which should be swatted. 
Did the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki produce any benevolent result other than the "balance of terror" doctrine that prevented a new nuclear tussle during the Cold War years? 
Ask the man in the street the meaning of World War II, and the only image on his mind would be nothing but the thousands of stereotyped heroic movies produced by American cinema industry; the Americans and the British are always the good and the Japanese and Germans the bad in these movies, and the one who wins in the end is always the good. 
It is very dangerous to transform this humanitarian tragedy into such superficial conclusions. 
Why should the West change and transform; its basic principles are the same. When divine revelation is rejected and replaced by manmade dogmas, nothing changes. Just the form changes but the essence remains the same.

We put up with the standard inscription that the marble artisan produces using a fiberglass pattern. 
The state of Muslims living in Western countries is gradually becoming similar to those of the Jews under the Nazi regime. Social and official pressures on these people are increasing and Muslims are being subjected to extreme social isolation in Western societies, renowned as the best examples of cohabitation. 
Hence, alQaeda must be an irrational organization because Muslims are isolated by the Western world due to the acts of this organization. 
Realizing this hope depends on considering the history. A Europe lacking history would be an orphan and futureless. 
In other words, one should not suddenly put on the brakes in a way to make the car skid off the road, because other risks and drawbacks would emerge. 
It is wrong to be angry with Kemal Dervis.

Humans and Intellectuals 
Because of a vendetta, or something else, somebody can plan and kill his enemy. 
The main weapon in the terrorist’s hand is: "You will give me what I want or I will continue shedding blood!" 
There is already treachery at some level, what changes the conditions is spreading unawareness. 
What has forced Turkey into this low economic level is mainly terrorism. 
Our losses and wastes are limitless. 
Some are still expecting something from terrorism. 
Terrorism is inherently divisive, it divides and shatters one's inner unity. 
They are conformists to the sorrowful picture, which they are unwilling to change inspite of accepting it as "a tool, desperation or as legal". Life going on is all what they wish. 
We could describe it as coming face to face... 
This model is a social model in essence. 
The first thing he said was, "Democracy is a political regime that needs to be redefined. 
It was all clear: 
To Understand what is Happening in Iraq 
The perpetrators of the attacks on the tombs of the 10th Imam Ali alHadi (829868) and his son alHasan alAskari (846873) were not Sunnis. 
No Sunni can attack the tombs of these two people, the descendants of the Prophet of Muhammad (PBUH). 
The same thing also applies to analyses that we tend to base on the religious, sectarian and racial conflict. 
Then we pause for a moment in the 30s and stagger. 
For example, I was scared of being circumcised. 
Then, taking a look now at those relatives, the heroes of his childhood days, they have all become old and gray. 
Izmir, the pearl of the Aegean Region of Turkey and shining star of tourism, now takes proud of undertaking such a big mission to promote our country besides hosting perfectly these universally acclaimed games. This giant organization allows Turkey to promote its reputation throughout the world. 
Nuri Zengin won the most gold medals in freestyle (two gold medals in 1996 and 1998) and Bunyamin Emik won the most gold medals in GrecoRoman (two gold medals in 2000 and 2002). 
In Turkey, however, there are only a few physical education and sports senior high schools to promote wrestling. 
We will now participate in this worldwide organization with qualified and young sportsmen at national team level both in freestyle and GrecoRoman style. Our 300 athletes will compete in these games. Eyes have not turned on wrestling again in Turkey. 
Before the war, the U. S. which acted all alone on the Iraq issue, now enjoys considerable support from Europe in the Iran standoff. 
Washingtonbased analyses of the Islamic world contain many major mistakes. 
But this turning into a war does not seem likely. 
The Bush administration’s attitude, “you are either with me or with the enemy,” might drag the region into a period of uncertainty. 
As some assume, this is not the apocalypse… 
I wonder, who stands to gain from the failure of democratic moves by stoking fears and suspicions? 
This ominous trap does not target a particular region or class: The powers disturbed by the democratization progress in Turkey are advocating conflict, terrorism; and are planning to start a new period of bloodshed through grudge. 
For this reason, in spite of the pressures on Diyarbakir with a population of 1 million, not many people are taking part in these acts of violence. 
That is the most dangerous development; it should not be allowed to cause provocations. 
Once the economic balance is disturbed, it will require huge efforts to put it back on track. 
Political instability was blamed for the worst economic crisis in 2001. 
It was not politics/politicians alone who footed the bill of chaos and insecurity, though! 
Yeni Safak is right here. 
Those who were offended by our warnings at that time should not act as if they are caught by surprise today. 
On one side, rumors about the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) are being manufactured and passed over to the foreign press. On the other side, the same groups are making sensational moves, relying on the feeling of patriotism inside the country. 
However, examining every issue as part of a legal process would not benefit the country at all. 
I hope placing dynamites in silence, so to speak, to endanger the future of Turkey, would spark reactions this time; because if it continues this way, there wouldn’t be any “friends” left unhurt outside. 
The country that is home to different religions and cultures virtually became enslaved by suspicions and prejudices after this henious act of terror. 
If some adopt a “separatist” style even when they say, “let’s stand up against disintegration,” this implies the issue is becoming ever more complex with every passing day. 
Neither peace nor stability would surface from that point. 
Now, the affairs are in the hands of little men with petty calculations. 
The essence of the matter is not simple. 
The unforeseen dangers of this country cannot be overcome through instigations of those people that are hard to understand the intelligence services of the countries they belong to. 
Now, everyone is a neighbor to one other and everyone ought to contribute to world peace. 
The government benefited from the hard bargaining that took place on October 3. 
All antidemocrats, all exjunta members, all psychological war experts etc. are on the antiEU front. 
They want people to fight continuously and they want chaos to devour the nation’s soul... 
This situation is not new. 
For instance, Westernization was greeted with the fear of decadence, perishment and annihilation. 
However, time revealed that along every trajectory, this nation could find a way out for itself. 
Turkey’s advances will disturb Europe. 
The point we have finally reached is the success of the Turkish state. 
That is the reason why all of Turkey’s foes united, worked together as a team in Luxembourg, Brussels, Paris, Washington etc., and made attempts to prevent Turkey from becoming a member. 
For instance, the widespread opinion among the people is, “These folks are playing hanky panky and at the final point they will reject our membership,” or, “During the negotiation process, that will last 10 to 15 years, the EU will disintegrate anyway.” 
The information leaked to the press has created tremendous reactions. 
It is impossible to understand the reasoning behind making an amendment in a haste, ruling out the freedoms for such a delicate issue as counterterrorism, without the consent of the public opinion and even without the approval of the deputies. 
Forced laws harm both the public conscience and the respect for the Parliament. 
A report published by French newspaper Le Figaro, known for its intimacy with the French government reveals that some EU member countries follow the wrong path. 
What can be gathered from the indulged attitude of some EU member countries is that they perceive the Justice and Development Party (AKP) as in dire dependence on them. 
Neither AKP nor Turkey inheres to the EU; without understanding this initially, to develop policies to hurt Turkey’s dignity – though they are pursued behind closed doorsmeans a clear incapability in analyzing the world thoroughly. 
At a time when the people of southeastern Turkey have gained so much more ground in democracy and freedom as a result of Turkey’s integration process to the European Union (EU), there is clearly no benefit from these kinds of terrorist activities for anybody, especially for the region’s people. 
According to the article, the EU “was hesitant about the placement of article eight of the Law on the Fight Against Terrorism on the agenda because it could lead to restrictions on freedoms of expression.” 
The Turkish Minister of Justice, Cemil Cicek, sent this very clear message to Ismail Kucukkaya, Aksam’s Ankara representative: “What has the existence of OHAL produce in 20 years?” 
Mustafa Karaalioglu, one of the participants in the meeting and a columnist for Yeni Şafak daily, said, “The Prime Minister has promised not to take a step backward in democratization.” 
This is right! 
Officials visiting Europe prior to US President George W. Bush had worked to develop a warmer setting for relations. 
European countries, France and Germany in particular, did not support the America's Middle East politics. 
The truth is that antiAmericanism is spreading dangerously. 
The facts that Turkey neighbors Iraq, that it is a Muslim country ruled by democracy, etc. add to Turkey's importance… 
Both leaders made statements that touched upon Lebanon and urged Syria to "withdraw" from the country. 
When a new chapter is begun, one notes one's own theories as it listens to the opposition … 
In Iraq, however, the US had to bow its head in acceptance of the victory of Shiite groups close to Iran. 
Turkey has many concerns about the developments in Northern Iraq. 
The magic of the diplomatic profession becomes apparent during difficult times like these. 
Turkey should continue its relations with the US on good terms and also maintain balance in the rest of the world. 
Diplomatic foresight allows intervention before tension peaks. 
This finding also concerns the US. 
Turkish diplomacy has solved many crises skillfully, and it should solve this, too. 
The Ambassador’s Two Documents 
The first was a press release on the tsunami disaster. 
The opinion that some countries were not informed about the earthquake in time was also addressed in the press release. 
There are only three days left before a major EU process turning point. 
Actually, Turkey has a powerful hand. 
If the EU isn't going to play fair on December 17, the EU nations will lose respect. 
At a time when the clash of civilizations is sliding into religious conflict and the alliances are tightening while divisions are widening, a Europe that would close its doors on Turkey will be marked responsible in the history books. 
This burden is heavy enough to crush the EU over time… 
The EU also needs to figure out which port a Turkey detached from Europe would set sail toward. 
The existence of marginal groups claiming political instability by their failures as an excuse is also a reality. 
For one, Ulusal Kanal (National Channel) took over sponsorship of the program. 
Calislar's words are chilling. 
Can you imagine that at a program attended by the President, parliament ministers, retired generals and lecturers, three people were stabbed and taken to Gazi University Medical School? 
He asked for Allah's protection from cruel people, evildoers and hypocrites. 
The fight against terrorism is a tough test. 
The U. S. Army intervened in Iraq within the "fight against terrorism" framework. 
One of the reasons is the increase in the number of deaths on a daily basis and the American people questioning the wisdom of this war… 
Moreover, it has to find solutions to the increasing and dangerous antagonism towards the United States. 
The beautiful weather allowed for celebrations throughout the day. 
It is already known for sure that in that period the media was manipulated, some writers were dismissed from their newspapers, and several intellectuals were treated unjustly. 
Many of these practices are abandoned. 
Particularly, during the Chief of the General Staff Hilmi Ozkok's period, Turkish military took a great leap in the name of democracy, for the consolidation of democracy. 
It is impossible to ascribe a meaning to this. 
One of the damages of discriminatory practices is that they strike competition and harm equality. 
I wonder if Renault is aware of what has been going on in Turkey? 
Besides, there is a questionable point in such cases: The firm itself is at the heart of the discrimination, or the agencies responsible for the distribution of the advertisement. 
Discrimination is discrimination; and today someone will be discriminated, tomorrow someone else. 
Everybody is wondering: What will happen now? 
If the only superpower starts pursuing wrong policies, there is no balance factor to fix it. 
For intellectuals it is easy for them to listen to opposition voices as well as offer solutions, by taking their ideas into consideration. 
Minority, Majority, Absurdity 
As they continue to speak, the issues distance themselves from scientific realities and adopt an emotional state. 
Have they not been genuine children of this land for centuries? 
A complete fiasco for the founders. 
Because Alevis are already active in many parties and establishments. 
It took incredible steps in the path to the EU. 
Despite resistance from bureaucracy, the government opened up bold fields of implementation. 
Turkey overcame this gigantic problem as the Cypriot people voted in parallel referenda and the Greek Cypriot side became impudent at the last minute… 
The government, opposition, soldier, civil bureaucracy… Yes, all of them allied against the hurdles in the path to the EU. 
For instance, there may be countries concerned about Turkey's population. 
Double standards by the EU compel Turkey to search for other options. 
It is also very obvious that Europe would not benefit from this. 
However, as [EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter] Verheugen said, it's Turkey that wants to join the EU and not the other way round. 
Had the TCK crisis not occurred in the last minute, it would have been said that "this job has been completed." 
I saw [CHP leader] Deniz Baykal a bit concerned over some issues; nevertheless, he is determined not to make concessions on freedoms. 
Fortunately, I attended the circumcision feast of State Minister Ali Babacan's son. 
Also referring to news reports, Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin said, "You are right, it is necessary to get some overlooked issues straight." 
Hence, his evaluation of issue was quite clear. He smilingly said, "There is no need for concern, a more libertarian law will be enacted." 
Both government and opposition deputies are very sensitive about reactions from NGOs, vocational organizations. 
Cicek, reproached by deputies, reflected in the lobbies. 
A penal code that does not ensure complete freedom of expression, will cause great problems in the future and will always be dubiously remembered. 
Ecevit: Last Leaf Falling from Political Stage 
These colorful faces, who changed the course of the country with their decisions and attitudes, remain in memories now. 
Neither the masses on the left nor those on the right, forgave those who remained passive in the struggle between left and right. 
The capture of Abdullah Ocalan opened the doors to power for him during his last period. 
Political plots forced him to start from the scratch many times. 
When the Cold War era came to an end, NATO's existence became meaningless. 
Besides, a new monster surfaced: Terrorism. 
People were targeted regardless of religious or regional background. 
People have the right to protest of course; however, it should not be turned into antiWestern hostility. 
Leftist organizations, joining the demonstration fray at every given opportunity, cannot renew themselves. 
Kurdish courses were opened and the state of emergency was repealed. Laws were made to jump start the regional economy and Turkey is set to begin Kurdish TV broadcasts. 
A state that struggles against the PKK in its own lands, can hardly object to a formation outside of its borders. 
However, encouraged by the U. S., Turkey made a 'Homecoming Law' and therefore put itself into a position to apply pressure on the U. S. and say, 'take a clear stand against PKK militants'. 
One thing is clear: Turkey's Southeast instantly heatsup whenever it seem to pull together and become more stabilized. 
People, who are bothered by stability, consider the region as Turkey's Achilles heel. 
The American public included, nobody really anticipated this much. 
Bureaucrats are nervous because they are aware they are losing their altitudes. 
At the bottom of incident lies the anger against the nontransparent media. 
The what extent the torture incidents cause grief, to that same extent the reactions against them bring joy. 
As a matter of fact, there was torture even when there was no coup. 
For instance, tipoff on gun possession was very rife during those days. 
In the past, one could even ask a police officer for an address. 
Many important guests, including Industry and Trade Minister Ali Coskun and State Minister Mehmet Aydin, participated in the meeting that was organized by Beykent University and the Stevens Institute of Technology. 
The problem is so profound and complicated. 
It is not easy, it requires mutual respect, selfconfidence, consciousness and experience… 
Intercivilizations dialogue, tolerance and peace were mentioned under the roof of Stevens… Prof. Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu talked about how people of different religions, lived freely under Islamic rule. 
Because Stevens is a foundation that has close contacts with the Pentagon, it generates projects for them [Pentagon], mulls over advanced space technology etc. 
Actually, when the research center is mentioned, places producing scenarios come to mind. 
The Turkish side said a categorical 'yes' while Greek side said 'no.' 
[TRNC President] Rauf Denktas made a historic mistake. 
The Cypriot leader was trying to set the military and the government against each other. 
They actually meant, 'Pasha should have directly said no.' 
To what extent was it right to consider 'yes' as equal to betrayal, while the government said, 'whatever the outcome, this would reflect the Cypriot people's choice and we will respect that will'? 
Did journalists, who wanted Denktas to be invited to the War Academy and make him address the future leaders, by asking Ozkok Pasha unexpected questions do the right thing, or was it the General Staff which did the right thing? 
All of these programs seemed better than each other and were all detailed. And there was one I really enjoyed watching when this opportunity came across. 
Firstly, Kirli asks a tricky question: "Do you think you are a conscientious voter?" 
Let's assume that such marked differences exist. Shouldn't the 'elites' be the more 'conscientious voters?' 
Evaluating the RefahYol ['Refah Party''Dogru Yol Party' coalition] experience very well, the government did not indulge in regime polemics and developed policies that pleased the people. 
Why did some candidates (including Celal Dogan) garner much more votes than the party itself? 
However, these parties apparently are on the edge of the election thresholdlike walking on thin ice. 
Some do not get tired of being bashed in every election… 
90Deep Shock Experienced Over Cyprus 
Is there anyone who remembers the atmosphere in Turkey prior to the New York talks? 
This is the most interesting part of the issue: On certain fronts in the Cyprus issue, any comment would excommunicate people. 
They believed that Mr. Rauf would maintain his 'Mister No' title and would not embarrass the 'nationalist cooperation.' 
This consensus platform has weakened the groups that are eager to cause a commotion. 
Remember what was expressed regarding the Iraq war. 
Is performance not also important in international politics? 
This year it is our turn to roar. 
As if the first confusion, something caused one after the other in attempts over Cyprus, is bring experienced now. 
The prime minister was so focused on the Bush meeting that he did not even care about the heating system not working properly. 
Making his final preparations before the Bush meeting, the prime minister did not want to be stunned by any surprise demand from the White House. 
Turkey will not panic before those who want to change the course of events with lastminute attacks. 
A lot of ground was covered before coming to Washington: forming a new government after the elections in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) has given the government some leverage. 
That's why he makes unexpected statements. 
Erdogan's main aim is to avoid a technical debate. 
The Prime Minister is apparently going to the White House prepared and with a clear plan of action. 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan delivered a very clear message early this week: "We are determined to keep the regime alive". 
For instance, a leaflet, distributed by the CHP Menemen District Organization and its meeting went beyond political opposition. 
It was at least provocative. 
I heartily accept the motto, “That government is best which governs least”; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. 
But it is not the less necessary for this; for the people must have some complicated machinery or other, and hear its din, to satisfy that idea of government which they have. 
Yet this government never of itself furthered any enterprise, but by the alacrity with which it got out of its way. 
It is truly enough said that a corporation has no conscience; but a corporation on conscientious men is a corporation with a conscience. 
Law never made men a whit more just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the welldisposed are daily made the agents on injustice. 
They have the same sort of worth only as horses and dogs. 
But he that would save his life, in such a case, shall lose it. 
I hear of a convention to be held at Baltimore, or elsewhere, for the selection of a candidate for the Presidency, made up chiefly of editors, and men who are politicians by profession; but I think, what is it to any independent, intelligent, and respectable man what decision they may come to? 
But no: I find that the respectable man, so called, has immediately drifted from his position, and despairs of his country, when his country has more reasons to despair of him. 
O for a man who is a man, and, and my neighbor says, has a bone is his back which you cannot pass your hand through! 
If I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them sitting upon another man’s shoulders. I must get off him first, that he may pursue his contemplations too. 
See what gross inconsistency is tolerated. 
The soldier is applauded who refuses to serve in an unjust war by those who do not refuse to sustain the unjust government which makes the war; is applauded by those whose own act and authority he disregards and sets at naught; as if the state were penitent to that degree that it hired one to scourge it while it sinned, but not to that degree that it left off sinning for a moment. 
The slight reproach to which the virtue of patriotism is commonly liable, the noble are most likely to incur. 
If you are cheated out of a single dollar by your neighbor, you do not rest satisfied with knowing you are cheated, or with saying that you are cheated, or even with petitioning him to pay you your due; but you take effectual steps at once to obtain the full amount, and see to it that you are never cheated again. 
They take too much time, and a man’s life will be gone. 
I think that it is enough if they have God on their side, without waiting for that other one. 
Moreover, any man more right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one already. 
When I converse with the freest of my neighbors, I perceive that, whatever they may say about the magnitude and seriousness of the question, and their regard for the public tranquillity, the long and the short of the matter is, that they cannot spare the protection of the existing government, and they dread the consequences to their property and families of disobedience to it. 
But, unfortunately, another man saw fit to pay it. 
I did not see why the lyceum should not present its tax bill, and have the State to back its demand, as well as the Church. 
I was put into a jail once on this account, for one night; and, as I stood considering the walls of solid stone, two or three feet thick, the door of wood and iron, a foot thick, and the iron grating which strained the light, I could not help being struck with the foolishness of that institution which treated my as if I were mere flesh and blood and bones, to be locked up. 
The prisoners in their shirtsleeves were enjoying a chat and the evening air in the doorway, when I entered. 
But the jailer said, “Come, boys, it is time to lock up”; and so they dispersed, and I heard the sound of their steps returning into the hollow apartments. 
It was to see my native village in the light of the Middle Ages, and our Concord was turned into a Rhine stream, and visions of knights and castles passed before me. 
It was a closer view of my native town. 
This is one of its peculiar institutions; for it is a shire town. 
My neighbors did not this salute me, but first looked at me, and then at one another, as if I had returned from a long journey. 
You do not resist cold and hunger, the winds and the waves, thus obstinately; you quietly submit to a thousand similar necessities. 
I am but too ready to conform to them. 
His words are wisdom to those legislators who contemplate no essential reform in the existing government; but for thinkers, and those who legislate for all tim, he never once glances at the subject. 
If we were left solely to the wordy wit of legislators in Congress for our guidance, uncorrected by the seasonable experience and the effectual complaints of the people, America would not long retain her rank among the nations. 
When Darwin proposed his theory, he based his claims on a mechanism he called "natural selection" that by itself, had no evolutionary capabilities. 
Certainly all living things must seek out food and safety; and every creature must hunt for nourishment and become aggressive in its own defense. 
In the next few pages, you will be reading about some of the astonishing and admirable behaviors exhibited by animals, who have no power of intellect. 
Beavers construct the outside walls of their nests by piling up the building materials they gather, filling every crevice with twigs and mud, making sure not to leave any holes or cavities. 
If this intellect and planning do not belong to the beaver, who does it belong to? 
The answer is God, Who brings out superior features in beavers, as well as in many other creatures, of which we'll see many examples as we progress through the following chapters. With His infinite reason and power, God has created them, brings out their superior qualities by His inspiration, and commands them to effect their ingenious plans. 
But also, it would present an easy meal. A dry leaf's difference in color would give it away, attracting the attention of birds and spelling doom for the caterpillar. 
The caterpillar does not have the faculty of thought to let it plan ahead. 
Scientists use the word instinct to define animals' inborn behaviors. 
From inside them comes a drink of varying colors, containing healing for mankind. 
There is certainly a Sign in that for people who reflect. 
Yet if we look at the behaviors that we've been examining from the start, we do notice that some features meet the criteria of intelligence. 
Can a mother's love be explained by the blind process of natural selection, which has no spiritual aspects? 
This is why, so often in the natural world, we witness extremely conscious behavior in unthinking animals that makes us ask, "How can any animal know this?" or "How could this creature think that?" 
Biologists assume freely that such inheritance of specific behavior patterns is possible, and indeed that it regularly occurs. 
Some forms of behavior are, certainly; we have no way of knowing that all are. 
But the plain fact is that the genetic mechanism shows not the slightest sign of being able to convey specific behavior patterns. 
It may well be asked, how is it possible to reconcile this case with the theory of natural selection?12 
What shall we say to the instinct which leads the bee to make cells, and which has practically anticipated the discoveries of profound mathematicians?14 
There is no creature He does not hold by the forelock. 
According to this claim, every being needs to be stronger, fitter than its counterparts, and must fight to survive. 
For this reason, each individual must be as selfish as possible and consider only its own needs—its food, personal safety, and defending its nest. 
Not even a respectable scientist like Huxley could exempt himself from this error.16 
But in stinging, they will have committed suicide. 
From then on, she will keep them either in her mouth or on her body until they become selfsufficient. 
While her baby gains weight, she continues to lose it. 
In such a situation, one might assume that the stronger individuals would eliminate the others and seek to keep the limited resources for themselves. 
To the contrary, it can be observed that even in the hardest of times, there is solidarity and cooperation in nature, as if each animal were trying to help ease the conditions for the others. 
No doubt it is God, the Lord of all the universe, Who created these creatures, inspires them to the most befitting behavior, and guards them at all times. 
As we saw in the preceding pages, evolutionists cannot explain the important subject of animals' devotional behavior... 
The late Stephen Jay Gould, a renowned evolutionist, stated that acts of devotion in nature pose "the vexatious problem of altruism."21 Gordon R. Taylor, giving voice to the evolutionists' woes, says that living beings' devotional behavior "has long presented a challenge for Darwinism."22 Wholly "spiritual" qualities like care and compassion deal a clear sharp blow to the materialist worldview that views nature as the sum total of random interactions of matter. 
In this case, even if a creature's genes were programmed to act selflessly so that the species might continue, this would clearly indicate the existence of an intelligent, knowledgeable power that programmed the genes this way in the first place. 
Clearly, in short, animals help one another and act selflessly because God commands them to do so. 
As we continue through the book, we'll see many more examples of selfless altruism, compassion, and devotion. 
It must not be forgotten that God has created these animals in the most perfect way, making them behave in this way. 
Female elephants stay together with their mothers and even their grandmothers.25 
He can easily protect himself, but must take care for and protect the other family members as well. 
Each adult begins to call at high pitch and the young birds recognize their parents by their sound and move towards them.28 No doubt, recognition by voice is under these circumstances the most appropriate method for the thousands of penguins. 
Perhaps the rocks? 
The nests most carefully prepared are those built for the expected arrival of the young. 
First off, they'd have to realize the need for a nest for the safety of their eggs and young. 
Quite aside from their architectural perfection, the extraordinary dedication that parents invest in building their nests is certainly worth noticing. 
According to Darwin's natural selection theory, these animals should be concerned only with themselves. 
Natural selection cannot answer these questions; neither can the theory of evolution, nor any other atheist ideology. 
Woven nests in particular trap body heat, providing warmth for the chicks—but constructing these structures is a detailed and difficult undertaking. 
Nests are built taking into account the elasticity, durability and toughness of the different materials birds use—mud, leaves, feathers, cellulose and the like. 
The real entrance to the brooding chamber is concealed, while the other entrance is readily visible, presenting a false doorway to any predators.31 
As thread, it uses silk from cobwebs, cotton from seeds, and fibers of tree bark. 
It then punches holes along the edges of each leaf, and pulls the spider silk or plant fiber through the holes to sew the leaves together, finally tying knots in each stitch to keep it from slipping. 
It will cut long strips from leaves or extract the midrib from a fresh green leaf. 
To prevent the fibers from falling away, it ties them together with knots. 
During the weaving process, it must calculate the required tension, because if it's too weak, the nest will collapse. 
Weaver birds repeat this process until their nest is complete. It's no doubt impossible to claim that they have acquired these skills unconsciously, by chance. 
Surely not—like all other creatures in nature, they too act by the directives of God. 
Bank swallows, for instance, dig long tunnels in the sides of steep slopes along rivers and shorelines. 
One would expect any bird attempting this feat to be crushed in midair under the tons of water. 
Each wave breaking against the shore completely floods the entrance to the cave. 
Before they begin to build their nests, swiftlets determine the highest water level by observing the marks that water leaves on the walls around the cave entrance, and then build their nests above that.40 
The first thing they need to do is build a safe nest for the female and their offspring. 
When the young hatch, they too are fed by the same way.44 Both birds are very patient and dedicated to their offspring. 
However, these creatures clearly demonstrate the products of intelligence, reason, planning and design and compassionate and altruistic behavior. 
After an incubation period of from four to five days, the larvae hatch and begin to feed on the pollen and nectar readied for them. 
It is noteworthy that the creature that distributes nectar where the young can reach it and builds a system that will ensure healthy growth for the young bees that will form the colony is not a being of intelligence, but a little bee only a few centimeters in size. 
While the outside temperature measured below30 C (22 F) degrees, the internal temperature never fell below 2 to3 degrees. 
How does the mother bear know that the roof's insulation property changes according to its thickness? This has been the subject of scientific curiosity. 
During her hibernation, the mother bear reduces her metabolism rate, so as not to use up any energy and to provide more milk for her cubs. 
Sitting in this pool, the smith frog makes its mating call until it attracts the attention of a female frog. 
Consider whether it's possible for someone who's never worked on a building site before, without anyone to explain materials or how to use them and with no plan to fall back on, to build himself a perfect residence. 
They mix mortar and insulate their nests with easily obtained materials. 
Neither Mother Nature nor chance can program them to build sophisticated nests. 
Even if only a few survive, they are enough to guarantee the continuation of the species, because of the original high numbers involved. 
This action cools the eggs by shading them when it's too hot; when it is too cool, she warms them by vibrating her body. 
In the mating season, the females lay their eggs onto the ground, and the males gather to form a protective shield around the eggs. 
For instance, after the Pipa toad spawns, the male frog gathers the eggs with his webbed feet and places them on the female's back. 
In all these examples, one important point must not be missed. 
The behavior of these frogs is in complete harmony with their physical characteristics. 
One of these frogs has a sac made for the spawn that extends right down the underside of its body. 
The female frequently gets up and turns the eggs so they will warm evenly.61 
Once the female lays her eggs, her mate takes over the responsibility of looking after them. 
It's not likely that any bird, snake or ant should know the importance of proper temperature and then, all by itself, discover an appropriate method for keeping temperatures at the needed level. 
After this difficult exercise, he buries the egg in his feathers. 
In the first stages of their lives, baby penguins cannot generate their own body heat. If left alone, they die within minutes. 
These visits and greeting rituals give the female an idea about her mate's due date and in this time, the female prepares to produce new eggs.67 
They wait for the full moon, because then the tides are bigger and waves can reach further up the shore. They await the high tide, which lasts for three hours, and then come ashore with the biggest wave they can ride. 
Both male and female cichlids take good care of their spawn and young. 
Once the young emerge, the parents keep on protecting them. 
This is a difficult task for such a small creature, but the wasp first lifts the soil with its jaw and then throws it behind with its front legs. 
In this enclosed and wellprotected burrow, with the food it has, the larva will develop into an adult and can then emerge by itself.80 
Smaller, weaker mammals prefer to conceal their young or take their offspring somewhere safe in order to protect them. 
She will try to stay close up behind the fleeing fawn, and if the predator comes close, she will try to divert it away. 
Sometimes, however, the young need to be guided by their mothers in order to take advantage of this feature. 
Very cautious, she will visit her young only to nurse it. 
Her "performance" invariably attracts the predator's attention. It approaches in the expectation of an easy meal, not realizing it's being led away from the bird's nest. 
Also, the bird would have to be very brave to offer itself without hesitating and let the predator stalk it. 
Millions of different species populate this Earth, each with its own defense mechanisms. 
More important than these systems is the lesson they teach us. 
The grebes serve as floating nests for their own young. 
Fish bones and other indigestible matter are caught there, preventing damage to the delicate lining of the stomach and intestinal walls. 
If however the adult bird catches the fish just any which way, it will swallow the fish itself.101 
Like the guacharo, many other animal species will prepare food before feeding it to their young. 
At the slightest vibration that could indicate their parents' return, young thrushes, still blind, stretch their necks upwards and open their beaks wide in anticipation, as if the swollen yellow rims of these young birds' beaks were indicating where their parents should deposit their food. 
The edges of their gapes are quite sensitive. If a baby has its beak closed for whatever reason, the slightest touch will stimulate it to open its beak. 
Their young have brightly colored green and blue knobs at the corners of their gapes, which act as reflectors for the little light that filters through into the deeper corners of the nest. 
Sandgrouse that Carry Water to Their Offspring 
When they need to lay eggs, they find a shallow hole in the sand and lay three eggs at most. 
We need to reflect on a number of aspects in sandgrouse's behavior. 
While being transported, the young are not harmed in any way and are quickly taken to a safe environment. 
With her baby on her back, the mother can easily climb up a tree, run along a branch, and jump to the next tree. 
When it leaves the pouch, it will not stray far for the first few days. 
Some bats can still fly with three or four young all holding onto their body. 
More interestingly, some fish carry their young to safety in their mouths. 
Some gazelles, on the other hand, make a strange hopping display for the same purpose.113 
It's not possible for humans to detect the direction of this call—important for any flock of birds, because any one bird risks drawing attention to itself by making this noise.114 But the danger of this happening in this case is very limited. 
Their network of burrows is like an underground village, each burrow housing approximately 30 of them. 
But if hares know to run when they see this signal, they must have agreed it beforehand by communicating about it. How else could they put it into practice all at once? 
Starlings fly in flocks with wide spaces in between. 
When their herd comes under attack, mammals too act as one body. 
American white pelicans, for instance, always hunt in teams. 
The conclusion any rational person will draw is this: Everything in nature is the work of an infinitely knowledgeable and powerful Creator. 
Mammals especially are exposed to great dangers during birth, when both mother and her baby become easy prey for predators. 
However, when a pregnant animal is ready to give birth, another animal of the herd is commonly present. 
But the mother, still weak from giving birth, cannot keep up with the agility of her young one. Her assistants help provide the protection the baby needs.127 
Adult baboons will adopt orphaned young animals. 
It will admit only ants belonging to its colony and refuse entrance to all others. 
Along with sharing food, ants will also share, with as many other ants they can, information about the location of food sources. 
In their behavior, there is no sign of selfish struggle. 
A few of the worker ants serve as living storage tanks. 
Then she seals off the entrance and remains inside without food for weeks, even months, all alone. Later she will lay her first eggs as a queen ant. 
They carry them outside the nest and hide them somewhere safe until the attack has been fought off.138 It would be expected for a creature like the ant to be concerned only with itself, seeking a place to hide. 
This is selfless devotion at the highest level, and all ants have been behaving in this way for millions of years. 
We can list the phases of a worker bee's life and its devotional behavior as follows: 
The worker lives off the pollen and honey from the feed store, but feeds most of it to the larvae. 
Before worker bees set out to find food, they have another important obligation to fulfill: guard duty. 
To such questions, evolutionists have no answers. 
From a rational, logical point of view, it is impossible for beings devoid of skill and reason to give to other beings qualities such as awareness, intelligence, knowledge, skills or any other mental faculty. 
The truth is clear and open for all to see: God is most compassionate and most merciful, He is the Creator and Sustainer of all living things, and it is He Who makes animals' behavior devoted, compassionate and merciful. 
This theory, which claims that life emerged by chance from inanimate matter, was invalidated by the scientific evidence of clear "design" in the universe and in living things. 
Given the enormous importance of this subject, it will be of great benefit to summarize it here. 
In this book, he denied that Allah created different living species on Earth separately, for he claimed that all living beings had a common ancestor and had diversified over time through small changes. 
How a single cell could generate millions of complex living species and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions that the theory cannot answer. 
The cell of a living thing is more complex than all of our manmade technological products. 
Today, even in the most developed laboratories of the world, a living cell cannot be produced by bringing organic chemicals together. 
The probability of proteins, the building blocks of a cell, being synthesized coincidentally, is 1 in 10950 for an average protein made up of 500 amino acids. 
This fact explicitly invalidates the theory of evolution, whose main purpose is to deny creation. 
So, how could these "favorable variations" occur? 
The subject most often brought up by advocates of the theory of evolution is the subject of the origin of man. 
This scheme is imaginary because it has never been proved that there is an evolutionary relation between these different classes. 
This is how many ideas, such as the Earthcentered universe model, have been taken out of the agenda of science throughout history.

And instead of letting that scare me, I kept on going. 
Come here, man. 
Paul, my husband, he's dying, and I want to have his baby. 
Whoo! I win. 
Do you wanna go to theJacuzzi for a while? 
If you're saved and you know it, say "Amen." 
Have you been smoking again? 
Jack, boss wants to talk to you. 
I went to a fertility clinic. 
I could take care ofhim. 
This is what I most want in the world. 
Well, life goes on, right? 
It's your party, remember? 
Good. Your lungs are clear. 
Your husband suffered multiple skull fractures, and we had to remove blood clots from around the brain. 
I don't drink, Brown. 
How about a Diet Coke? 
I'm here to give you some information on organ donation. 
Hello? Yes, I'm calling on behalf of Mr. Paul Rivers. 
Hang on a sec. 
My duty's to God. 
I also have an announcement to make. 
She's done nothing but eat since Robert left her. 
I don't have anything to think about. 
Would you help me with the glasses? 
Thanks. 
I just wanna be alone. 
The donor's name was Michael Peck. 
And I also have the widow's phone number and address just in case you're interested. 
You might have seen it in the newspaper. 
This guy named JackJordan ran over Mr. Peck and his two little girls October 10 at 6.;50 p. m. 
I can explain. 
Why didn't you tell me that when you were sick, huh? 
It was an accident. 
And you taught me that. 
Look, if you don't like them, you don't pay for them. 
This is God's will. 
This is a clean gun, no record. 
Let me just give you my cell phone number so you can have it. 
Hey, Lucio, don't forget to do my garden on Saturday. 
I need you to stay in the hospital until I can find you another heart. 
You didn't bring me a present, huh? 
Thank you, sweetheart. 
I guess I try to tell them that numbers are a door to understanding a mystery that's bigger than us. 
GGetGet Take your shoes off and get down on your knees. 
One of the girls that I killed, she looked me in the eye. 
Cell Phone Rings. 
You understand what I'm saying? 
Get out of my house now! 
Why did you leave us, Jack? 
But right now what we really need are units of Bpositive blood. 
We can't keep doing this. 
You decide if you come looking for me or not. 
Hi, honey. I'm on my way home. 
You don't need it. 
At least she could be here with me. That son of a bitch is walking the streets, and I can't even go into their room. 
You just let them lie there on the street. 
Don't even go back to the motel and get your things. 
We weren't able to use your blood for his transfusion. 
Nobody will ever find the body. 
I know. 
How many lives do we live? 
On 30 June 1908, Moscow escaped destruction by three hours and four thousand kilometresa margin invisibly small by the standards of the universe. 
In those days, there was nothing that men could do to protect themselves against the last random shots in the cosmic bombardment that had once scarred the face of the Moon. The meteorites of 1908 and 1947 had struck uninhabited wilderness; but by the end of the twenty first century, there was no region left on Earth that could be safely used for celestial target practice. The human race had spread from pole to pole. And so, inevitably. 
But the loss to art, to history, to scienceto the whole human race, for the rest of timewas beyond all computation. 
31/439 was not travelling on a normal asteroidal path, along an ellipse which it retraced with clockwork precision every few years. 
Dr William Stenton would never have been able to grab the Farside twohundredmetre reflector for a full quarter of an hour, if a more impor tant programme had not been temporarily derailed by the failure of a fifty cent capacitor. 
Bill Stenton did not know what he had caught until the next day, when he was able to get computer time to process his results. 
Even when they were finally flashed on his display screen, it took him several minutes to under stand what they meant. 
The Antarctic icecap could melt and flood all low4ying land; or the oceans could freeze and the whole world be locked in an eternal winter. 
No starsized mass could penetrate so deeply into the solar system without producing disturbances which would have betrayed it long ago. 
The orbits of all the planets would have been affected; that, after all, was how Neptune, Pluto and Persephone had been discovered. 
Even in the twentysecond cen tury, no way had yet been discovered of keeping elderly and conservative scientists from occupying crucial ad ministrative positions. 
At rather a horrifying cost, a spaceprobe soon to be launched from Mars to beyond Neptune could be modi fied and sent on a highspeed trajectory to meet Rama. 
There was no hope of a rendezvous; it would be the fast est flyby on record, for the two bodies would pass each other at two hundred thousand kilometres an hour. 
That was a grave tactical error, because the three most ardent supporters of the Modified Steady State Theory were also members of the Council. 
It was far too light to be a solid body. 
The mass of Rama was at least ten million million tons; to any spaceman, that was not only an aweinspiring, but a terrifying thought. 
In every earlier landing he had known what to expect; there was always the possibility of accident, but never of surprise. 
Landing a fivethousandton spaceship at the centre of a spinning disc was the least of Commander Norton's worries. 
In three minutes,' said Joe, without taking his eyes from the display, 'we'll know if it's made of antimatter.' 
This was the logical place for the main entrance, and Norton thought it might be UN wise to block the front door with his own vessel. 
At first, the centrifugal force would be very weak, but it would be continuous and inexorable. 
It would hold Endeavour against the plain with a force of several tons, and if the surface was sufficiently rough the ship might stay near the Pole. 
The few grammes of weight that Rama's combined gravitational and centrifugal fields gave them were neither help nor hindrance; they had to rely entirely on their jets. 
As soon as possible, Norton told himself, he would string a cat'scradle of guide ropes between the ship and the pillboxes, so that they could move around without wasting propellants. 
Re assured, he began to drift around the circular structure, trying to determine its purpose. 
Norton thought once more of his instructions. 
If he checked every single move with Mission Control, he would never get anywhere. 
It's obviously amanual control for an airlockprob ably an emergency backup system in case of power fail ure. 
Let's try the other way,' suggested Mercer. 
A few particles of dust, driven by wisps of escaping air, streamed outwards like dazzling diamonds as the brilliant sunlight caught them. 
He knew now that he would never return to his home planet, even though it was only five hours away by shut tle. 
He was exiled for ever from the world of his birth; not being a sentimental man, thishad never depressed him unduly. 
Dr Bose knew nothing of the infighting that had preceded the launch of the first probe to Rama, but the Professor's colleagues had not let him forget it. 
Dr Bose considered that this sort of technological tour de force was an unnecessary gim mick, but it was surprising how many undeniably great men were childishly delighted to be in two places at once. 
And it was even funnier to watch projections trying to shake hands... 
It was true that the Space Sur vey was part of the UPbut on the Operations, not the Science side. 
I can answer that,' said Professor Davidson, his fingers flying over the keyboard of his memory pad. 
Pandoraparanoia,' snorted Conrad Taylor. 
Thank you, Sir Robert,' replied Dr Bose. 
Now, he could make one long 'gram and dupe it, adding only briefper sonal messages and endearments before shooting the al most identical copies off to Mars and Earth. 
We suspect that some kind of shuttle runs inside these, to tow equipment or peopleback and forth. 
We're in the final lock chamber now, awaiting the OK from Earth before we go through. 
Even now, there's still not the slightest sound, or hint of any activity. 
Inside what? 
There was nothing particularly ex otic or alien about the scene: in fact, it bore a consider able resemblance to an abandoned mine. 
Before he had reached the quarter minute it was out of sight; when he had got to a hundred be shielded his eyes and aimed the camera. 
From his viewpoint at the central axis he could see such a mass of detail on the curving walls surrounding him that his mind could not absorb more than a minute fraction of it.; he was looking at the landscape of an entire world by a single flash of lightning, and he tried by a deliberate effort of will to freeze the image in his mind. 
If he moved away from this central axis, towards the curving wall which he must no longer think of as a wall, gravity would steadily increase. 
Whatever discov eries the future might bring, they could never erase this first impression. And History could never take from him the privilege of being the first of all mankind to gaze upon the works of an alien civilization. 
The stairwayswe've called them Alpha, Beta, Gammaaren't continuous, but break at five more circular terraces. 
Though they had already studied these for many hours, Commander Norton's voice added a dimension which no pictures could convey. 
Dr Perera, I believe you have some comments to make?' 
But the old cosmologist still seemed to be in a mild state of shock, and was clearly out of his element. 
But now there was proof that life not only existed out side the solar system, but had scaled heights far beyond anything that man had achieved, or could hope to reach for centuries to come. 
This was the thesis which, without proof but with con siderable armwaving, Dr Carlisle Perera had been preach ing for years. 
He was now a very happy man, though also a most frustrated one. 
It's an old idea in the astronautical literature; I've been able to trace it back to the British physicist J. D. Bernal, who proposed this method of interstellar colon ization in a book published in 1929yes, two hundred years ago. 
So it may make more sense to take your timeten thousand, a hundred thousand years... 
No such thing as centrifugal force. 
The oceans will dry up, the at mosphere will leak away... 
But not out here, in the scat tered population of the spiral arms. 
The stars will never again be the same to us: CHAPTER TENDescent into Darkness Commander Norton was sorely temptedbut, as captain his first duty was to his ship. 
No one took this explanation very seriously and it was generally agreed that Will rated zero for ambition. 
He sometimes wondered if he should attempt to cure himself of this habit, but he could not see that it had any disadvantages. It could make even the dullest situa tions interesting andwho could tell?one day it might save his life. 
He would remember what Fairbanks or Connery or Hiroshi had done in similar circumstances... 
It was not too difficult to imagine that they were at the bottom of an immense shellcrater, though one that had somehow become neatly tailored into a series of ascending terraces. 
But beyond thatover the rim of the most distant ter racewas darkness and mystery. 
He grasped the first rung and gently propelled himself along the ladder. Movement was as effortless as swim ming along the seabedmore so, in fact, for there was no backward drag of water. 
It was so easy that there was a temptation to go too fast, but Mercer was much too ex perienced to hurry in a situation as novel as this. 
He knew perfectly well that this was merely the effect of Rama's spin, but it seemed as if some mysterious force was gently pushing him away from the ladder. 
Their weight was still less than ten kilogrammes, but that was enough to give a feeling of stability. 
Norton replied without hesitation. 
It did not take Mercer long to make a fundamental discovery. 
This stairway was built to walk up, not down!' he exclaimed. 'You can use the steps when you're moving against gravity, but they're just a nuisance in this direc tion. 
I doubt if they ever used this stairwayit's obviously only for emergencies. 
He walkedor, more accurately, glidedto the edge of the platform, and shone his helmetlight down the next section of the stairway. 
There's no change of temperature,' he reported to Commander Norton. 'Still just below freezing. 
Jumpcatch hold of a rungjumpcatchjump catch... it was easy, but so boringly repetitious that there was danger of becoming careless. 
It was bad enough when they were motionless; but when they started to move, and sympathetic vibrations set in, it was more than any warmblooded male should be asked to take. 
Please pass the word.' 
Besides its own lamps, any party down there will always have a beam play ing on it.' 
Thanks, Laurathat's all I want to know. 
I'll get the Exec working on the details. 
But so be it. 
So he took pity on him and added gently: 'And I bet Joe will beat me to the top.' 
In zero gravity, a prehensile tail is an enormous advantage, and all attempts to supply these to humans had turned into embarrassing failures. 
Each weighed less than thirty kilos and consumed only half the food and oxygen of a human being, but each could replace 2.75 men for house keeping, elementary cooking, toolcarrying and dozens of other routine jobs. 
Thereafter thejob of euthing was transferred to the chief medical officer, who it was felt would have less emotional involvement. 
It had been, just as they had hoped and expected, a completely uneventful descent. 
Perhaps they had only been required during the actual construction of Rama, and had served no purpose since that distant day. 
They were univers ally respected and even liked, especially as they made no attempt to convert others. 
There may be pic tures, statuesperhaps even bodies, over in those towns. 
If they are towns.' And the nearest is only eight kilometres away,' said Joe Calvert hopefully. 
Up in the ship, Dr Ernst would be watching the outputs of the biotelemetering sensors attached to his body. 
They might have been walking along a very wide, shallow valley; it was quite impossible to be lieve that they were really crawling along the inside of a huge cylinder, and that beyond this little oasis of light the land rose up to meetno, to becomethe sky. 
Every footstep, every word, vanished instantly into the unreverberant void; after they had gone little more than half a kilo metre, Lt Calvert could stand it no longer. 
It was a good try, but it didn't work, even as a morale builder. 
Yet now, for the first time, he had a sensenot exactly of foreboding, but of anticipation. 
He had walked no more than a dozen metres when it hit him like a thunderbolt. 
Then, to his immense relief, common sense came to the rescue. The disturbing sensation of dÈj‡vu faded out, to be replaced by a real and identifiable memory from his youth. 
They had explored abandoned coalmines and cot ton mills, climbed over ruined blastfurnaces and steam engines, goggled unbelievingly at primitive (and still dan gerous) nuclear reactors, and driven priceless' turbine powered antiques along restored motor roads. 
But where it was necessary to make copies, they had been re constructed with loving care. 
What is it, Skipper?' called Lt Rodrigo. 'Have you found something?' 
He was rather pleased about that last abstention. 
The anthropologist had rapidly lost interest in Rama, when it became obvious that it would present little scope for him. 
And they appear to have been extruded out of the groundthere are no seams or jointslook at this close up of the base of a wallthere's a smooth transition into the ground. My own feeling is that this place is not a residential area, but a storage or supply depot. 
In support of that theory, look at this photo These narrow slots or grooves, about five centimetres wide, run along all the streets, and there's one leading to every buildinggoing straight into the wall .There's a striking resemblance to the streetcar tracks of the early twentieth century; they are obviously part of some trans port system. 
It's still widely used in museums that are short of storage space; no one knows what's inside some of the hundredyearold cocoons in the Smithsonian base ment.' 
Patience was not one of Carlisle Perera's virtues; he was aching to drop his bombshell, and could restrain himself no longer. 
For one detail had been overlookedbecause it was so large that no one had noticed it before. 
I can answer in one word, Mr Ambassador. 
It was also quite monotonous, walking forward in the beam of the searchlight through the anechoic darkness of Rama. 
'Better slow down.' 
Only in the line directly ahead, parallel to the axis of Rama, was normalcy preserved. 
Conscious of the now invisible cliff at their feet, they all stepped back a few metres. 
The more Dr Ernst stared at it, the more certain she became that it was not a city at all. 
The beam of the searchlight slowly tracked along those distant towers and domes and interlocked spheres and crisscrossed tubes. 
After a few minutes, they called for the light to return to them, and began to walk eastwards along the edge of the cliff. 
And one crew man, who was a keen sailor, had raised an interesting conjecture. 
The material felt exactly like ice. 
If it became necessary to quarantine Endeavour, that would be a very small price to pay for her cargo of knowledge. 
The heated air at the Equatorwhich shares the Earth's sixteenhundredkilometresanhour spinruns into the same problem when it rises and flows north and south.' 
I believe they'll last only a few hours, and then spine kind of equilibrium will be restored. 
Until now the movement of air had not been of the slightest professional concern. 
It was Norton's private dream, which he knew he would never achieve, to retrace at least one of Cook's voy ages around the world. 
He had made a limited but spectacular start, which would certainly have astonished the Captain, when he once flew a polar orbit directly above the Great Barrier Reef. 
That had been part of Cook's genius; he always made the right choiceuntil the very end, at Kealakekua Bay. 
Please specify meaning of phrase sudden onset". 
But the train of thought was broken, and he could not get back into the mood. 
At least, around Ship's midnight, he went to sleep. 
It reached the edge of the Sea, then started to track along it, scanning around the interior of the world. 
It was no longer static and frozen in the grip of an eternal winter; a huge area, kilometres across, was in turbulent movement. And it was changing colour; a broad band of white was marching across the ice. 
It was splintering into hundreds of floating islands, that would<crash and jostle into each other until they too melted. 
'So now we know,' he added very calmly, 'why there is a cliff.' 
Presumably, it would be a dead calm there, as at the centre of a cyclone, and they could wait out the expected storm in safety. 
And Rama was not merely a completely novel system; it was also undergoing rapid changes, for the temperature had risen several degrees in the last few hours. 
Yet still there was no sign of the promised hurri cane, though there had been a few feeble gusts from ap parently random directions. 
Then his training took over, and he began to apply the first remedy for panic. 
As he checked off the names one by one, and received answerseven if somewhat tremulous onesfrom every body, his own confidence and selfcontrol came swiftly back to him. 
Keep your eyes closed until you're quite sure you can take it,' he called. 'The view isoverwhelming. 
From each, a broad fan of light was aimed across the central axis, to shine upon the far side of the world. 
But now something was happen ing that could not be explained by the action of natural forces. 
Bits of the jigsaw puzzle were beginning to fall into place, though many were still missing. 
'Wait,' he said to himself, 'until the Rama Committee hears about this!' 
The Trade Winds of this cyl indrical world were beginning to etch their patterns in its sky; the first tropical storm in unknown ages was about to break. 
Mr Ambassador, you still have the floor.' 
To most people, Mercury was a fairly good approxi mation of Hell; at least, it would do until something worse came along. 
By comparison, the Moon and Mars had been almost tri vial challenges. 
And these treasures were in the best possible place, where the power of the Sun was ten times greater than on frigid Earth. 
They were respected for their toughness and engi neering skills, and admired for the way in which they had conquered so fearsome a world. 
True, but there would seem little point in it. And where are the propellant tanks, the energy sources? 
His colleagues looked at him in alarm; then he made a sudden recovery, banged his fist on the table and shouted: 'Of course! 
But suppose Rama is able to propel itselfaccelerat ing so that the northern end is forward. The water in the Sea would tend to move back; the level at the south would riseperhaps hundreds of metres. 
A fiftieth of a gee? 
It may hatch at any moment.' 
All our available bandwidth is already clogged with data transmissions. 
It comes from the remote depths of space, aimed precisely at the solar systemsomething quite incredible, if it was a matter of pure chance. 
If this is not the Second Coming, it may be the Second Judgement; the story of Noah des cribes the first. 
Even if I don't agree with you all along the line, you may have hit on something important.' 
He thought he had solved the problem rather neatly; besides, just suppose that Boris was right. 
The locations of the three on this Northern continent were dearly defined by diffuse strips of light, but those on the far side of the Cylindrical Sea merged together into a continuous, glow ing band. 
But something was stirring; and Boris Rodrigo's phrase would do as well as any other. 
Odd; I've never known that to happen before. 
The climate inside Rama had improved dramatic ally during the last few days... 
The increased humidity was no problem; the startling rise in oxygen was much more difficult to explain. 
They continued the slide, reached the fourth level, and started on towards the fifth. 
They were half way down the fourth stairway before Myron called out: Now do you recognize it?' 
Doesn't it upset you, Prof?' 
Whyit's no longer so blue. I'd call it peagreen. What does that signify?' 
So that's where the oxygen's come from. 
CHAPTER TWENTYTWOTo Sail the Cylindrical Sea When they reached the foot of the stairway, they had an other shock. At first, it appeared that something had gone through the camp, overturning equipment, even collect ing smaller objects and carrying them away. 
No one doubted that the cityor what ever it might bewas the real heart of this world. 
We still don't have a name. Skipperwhat about it?' 
Now awaiting your instructions.' 
As soon as stores can be loaded aboard, and the Har bour Master gives us clearance.' 
Then we leave at dawn.' 
They no longer made the nervous jokes that had punctuated the start of the voyage; this new experience was too overwhelming. 
Every spoonful con tained thousands of spherical, singlecelled microorgan isms, similar to the earliest forms of plankton that had existed in the oceans of Earth. 
It was now strikingly appar ent that the 'city', like so much of Rama, was triplicated; it consisted of three identical, circular complexes or super structures, rising from a long, oval foundation. 
Photo graphs taken from the Hub also indicated that each com plex was itself divided into three equal components, like a pie sliced into 120degree portions. 
This would greatly simplify the task of exploration; presumably they had to examine only one ninth of New York to have seen the whole of it. 
The Ramans, it seemed, had brought the art of triple redundancy to a high degree of perfection. 
This was demonstrated in the airlock system, the stairways at the Hub, the artificial suns. 
But once again Rama was forcing him to break some of his cherished rules. 
Nearly at the top,' he reported, speaking for the record and for his intently listening secondincommand, five kilometres away, 'still completely quietradiation nor mal. 
Then he waved to his companions and radioed back across the Sea: 'No sign of any activityeverything quiet. 
Luckily, it was impossible to lose one's bearings inside Rama; a single glance at the sky was enough to establish the northsouth axis of the world. They paused at almost every intersection to make a panoramic scan. 
They'd run out of fuel before they could go ten kilo metres.' 
I have friends on Mars who've been working on it, in secret. 
Yeseasily. 
Response good, stability poor. 
We'll be better off a kilometre lower down.' 
It would be an accelerating process, which could end in catastrophe. 
He finally halted a Jew metres above his waiting colleagues and realized, a little belatedly, that he was not quite sure how to land this gossamer craft. 
Only at this altitude. Hey, what do you want the blood for?' 
Sugar level; then I can tell how much energy you've used. 
I don't want to raise false hopesbut I think you can make it.' 
If he came down in the Sea, he would probably drown, quite unpleasantly, in its poisonous waters. 
A few wellplaced pecks could destroy Dragonfly's aerodynamics. 
In five minutes, he would be over New York; already the island looked rather like a ship, sailing for ever round and round the Cylindrical Sea. 
I'm finejust a little fatigue, but no more than I expected. 
Or, inverting the point of view, the spires of some Cambodian temple, set at the bottom of a crater... 
Three kilometres from the axisthat's slightly above lunar gravity. 
Big Horn now towered a kilometre above him, and the six spikes of the Little Horns were looming up all around. 
He could no longer land on Big Horn itself, for the gravity on its widening slopes was now too power ful to be counteracted by the feeble force of the sticky bomb. 
Nowhere in Rama had there been any trace of artistic expression; everything was purely func tional. 
When he went over to voice again he asked plaintively: 'What's happening? 
Hub Control was not much wiser, but at least it had a theory. 
Then you can tell when you're getting clear of the interference. Jimmy hastily jerked the stickybomb loose and aban doned his attempt to land. 
The band of the Cylindrical Sea was a wide and menacing barrier, waiting to swallow him up if, like Icarus, his fragile wings should fail. 
He was also cheered by the thought that the homeward trip could be twenty kilometres shorter than the outward one, for as long as he cleared the Sea, he could make an emergency landing anywhere in the northern continent. 
In all the utterly alien yet now familiar landscape, he could find no cause for his discom fort. 
It was then that he noticed that every individual hair was standing straight upright. 
Never before in his life had he been in real physical danger. 
His best move would be to get as far as possible from this dangerous structure, and to seek clear air. 
In fact, it might be only a trivial leakage of energy from some hidden source, deep in the southern cap of Rama. 
The turbulence was still increasing. It almost felt as if he was entering a jet streamwhich he had once done, in search of a record, while flying a highaltitude glider on Earth. But what could possibly create a jet stream inside Rama? 
Then he remembered that he was still thinking in terrestrial terms; though he was a good swim mer, it would be hours before he could possibly be res cued, and in that time the poisonous waters would un doubtedly have killed him. 
The few kilo grammes of thrust he could still provide might make all the difference between life and death; that was his only hope. 
The streamers of lightning still played from the tip of Big Horn down to the lesser peaks beneath, but now the whole pattern was rotating. 
Much of this region was a checkerboard of totally conflicting environments, as if a mad landscape gardener had been given a free hand and told to exercise his imagination to the utmost. 
Indeed, he felt very little fear, and this surprised him, for he had never thought of himself as a particularly brave man. 
It was almost as if he was watching the strug gles of a complete stranger, and was not himself person ally involved. 
It seemed altogether unfair and unreasonable that the sky should be so hard. 
CHAPTER TWENTYNINEFirst Contact When Jimmy Pak returned to consciousness, the first thing he became aware of was a splitting headache. 
From this greater distance, the thing did not appear quite so formidable. 
It had a low, flat body about two metres long and one wide, supported on six triplejointed legs. 
Take a look at this.' 
They were quite expressionless and of a startlingly vivid blue. 
He had been tempted to answer 'Why not?', but had thought better of it. 
Here, the curve of the world did not hideit revealed. 
All had been named after promi nent lunar craters, and he was approaching Copernicus. 
Am I going to get the same treatment? he wondered. He hoped the camera was not too unsteady as he showed Hub Control the rapidly ap proaching monster. 
He would be the first man to check them in practice. 
He walked back to the rim of Copernicus, and stared down into its opaque waters. 
At the rate it was going, Jimmy decided, it would take almost an hour to get here; if it was a threat, it was a very slowmoving one. 
With the contents of his flask, he could probably survive a weekbut for what purpose? 
Nevertheless, it was foolishand unmanlyto give up without a struggle. 
No one else would ever observe and photograph the varied ter rain through which he must pass, and that would guaran tee a posthumous immortality. 
Jimmy could see them all, spread out on the great curving map that swept up and away from him on either side. 
It was probably this thought that triggered Jimmy's footsteps. 
Even a doomed man might reasonably be expected to take some slight interest in a few thousand square metres of gems. 
The adjacent square of the checkerboard was rather more interesting, being covered with an ap parently random pattern of hollow metal columns, set very close together and ranging in height from less than one to more than five metres. 
After staring for some time, Jimmy decided that the only thing that made sense about the arrangement was for the floor down there to be an elevator. 
And there was one so utterly black that he could not even see it clearly; only the sense of touch told him that anything was there. 
The great fields were virgin, lifelesswaiting for crops that had never been planted. 
Further inland were other fields, and on many of them were complicated constructions of rods and wires, pre sumably intended for the support of climbing plants. 
Jimmy never knew what made him stop and look more closely into the metal maze to the south. 
He wondered if the likeness to terrestrial flowers might be a pure coincidence; perhaps this was something more akin to a coral polyp. 
Jimmy was a man of action and impulse, not of intro spection. 
Perhaps it was the only flower that grew in the whole of Rama; was he justified in picking it? 
Even before Jimmy had set off for the South Pole, he had been considering ways of rescuing him in the event of accident; the problem, however, had turned out to be so difficult that he had found no answer. All that he had managed to do was to eliminate every obvious solution. 
Then there was more advanced technology. 
The EVA propulsion units were tempting, but their thrust was too small, since they were designed for zerogee operation. 
There were, the engineer pointed out, severe stab ility problems; they might be solved, but it would take a long timemuch longer than they could afford. 
He handed the message to Karl Mercer. What do you think of this?' he asked, in as noncom mittal a tone of voice as he could manage. 
He would enter the water as cleanly as a falling spear... 
With all his strength, he started to swim upwards to wards the fading light. 
In a dead calmon a flat sea?' protested Sergeant Barnes, who seemed to regard Jimmy's plight as a direct reflection on her skill. 
It was a spectacle more aweinspiring than any they had yet seen here, and it brought with it a distant crack ling roar which added to the impression of overwhelm ing power. 
The display lasted for about five minutes; then it stopped as abruptly as if someone had turned a switch. 
He saw nothing, until his gaze had almost reached the zenith, and he was staring at the other side of the world. 
A tidal wave was racing towards them, down the eter nal curve of the Cylindrical Sea. 
All OK, Skipper,' was the reassuring answer from the Exec. 
The wave was still about ten kilometres away, and stretched the full width of the Sea from northern to southern shore. 
I hope so, but I want to study the situation.' 
Suddenly, in the very centre of the Sea, a line of breakers appeared. 
There must be a complex pattern of them all around the Sea, to damp out any waves as quickly as possible. 
She brought Resolution to a full stop and threw out the an chor. 
The Sergeant was headed full speed towards the wave, which was now only five kilometres away. For the first time, he could hear the sound of its approacha distant, unmistak able roar which he had never expected to hear inside Rama. 
'But I'll keep the motor running.' 
'But if we have to jump, wait until I tell you. 
The shock was therefore all the greater when, not more than a hundred metres away, something like a slowly ro tating wheel began to rear up out of the water. 
CHAPTER THIRTYTHREESpider From now on, Norton had decreed, there would always be at least three people at Camp Alpha, and one of them would always be awake. 
Potentially dangerous creatures were on the move inside Rama, and though none had shown active hostility, a prudent commander would take no chances. 
The territory round any group of explorers was to be kept under regular ob servation; in this way, it was hoped to eliminate any pos sibility of surprise. 
Norton turned his head. 
And he was not sure, but it also seemed to him that every few steps' it reversed its direction of spin, while the three whips flickered over the ground like lightning as it moved. 
Its top speedthough this also was very hard to estimatewas at least thirty kilometres an hour. 
It swept swiftly round the camp, examining every item of equipment, delicately touching the improvised beds and chairs and tables, communication gear, food con tainers, Electrosans, cameras, water tanks, toolsthere seemed to be nothing that it ignored, except the four watchers. 
Shall we try to catch it?' 
'But even if it worked, we can't risk it. 
Appears harmless but inquisitive. 
You won't believe this, Skipper. 
I want a report at every halfhour through the night. 
Through the telescope, it could be seen that the southern continent was also in fested with thembut not, it seemed, the island of New York. 
His Excellency had regretted that urgent and unavoidable business had kept him from attending the meeting, either in per son or by video. 
Dr Bose found it very hard to think of anything more urgentor more importantthan Ram a. 
There was a rustle of excitement among the other scien tists on the Committee. 
This must have involved an enormous amount of energy; the discharges which nearly cost Mrer Pak his life were merely a minor byproductperhaps a nuisance that had to be minimized by those giant lightning conductors at the South Pole. 
I'd like to comment on that,' said the science historian. 
Very wellif there are no other commentsI know that Dr Perera has some important information.' 
The spider is definitely organic, though its chemistry differs from ours in many respectsit contains consider able quantities of light metals. 
Also no air intakes, no lungs, no blood, no reproductive system... 
There's a brainfairly complex, mostly concerned with the creature's remarkably devel oped triocular vision. 
Its behaviour certainly fits that description. 
That's all they can do ... 
I assume that they are also electrically powered since, like the spider, they appear to have no mouths. 
Norton was instantly awake. 
Recorder off?' 
It's not really urgent Skipperan hour won't make any difference. 
I'm going myself; I'll call you when I reach the Hub.' 
For one hour, at the most. 
But now life, with all its infinite possibilities, had come to Rama. 
They had been replaced by a whole menagerie of much more impressive creatures; it had been no minor task, thinking of suitable names for them. 
Presumably, Rama, like any ship, required testing, checking and repairing after its immense voyage. 
It was as familiar to him as the Colorado mountains of his youth. 
When Jerry Kirchoff emerged from Airlock Alpha, Pieter knew at once that something unusual was happen ing. 
You're good at this Pieter. 
Pieter hefted the can, then said, 'I hope you've put enough mass inside itsometimes they get stuck on the first terrace.' 
Everyone was waiting, with nervous impatience, to see what Mercury would do next. 
The psychological pressures of that ravening star so close at hand, the engineering problems of tearing into a stub born planet and wrenching from it all the necessities of lifethese had produced a spartan and in many ways highly admirable culture. 
Here it comes.' Admiral Hendrix sounded calm and matteroffact, as if he was issuing a routine fleet order, instead of handling a situation unique in the history of space. 
But then, he was not ten kilometres from the bomb. 
CinC to Commander, Endeavour. 
Our experts also estimate that this would be the min imum size necessary to assure destruction of Rama. 
The United planets had only seven; and that was sometimes bad enough. 
The list contained numerous omissions and ambigui ties which presumably the future would rectify. 
But no one lived on the Gas Giants, and quite possibly no one ever would. 
He represented Uranus and its eight moons (none yet occu pied); Neptune and its other three satellites; Pluto and its solitary moon; and lonely, moonless Persephone. 
There seems general agreement, among those who have studied the matter, that no living organism of any complexity can survive more than a very few centuries of suspended animation. 
Rama has now given proof that its propulsion system is still operating. 
It could even become a satellite of a major planet such as Earth ... 
We are therefore, fellow delegates, faced with a whole spectrum of possibilities, some of them very serious in deed. 
It is foolish to pretend that these creatures must be benevolent and will not interfere with us in any way. 
If they come to our solar system, they need something from it. 
On Mercury we are perhaps unlucky in having no in digenous lifeforms to observe. 
And although we do not know if Rama has a queen, I suggest that the island known as New York serves a similar function. Now, it would obviously be absurd to press this anal ogy too far; it breaks down at many points. 
When there is no conflict of interest, we tolerate each other. 
We consider that we are acting not only for ourselves, but for the whole human race. 
That is all, Mister President, fellow delegates. 
But not Boris Rodrigo. 
Now, in the heart of his crowded, busy ship, he was com pletely aloneexcept for the portrait of Captain James Cook, gazing at him down the corridors of time. 
There was a story he had heard somewhere about a President of the United Stateswas it Roosevelt or Perez?who had a sign on his desk saying 'The buck stops here'. 
And the plan was flawless. 
But at least weeks of time would have been bought; Rama would be far past perihelion before another missile could possibly reach it. 
By then, hope fully, the worst fears of the alarmists might have been disproved. Or the reverse... 
To act, or not to actthat was the question. 
It might be some time before he would experience it again. CHAPTER FORTYSaboteur The scooter had been stripped of all unnecessary equip ment; it was now merely an open framework holding to gether propulsion, guidance and lifesupport systems. 
He took his time, flying over the polar plain. 
Yet it was im possible to judge Rama's size, since it was completely smooth and featurelessso featureless, indeed, that it was difficult to tell that it was spinning. 
It was lucky for him that solar activity was low. 
The bomb was a cylinder about ten metres long and three in diameterby a strange coincidence, almost the same proportions as Rama itself. 
For some reason, probably to do with the location of the centre of mass, it was supported at right angles to the axis of the carrier, so that it conveyed an appropriately sinister hammerhead impression. 
From each end of the bomb, a bundle of braided cables ran along the cylindrical side and disappeared through the latticework into the interior of the vehicle. 
But that would achieve nothingexcept perhaps to test the will and nerve of the Hermians. 
It seemed an unlikely explanation; such sensitivity would have been uncharacteristic. 
He would have to wait it out; there was still plenty of timea full fifty minutes. 
He would ignore the message completely, and see what the Hermians did next. 
Rodrigo's first sensation, when the bomb started to move, was not one of physical fear; it was something much more devastating. 
And they had obviously waited until a reply from Endeavour could have reached them before calling him again. 
On Mercury, they would now be seeing him heading pur posefully towards the bomb, and less than two kilometres away from it. 
But my conscience is clear; I'm sure we did the right thing. 
The hull's already developing dangerous hot spots and we've had to put out some local screening. 
I'm still waiting to hear if a tanker can rendezvous with us in time to get back to Earth, or whether we'll have to make planetfall at Mars. 
There were dozens of them, all different. 
Handtools (though for huge and peculiar hands), con tainers, small machines with keyboards that appeared to have been made for more than five fingers, scientific in struments, startlingly conventional domestic utensils, in cluding knives and plates which apart from their size would not have attracted a second glance on any terres trial table ... they were all there, with hundreds of less identifiable objects, often jumbled up together in the same pillar. 
He thought of the wild juxtaposi tions that any dictionary or alphabetized list will give, and tried the idea on his companions. 
This was an astonishing piece of luck, Norton told himself, though he felt that he had earned it; they could not possibly have made a better choice than this Illustrated Catalogue of Raman Artifacts. 
Probably not. 
We design robots in our own image; we might expect the Ramans to do the same.' 
It happened so slowly,' he explained apologetically, that it was a long time before I noticed any difference. 
Yes, Skippervery small shock. 
For there was now no doubt that the light was fail ing, and failing fast. 
Though they were all equipped with flashlights, the thought of darkness here was now intolerable; they had grown so psychologically accustomed to the endless day that it was hard to remember the conditions under which they had first explored this world. 
Dr Perera's calculations had been most convincing; Rama could not possibly accelerate at more than a fiftieth of a gravity, or the Cylindrical Sea would climb the southern cliff and flood an entire continent. 
It was absurd to imagine that all these trillions of tons could suddenly start moving with sufficient acceleration to shake him loose. 
Rama's manoeuvring was having some effect, but a very slight one. 
His overstrained legs and arms were trembling so uncontrollably that he was almost unable to help him self, and he was content to be handled like a halfpara lysed invalid. 
As the door of the inner airlock shut off the view for ever, he found him self thinking: 'How strange that night should be falling, now that Rama is closest to the sun!' 
Rama's protective cone of darkness might disappear at any moment, and he intended to make as much use of it as he could. 
There were no messages from Mercury, and the UP General Assembly had adjourned its session, though it was ready to meet again at an hour's notice. 
Rama was now foreshortened into a stubby cylinder, and the searing rim of the sun had peeked over one edge. 
Norton jockeyed Endeavour gently back into the umbra of the artificial eclipse, and saw the pearly splendour of the corona reappear across a background of the brighter stars. 
Either the universe, in a reversion of preCopernican cosmology, had suddenly decided to re volve around Endeavour; or the stars were standing still, and the ship was turning. 
The second explanation seemed rather more likely, yet it involved apparently insoluble paradoxes. 
Only one answer remained. 
As its distance grew, the anomalous be haviour of the ship slowly ceased; the normal laws of in ertia started to operate again. 
As to the nature of that drive, one thing was now cer tain, even though all else was mystery. 
Only a handful of comets had ever passed as close to the sun; at perihelion, it would be less than half a million kilometres above that inferno of fus ing hydrogen. 
In its place was a brilliant, star like object, showing no visible discas if Rama had sud denly contracted into a tiny ball. 
Some news for you, Bill. 
I wanted to give it first, before the crew gets into the act. 
Though interplanetary crises come and go, the wheels of Martian bureaucracy grind steadily away. 
Light was dawning. 
I hope he hasn't minded the wait.' Like every astronaut, Norton had been sterilized when he entered the service; for a man who would spend years in space, radiationinduced mutation was not a riskit was a certainty. 
Norton wondered if he would be home in time for the birth. He had earned rest, relaxationsuch normal fam ily life as an astronaut could ever know. 
Not about us. About Rama. I'm beginning to miss it.' 
But seriouslywell, more seriously I do feel a sense of loss.' 
One might speculate endlessly, but the nature and the purpose of the Ramans was still utterly unknown. 
They would probably never even know that the human race existed; such monu mental indifference was worse than any deliberate insult. 
"Pass the frying pan." 
Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes. 
All Harry's spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and topoftheline Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. 
What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because he hadn't practiced all summer? 
Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. 
This scar was the only hint of Harry's very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys' doorstep eleven years before. 
And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the whole story had come out. 
"They'll love him!" cried Aunt Petunia rapturously. 
Do tell me where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason ...... 
With any luck, I'll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten. be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time to morrow. 
He gazed miserably into the hedge. 
They, however, didn't seem to be missing him at all. 
He'd almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn't all been a dream .... 
"Today's your birthday," sneered Dudley. 
Haven't you even got friends at that freak place?" 
Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face. 
"ErI don't want to be rude or anything, butthis isn't a great time for me to have a houseelf in my bedroom." 
Aunt Petunias high, false laugh sounded from the living room. 
"Not that I'm not pleased to meet you," said Harry quickly, "but, er, is there any particular reason you're here?" 
Dobby wonders where to begin ...." 
"Sit down," said Harry politely, pointing at the bed. 
Harry hissed, springing up and pulling Dobby back onto the bedHedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage. 
"Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir ...." 
DOBBY'S is a houseelfbound to serve one house and one family forever ...... 
Dobby is always having to punish himself for something, sir. 
Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, "Whatever you've heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. 
"Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over HeWhoMustNotBeNamed" "Voldemort?" said Harry. 
"But I've got to go backterm starts on September first. 
"Notnot HeWhoMustNotBeNamed, sir =' But Dobby's eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give Harry a hint. 
Harry, however, was completely lost. 
And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed, seized Harry's desk lamp, and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps. 
In the closet!" hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby in, shutting the door, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned. 
"Whatthedevilareyoudoing?" said Uncle Vernon through gritted teeth, his face horribly close to Harry's. 
He made a grab for the letters, but Dobby jumped out of reach. 
Ah, sir, this is a danger you must not face! 
It did not contain birthday greetings. 
The following morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry's window. 
He himself fitted a catflap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. 
Dobby might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were going, he'd probably starve to death anyway. 
The soup was stonecold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. 
Then he crossed the room to Hedwig's cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray. 
You had to hand it to them, thought Harry, as George took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock. 
At last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunk through Harry's room to the open window. 
The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat, grinning from ear to ear. 
"He was a big supporter of YouKnowWho." 
Fred twiddled the steering wheel. 
It was a nightmareDad was working overtime for weeks." 
"It's wonderful," said Harry happily, thinking of Privet Drive. 
They got out of the car. 
"Now, we'll go upstairs really quietly," said Fred, "and wait for Mum to call us for breakfast Then, Ron, you come bounding downstairs going, `Mum, look who turned up in the night!' and she'll be all pleased to see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car." 
The other three wheeled around. 
"You keep your mouth closed while you're eating!" Mrs. Weasley snapped. 
At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small, redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen, gave a small squeal, and ran out again. 
"Ginny," said Ron in an undertone to Harry. 
There was a big photograph on the front of a very goodIOI)king wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. 
He let go of the gnome's ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge. 
"Pitiful," said Fred. 
"They'll be back," said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field. 
Mrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. 
"Well, dear, I think you'll find that he would be quite within the law to do that, even iferhe maybe would have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth .... 
"Did you really?" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. 
"Did it go all right? 
It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in Ron's room seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the walls, even the ceiling. 
"Your Quidditch team?" said Harry. 
C H4 A P T E R V O U R AT F L 0 V RR 11 $ H AND BLOTTS ife at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive. 
Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, "Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!" 
For a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters. 
Harry's told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King's Cross station on September first. 
"That lot won't come cheap," said George, with a quick look at his parents. 
She nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put her elbow in the butter dish. 
"I'm very busy with schoolwork, of course'How can she be?" said Ron in horror. 
After you, Harry dear!" 
Harry stared at them all watching him. 
He took a deep breath, scattered the powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a warm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash. 
"What's the good of that if I'm not on the House team?" said Malfoy, looking sulky and badtempered. 
"The Ministry wouldn't presume to trouble you, sir, surely?" 
Mr. Malfoy's lip curled. 
The name Malfoy still commands a certain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. 
"Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder! 
Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine taste, sir." 
"I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin," said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, "No offense, sir, no offense meant" "Though if his grades don't pick up," said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still, "that may indeed be all he is fit for" "It's not my fault," retorted Draco. 
I'll expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods." 
An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails. 
"I told you, I was lostwhat were you doing down there, anyway?". 4 "I was lookin' fer a FleshEatin' Slug Repellent," growled Hagrid. 
"They're ruinin' the school cabbages. 
"I'm staying with the Weasleys but we got separated," Harry explained. 
Harry explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys. 
Harry and Hermione looked around: Sprinting up the crowded street were Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and Mr. Weasley. 
"Oh, Harryoh, my dearyou could have been any where" Gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid hadn't managed to beat away. 
And he strode away, head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street. 
He pointed excitedly at the tenpound notes in Mr. Granger's hand. 
He tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag. 
In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster's Fabulous WetStart, NoHeat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of bro ken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy, deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power. `A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers, " Ron read aloud off the back cover. 
The reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows: GILDEROY LOCKHART will be signing copies of his autobiography MAGICAL ME today 12:30 P. m. to 4:30 P. m. 
When he finally let go of Harry's hand, Harry could hardly feel his fingers. 
"He had no idea," Lockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose, "that he would shortly be getting much, much more than my book, Magical Me. 
Ginny went scarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both clutching stacks of Lockhart's books. 
He stood with his hand on Draco's shoulder, sneering in just the same way. 
"Busy time at the Ministry, I hear," said Mr. Malfoy. 
"The company you keep, Weasley ... and I thought your family could sink no lower =' There was a thud of metal as Ginny's cauldron went flying; Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him backward into a bookshelf. 
Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads; there was a yell of, "Get him, Dad!" from Fred or George; Mrs. Weasley was shrieking, "No, Arthur, no!"; the crowd stampeded backward, knocking more shelves over; "Gentlemen, pleaseplease!" cried the assistant, and then, louder than all "Break it up, there, gents, break it up" Hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books. 
"Yeh should've ignored him, Arthur," said Hagrid, almost lifting Mr. Weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes. 
The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barely came up to Hagrid's waist and seemed to think better of it. 
"A fine example to set for your children ... brawling in public ... what Gilderoy Lockhart must've thought" "He was pleased," said Fred. 
They said goodbye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side; Mr. Weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs. Weasley's face. 
They were up at dawn, but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do. 
He barely had time to wonder when he'd see it again when they were back George had forgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks. 
They had almost reached the highway when Ginny shrieked that she'd left her diary. 
"Molly, dear" "No, Arthur" "No one would seethis little button here is an Invisibility Booster I installedthat'd get us up in the airthen we fly above the clouds. 
"Lost control of the trolley," Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as he got up. 
"I don't understand why the gateway's sealed itself" Harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach. 
"It's gone," said Ron, sounding stunned. 
"Can't be much further, can it?" croaked Ron, hours later still, as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink. 
It was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds. 
The car wobbled again. 
Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc, soaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then out over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time. 
A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great Hall, but Snape led them away from the warmth and light, down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons. 
Mr. Angus Fleet, of Peebles, reported to police ... Six or seven Muggles in all. 
"Dear, dear ... his own son... " 
Harry felt as though he'd just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree's larger branches. 
"That tree did more damage to us than we" Ron blurted out. "Silence!" snapped Snape again. 
I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power. 
He stared down his very crooked nose at them, and 80 Harry suddenly found himself wishing he and Ron were still being beaten up by the Whomping Willow. 
He knew Dumbledore would see through this at once, but Dumbledore asked no questions about the car. 
He cleared his throat and said, "Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable treesurely acts of this nature". i "It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys' punishments, Severus," said Dumbledore calmly. 
"And speaking of Gryffindor" Professor McGonagall said sharply, but Harry cut in: "Professor, when we took the car, term hadn't started, soso Gryffindor shouldn't really have points taken from itshould it?" he finished, watching her anxiously. 
They entered the familiar, circular room, with its five fourposters hung with red velvet and its high, narrow windows. 
Harry couldn't help it. 
Things started to go downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling (today, a dull, cloudy gray). 
Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope. 
"ABSOLUTELYDISGUSTEDYOUR FATHER'S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME." 
Just calm down, all right? 
Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible. 
She gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder. 
By the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty, aching, and covered in earth. 
I'mI'm Colin Creevey," he said breathlessly, taking a tentative step forward. 
I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts. 
"Signed photos? 
I don't want a foul scar right across my head, thanks. 
We meet again, Harry!" 
"I covered up for you back there with young Creeveyif he was photographing me, too, your schoolmates won't think you're setting yourself up so much ...." 
Deaf to Harry's stammers, Lockhart swept him down a corridor lined with staring students and up a staircase. 
They had reached Lockhart's classroom and he let Harry go at last. 
He reached forward, picked up Neville Longbottom's copy of Travels with Trolls, and held it up to show his own, winking portrait on the front. 
Nothing to worry about just to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in" When he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said, "You have thirty minutesstartnow!" 
Half an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class. 
"I must ask you not to scream," said Lockhart in a low voice. 
"Freshly caught Cornish pixies. " 
"Well, they're notthey're not verydangerous, are they?" Seamus choked. 
"Don't be so sure!" said Lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly at Seamus. 
"Right, then," Lockhart said loudly. 
It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window, too. 
There was a thin mist hanging across the pinkandgold sky. 
He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the moment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. 
"You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren't you, Harry? 
"Well, the Quafethat's the biggish red oneis the one that scores goals. 
As Wood launched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley's head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet's shoulder and he began to snore. 
"We should have won the Quidditch cup last year. 
Wood took a moment to regain control of himself. 
"And the Slytherins don't need a spy, Oliver," said George. 
"But I've got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape. `I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker." 
"Aren't you Lucius Malfoy's son?" said Fred, looking at Malfoy with dislike. 
111 "What's happening?" Ron asked Harry. 
"Good, aren't they?" said Malfoy smoothly. 
The smug look on Malfoy's face flickered. 
Ron opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. 
"We'd better get him to Hagrid's, it's nearest," said Harry to Hermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron up by the arms. 
Is he ill? 
Ron gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down his front. 
"What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?" Harry asked, scratching Fang's ears. 
Hermione, however, said in a voice somewhat higher than usual, "I think you're being a bit unfair. 
There are 115 some wizardslike Malfoy's familywho think they're better than everyone else because they're what people call pureblood." 
"It's a disgusting thing to call someone," said Ron, wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand. 
Least yer not in trouble." 
How come I haven't got one?" 
"If Lockhart's still spreading that around". 16 But then he saw that Hagrid was laughing. 
Yer more famous than him without tryin'." 
"Come and see what I've bin growin'," said Hagrid as Harry and Hermione finished the last of their tea. 
"What've you been feeding them?" said Harry. 
"That's what yer little sister said," said Hagrid, nodding at Ron. 
"Met her jus' yesterday." 
There must be about a hundred cups in that room. 
He gritted his teeth and knocked. 
"What?" he said loudly. 
"Thatthat voice that saiddidn't you hear it?" 
"I know," said Harry, lying back in his fourposter and staring at the canopy above him. 
Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid's pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. 
"Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! 
Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far calmer tone, "Sowhat's bothering you? 
He looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of lamplike yellow eyes. 
"Filch isn't in a good moodhe's got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. 
"Filth!" he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry's Quidditch robes. 
The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place. 
Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves. 
And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flatfooted from the office, Mrs. Norris streaking alongside him. 
Hopefully, whatever Peeves had done (and it sounded as though he'd wrecked something very big this time) would distract Filch from Harry. 
Nearly Headless Nick, Harry noticed, was still holding Sir Patrick's rejection letter.. 
"I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt," Harry said. 
Friends will be coming from all over the country. 
Rain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful. 
Fred had "rescued" the brilliant orange, firedwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people. 
"Hello, Peeves," said Harry cautiously. 
Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent. 
He took a deep breath and bellowed, "OY! 
"Nohonestlydidn't I just say how nice Myrtle's looking?" said Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs. 
It's nearly time for my speech, I'd better go and warn the orchestra...." 
"Oh, here we go," said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly. 
The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearing and plunging. At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm, from which position he was blowing the horn. 
"How are you? 
But I mean to saylook at the fellow" "I think," said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, "Nick's veryfrightening ander" "Ha!" yelled Sir Patrick's head. 
"My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow ..." 
But nobody heard much more. 
Harry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry. 
"Let's go," Harry agreed. 
"It's that voice againshut up a minute" "... soo hungry ... for so long ..." 
His stomach lurched"It's going to kill someone!" he shouted, and ignoring Ron's and Hermione's bewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen over his own pounding footstepsHarry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermione panting behind him, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last, deserted passage. 
Foothigh words had been daubed on the wall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches. the chamber of secrets has been opened. enemies of the heir, beware. 
"What's that thinghanging underneath?" said Ron, a slight quiver in his voice. 
As they edged nearer, Harry almost slippedthere was a large puddle of water on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him, and they inched toward the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. 
She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring. 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight. 
"You!"he screeched. 
You've murdered my cat! 
The photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding in agreement as he talked. 
"Really, Severus," said Professor McGonagall sharply, "I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. 
"I want to see some punishment!" 
I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep" "Excuse me," said Snape icily. 
When they were a floor up from Lockhart's office, they turned into 144 an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them. 
"I know it's weird," said Harry. 
"You know, it rings a sort of bell," said Ron slowly. 
When Filch wasn't guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking redeyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like "breathing loudly" and "looking happy". 
According to Ron, she was a great cat lover. "But you haven't really got to know Mrs. Norris," Ron told her bracingly. 
I'm only joking" Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched. 
Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks. 
Professor Binns, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard. 
Professor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lec 148 ture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed. 
Dean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown's head came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom's elbow slipped off his desk. 
"Please, sir, don't legends always have a basis in fact?" 
He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Harry 149 could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest. 
There was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him, hoping for more. 
"There is no Chamber and no monster." 
"Can't hurt to have a poke around," said Harry, dropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along, searching for clues. 
"Hereand here" "Come and look at this!" said Hermione. 
Hermione was pointing at the topmost pane, where around twenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a small crack. 
He looked over his shoulder. 
"What's the matter?" said Harry. 
"That's Moaning Myrtle's place. 
It was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set foot in. 
"Nothing," said Harry quickly. 
"I wasn't paying attention," said Myrtle dramatically. 
Harry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but Hermione shrugged wearily and said, "Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle .... 
"Just having a look around," Ron shrugged. 
To Harry's surprise, Hermione followed suit. 
"If you're talking about Malfoy" "Of course I am!" said Ron. 
"You heard him`You'll be next, Mudbloods!'come on, you've only got to look at his foul rat face to know it's him" "Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?" said Hermione skeptically. 
"But how do we prove it?" said Harry darkly. 
We'd be breaking about fifty school rules, I expect" "If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won't you?" said Ron irritably. 
"They'd have to be really thick ...." 
C HH A P T V It T 1' N THE ROGUE BLUDGER ince the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor Lockhart had not brought live creatures to class. 
"Here it is," said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed The Polyjuice Potion. 
What're we going to do, break into Snape's private stores? 
There were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual. 
Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying, Harry, because we've got to win today, we've got to." 
"So no pressure, Harry" said Fred, winking at him. 
"On my whistle," said Madam Hooch. "Three ... two ... one... 
He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him. 
Over her shoulder, Harry could see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction. 
Let's ask for an inquiry)) "If we stop now, we'll have to forfeit the match!" said Harry. 
"Ready to resume play?" she asked Wood. 
"Training for the ballet, Potter?" yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at Malfoy in hatred, he saw itthe Golden Snitch. 
And he fainted. 
He came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, with someone leaning over him. 
"I'll keep it like this, thanks ...... 
But the point is, the bones are no longer broken. 
Hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry's bed while Ron helped him into his pajamas. 
"But it doesn't do anything else either." 
Filthy and soaking wet, the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see Harry. 
A single tear was running down his long, pointed nose. 
"It was you!" he said slowly. 
"Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Dobby," stammered the elf, his eyes huge in the dark. 
Harry Potter must not meddle in this, sir, 'tis too dangerous" "Who is it, Dobby?" 
"Dobby must go!" breathed the elf, terrified. There was a loud crack, and Harry's fist was suddenly clenched on thin air. 
He was carrying one end of what looked like a statue. 
His eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up in front of him, holding his camera. 
"Good gracious!" said Madam Pomfrey. 
Seeing that he was awake, Madam Pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers. 
An old cauldron was perched on the toilet, and a crackling from under the rim told Harry they had lit a fire beneath it. 
That's why we decided we'd better get going" "The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the better," snarled Ron. 
He was in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match, he took it out on Colin." 
Hermione and Ron listened with their mouths open. 
I want to know how come nobody's noticed it sneaking around the school." 
The air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion. 
"And everyone knows I'm almost a Squib." 
Knowing he had only seconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it landed right on target in Goyle's cauldron. 
People shrieked as splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. 
Through the confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape's office. 
Hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir feverishly. 
"As long as it's not" Harry began, but he ended on a groan: Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than Snape, wearing his usual black. 
Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course." 
There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to sprawl on the floor. 
Possibly Lockhart had noticed, because he said, "Enough demonstrating! 
"Face your partners!" called Lockhart, back on the platform. 
He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted, "Rictusempra!" 
Stop!" screamed Lockhart, but Snape took charge. 
"What, drop my wand?" 
He brandished his wand at the snake and there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. 
All he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake, "Leave him alone!" 
And miraculouslyinexplicablythe snake slumped to the floor, docile as a thick, black garden hose, its eyes now on Harry. 
He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls. 
As they went through the doors, the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something. 
"I mean, that's only the second time I've ever done it. 
You were thereyou heard me" "I heard you speaking Parseltongue," said Ron. 
"And now the whole school's going to think you're his greatgreatgreatgreatgrandson or something" "But I'm not," said Harry, with a panic he couldn't quite explain. 
IL96 Harry lay awake for hours that night. 
The words wouldn't come. 
Resisting the urge to take a look, Harry walked on by, thinking that Justin might be using his free time to catch up on some work, and deciding to check the library first. 
I mean to say, he was only a baby when it happened. 
They all looked fearfully at Ernie. 
"Why aren't yeh in class?" 
"What're you doing in here?" 
"Second one killed this term," he explained. 
Yeh look all hot and bothered" Harry couldn't bring himself to repeat what Ernie and the rest of the Hufflepuffs had been saying about him. 
This must be where Dumbledore lived. 
"Er, yes," Harry muttered. 
"Yes ... you were particularly difficult to place. 
Harry backed away, watching it. 
The office door opened. 
Dumbledore came in, looking very somber. 
"It's a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day," said Dumbledore, seating himself behind his desk. 
Ginny didn't find it amusing either. 
But their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it. 
"Not for long," said Hermione in a satisfied tone. 
We'll be getting the truth out of him any day now." 
At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle. 
Percy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior, didn't spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. 
"Positive," said Hermione, shifting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron's fourposter. 
"And obviously, it'll be best if you can get something of Crabbe's and Goyle's; they're Malfoys best friends, he'll tell them anything. 
"The potion will be useless without Crabbe's and Goyle's hair," she said sternly. 
"Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club? 
And she's gone home for Christmasso I'll just have to tell the Slytherins I've decided to come back." 
For a moment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on their faces. 
Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both keeled over backward onto the floor. 
They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shinyfaced and looking anxious. 
"We'd better not all drink them in here .... Once we turn into Crabbe and Goyle we won't fit. 
And Millicent Bulstrode's no pixie. 
Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the middle stall. 
"Ready," came Ron's and Hermione's voices. 
His large hand trembling, he pulled off his old robes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on the spare ones, and laced up Goyle's boatlike shoes. 
You two hurry up, you re wasting time Harry looked at Ron, bewildered. 
"We'll meet you back here, all right?" he said. 
"Don't swing your arms like that," Harry muttered to Ron. 
The labyrinthine passages were deserted. 
It wasn't a Slytherin, it was Percy. 
The Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps were hanging on chains. 
It had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet, and it said: INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car. 
"He's another one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn't go around with that jumped up Granger Mudblood. 
Of course, he's got a lot on his plate at the moment. 
His nose was also slowly lengtheningtheir hour was up, Ron was turning back into himself, and from the look of horror he was suddenly giving Harry, he must be, too. 
"Have you still got Millicent's nose or something?" 
They poked their heads around the corner. 
"It's over there, it got washed out ...... 
It had a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom. 
Harry stepped forward to pick it up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back. 
"Come off it, how could it be dangerous?" 
T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago." 
If you'd wiped slime off a name for an hour, you'd remember it, too." 
Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London. 
"Well, it's not much use to you," said Ron. 
"That's what Malfoy said." 
"Yeah..." said Ron slowly. 
There's nothing written in his diary." 
She tapped the diary three times and said, "Aparecium!" 
The sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again. 
"And after that, it won't be long until we're cutting them up and stewing them. 
"You know, what the school needs now is a moralebooster. 
Lockhart's idea of a moralebooster became clear at breakfast time on February fourteenth. 
Lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was waving for silence. 
"Happy Valentine's Day!" Lockhart shouted. 
"My friendly, cardcarrying cupids!" beamed Lockhart. 
"Here is your singing valentine: His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad, His hair is as dark as a blackboard. 
"Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now," he said, shooing some of the younger students away. 
Ron, grinning broadly, caught it. 
In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one. 
A story was given out that thegirl had died in a freak accident. 
"Let me show you. " 
He knew immediately where he was. 
He continued to read, frowning slightly. 
Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, "ErI'll just go, shall I?" 
"Ah, Riddle," said the Headmaster. 
244 Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed. 
All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue. 
He heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden. 
"I'm going to have to turn you in, Rubeus. 
They're talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don't stop." 
From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking. 
The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered ...... 
And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone A vast, lowslung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razorsharp pincersRiddle raised his wand again, but he was too late. 
"There you are," he said. 
Harry sat up. 
"And the attacks must've stopped after Hagrid was kicked out. 
"He was buying a FleshEating Slug Repellent," said Harry quickly. 
"That'd be a cheerful visit," said Ron. 
In the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled. 
Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose. 
But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch. 
But his cheerful mood didn't last long. 
At the top of the stairs to the dormitory, he met Neville Longbottom, who was looking frantic. 
Hermione looked aghast at the news. 
"Perfect Quidditch conditions!" said Wood enthusiastically at the Gryffindor table, loading the team's plates with scrambled eggs. 
"We've got to playthe cup Gryffindor" Professor McGonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her megaphone: "All students are to make their way back to the House common rooms, where their Heads of Houses will give them further information. 
To Harry's surprise, Professor McGonagall didn't object. 
Some of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the match being canceled; others looked worried. 
Harry and Ron followed Professor McGonagall back into the school and up the marble staircase. 
No student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. 
"Haven't any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe? 
Isn't it obvious all this stuff's coming from Slytherin? 
Percy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but for once he didn't seem keen to make his views heard. 
"That Ravenclaw girlPenelope Clearwatershe's a prefect. 
Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid in because he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed. 
It was with relief that they reached the oak front doors and eased them open. 
It was a clear, starry night. 
Fang the boarhound barked loudly behind him. 
He kept glancing nervously at the windows. 
He dropped into one of his chairs and looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge. 
"You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir" "I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence," said Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge. 
Two more this afternoon, wasn't it? 
Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore's final words to himself "I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me... 
Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) by Ron. 
They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren't allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors. 
"Yeah, right," said Malfoy, smirking. 
"I'm quite surprised the Mudbloods haven't all packed their bags by now," Malfoy went on. 
"Bet you five Galleons the next one dies. 
"Looks like they're heading for the Forbidden Forest ...." 
And Ron looked even unhappier about that. 
At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. 
The culprit has been taken away" "Says who?" said Dean Thomas loudly. 
Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione. 
Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole. 
"There's something moving over there," Harry breathed. 
"It'll hear you." 
"Probably getting ready to pounce," said Ron. 
"Dunno" Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes. 
As Ron walked, openmouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him, exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner. 
Harry didn't even have time to turn around. 
Ron looked exactly like Harry felt. 
Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something. 
"But that was years ago," said Aragog fretfully. 
I come from a distant land. 
Hagrid 2Y is my good friend, and a good man. 
When I was discovered, and blamed for the death of a girl, he protected me. 
I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. 
Do you know what did kill that girl?" said Harry. 
Harry looked sideways at Ron. 
His mouth was still open in the silent scream, but his eyes weren't popping anymore. 
After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned, and Harry could again see patches of sky. 
They had reached the edge of the forest. 
At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash. 
"Ronthat girl who died. 
Professorr 28% McGonagall restored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned, frowning, to Seamus. 
There was an explosion of cheering. 
"It won't matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!" he said to Harry. 
Someone acting oddly?" 
I'm starving, I've only just come off patrol duty." 
"Go on, tell us, we won't laugh." 
"Mark my words," he said, ushering them around a corner. "The first words out of those poor Petrified people's mouths will be It was Hagrid.' 
I will inform Professor Binns where you've gone. 
"Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?" said Ron, looking sadly at Hermione's rigid face. 
It was a page torn from a very old library book. 
That why I've been hearing that voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it. 
Colin saw it through his camera. 
I bet you anything she warned the first person she met to look around corners with a mirror first! 
Harry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had scribbled at the foot of the page. 
All teach ers return to the staff room. 
"No," said Harry, glancing around. 
Professor Flitwick let out a squeal. 
"The Heir of Slytherin," said Professor McGonagall, who was very white, "left another message. 
"So sorrydozed offwhat have I missed?" 
"II really neveryou may have misunderstood" "We'll leave it to you, then, Gilderoy," said Professor McGonagall. 
Lockhart gazed desperately around him, but nobody came to the rescue. 
Percy wasn't there. 
No afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had Gryffindor Tower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet. 
Anything. "Harry" said Ron. "Do you think there's any chance at all she's notyou know =" Harry didn't know what to say. 
The Gryffindors around them were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that nobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room, and left through the portrait hole. 
"I'm rather busy at the momentif you would be quick" "Professor, we've got some information for you," said Harry. 
"We think it'll help you." 
"I meanwell all right" He opened the door and they entered. 
"Do use your common sense. 
If there's one thing I pride myself on, it's my Memory Charms. 
Only one thing left." 
"What do you want this time?" 
302 Very slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still see, Harry edged forward, his wand held high. 
The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green, lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor. 
"Blimey," said Ron weakly. 
Harry flung his arms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor. 
Harry knew there was only one thing to do. 
There was a very pregnant pause, "I'll try and shift some of this rock," said Ron, who seemed to be trying to keep his voice steady. 
And he set off alone past the giant snake skin. 
Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall. 
A tall, blackhaired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, watching. 
Harry stared at him. 
Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than sixteen. 
There's a basilisk ... 
"What do you mean, I won't be?" 
It's like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket .... 
It made the hairs stand up on the back of Harry's neck. 
There are rooster feathers all over my robes and 1 don't know how they got there. 
Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed .... 
For many months now, my new target has beenyou." 
There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now. 
"Voldemort," said Riddle softly, "is my past, present, and future, Harry Potter ...." 
He stared numbly at Riddle, at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry's own parents, and so many others .... 
At last he forced himself to,peak. 
"Not what?" snapped Riddle. 
"Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore. 
He was speaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle, wishing rather than believing it to be true Riddle opened his mouth, but froze. 
A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling. 
You're a wreck. 
Horrorstruck, Harry saw his mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole. 
"Help me, help me," Harry muttered wildly, "someoneanyone The snake's tail whipped across the floor again. 
It lunged again, and its forked tongue lashed Harry's side. 
Do you see what he's doing, Potter? 
If this is dying, thought Harry, it's not so bad. 
But was this dying? 
A pearly patch of tears was shining all around the woundexcept that there was no wound "Get away, bird," said Riddle's voice suddenly. 
"Get away from himI said, get away" Harry raised his head. 
Ink spurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over Harry's hands, flooding the floor. 
Harry's wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence. 
The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right through it. 
Him and the basilisk. 
Harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss. 
"He looks like he wants you to grab hold..." said Ron, looking perplexed. 
The chill air was whipping through Harry's hair, and before he'd stopped enjoying the ride, it was overall four of them were hitting the wet floor of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, and as Lockhart straightened his hat, the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place. 
"There's no need to sound so disappointed," he said grimly, wiping flecks of blood and slime off his glasses. 
She leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both of them flung themselves on their daughter. 
Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a moment, then walked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the rubyencrusted sword, and what remained of Riddle's diary. 
So Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told them about Fawkes's timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving him the sword. 
"Of course, he was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen." 
What have I always told you? 
"This has been a terrible ordeal for her. 
There will be no punishment. 
Surelysurelythey weren't about to be punished? 
"You will both receive Special Awards for Services to the School andlet me seeyes, I think two hundred points apiece for Gryffindor." 
"He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired," Ron explained quietly to Dumbledore. 
"Impaled upon your own sword, Gilderoy!" 
Not something he intended to do, I'm sure .... "Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?" Harry said, thunderstruck. 
"Listen to me, Harry. 
"Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. 
"We'll be needing a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher... 
The governors suspended you, but you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts." %$4 "Well, you see, Lucius," said Dumbledore, smiling serenely, "the other eleven governors contacted me today. 
Mr. Malfoy forced himself to speak. 
And Harry suddenly understood. 
"Because you gave it to her," said Harry. 
Lucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Harry distinctly saw his right hand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand. 
He turned to go. 
He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below. 
Well" "It was a clue, sir," said Dobby, his eyes widening, as though this was obvious. 
The Dark Lord, before he changed his name, could be freely named, you see?" 
And with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared. 
Harry didn't know whether the best bit was Hermione running toward him, screaming "You solved it! 
They made the most of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays. 
The Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped. 
Harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to Ron and Hermione. 
He was called My Lord" by all his people, and he never told a story but everyone laughed at it. 
It is demonstrable," said he, "that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for as all things have been created for some end, they must necessarily be created for the best end. 
She innocently took hold of his hand, and he as innocently kissed hers with a warmth, a sensibility, a graceall very particular; their lips met; their eyes sparkled; their knees trembled; their hands strayed. 
Yes, gentlemen, that is really my size," replied he, with a low bow. 
You are perfectly right, gentlemen," said Candide, "this is precisely the doctrine of Master Pangloss; and I am convinced that everything is for the best." 
One fine spring morning, he took it into his head to take a walk, and he marched straight forward, conceiving it to be a privilege of the human species, as well as of the brute creation, to make use of their legs how and when they pleased. 
A courtmartial sat upon him, and he was asked which he liked better, to run the gauntlet six and thirty times through the whole regiment, or to have his brains blown out with a dozen musketballs? 
His sores were now skimmed over and he was able to march, when the King of the Bulgarians gave battle to the King of the Abares. 
How Candide Escaped from the Bulgarians and What Befell Him Afterward Never was anything so gallant, so well accoutred, so brilliant, and so finely disposed as the two armies. 
The trumpets, fifes, hautboys, drums, and cannon made such harmony as never was heard in Hell itself. 
He next addressed himself to a person who had just come from haranguing a numerous assembly for a whole hour on the subject of charity. 
Hark ye, friend," said the orator, "do you hold the Pope to be Antichrist?" 
Alas!" said the one wretch to the other, "don't you know dear Pangloss?" 
Oh, Lord!" cried Pangloss, "I am so weak I cannot stand," upon which Candide instantly led him to the Anabaptist's stable, and procured him something to eat. 
Ah, where is the best of worlds now? 
But how could this beautiful cause produce in you so hideous an effect?" 
Is not the devil the root of it?" 
Not at all," replied the great man, "it was a thing unavoidable, a necessary ingredient in the best of worlds; for if Columbus had not caught in an island in America this disease, which contaminates the source of generation, and frequently impedes propagation itself, and is evidently opposed to the great end of nature, we should have had neither chocolate nor cochineal. 
The next day, in searching among the ruins, they found some eatables with which they repaired their exhausted strength. 
For," said he, "all this is for the very best end, for if there is a volcano at Lisbon it could be in no other spot; and it is impossible but things should be as they are, for everything is for the best." 
Your Excellency will be so good as to excuse me," said Pangloss, free will is consistent with absolute necessity; for it was necessary we should be free, for in that the will" Pangloss was in the midst of his proposition, when the familiar beckoned to his attendant to help him to a glass of port wine. 
How the Portuguese Made a Superb AutoDeFe to Prevent Any Future Earthquakes, and How Candide Underwent Public Flagellation After the earthquake, which had destroyed threefourths of the city of Lisbon, the sages of that country could think of no means more effectual to preserve the kingdom from utter ruin than to entertain the people with an autodafe, it having been decided by the University of Coimbra, that the burning of a few people alive by a slow fire, and with great ceremony, is an infallible preventive of earthquakes. 
Eight days afterwards they were each dressed in a sanbenito, and their heads were adorned with paper mitres. 
What return can I make you for this charitable assistance?" The good old beldame kept a profound silence. 
Candide thought himself in a trance; he looked upon his whole life, hitherto, as a frightful dream, and the present moment as a very agreeable one. 
She was of a majestic mien and stature, her dress was rich, and glittering with diamonds, and her face was covered with a veil. 
Do I find you again in Portugal? then you have not been ravished? they did not rip open your body, as the philosopher Pangloss informed me?" 
And how came you into Portugal? And how did you know of my being here? 
And how" I will tell you all," replied the lady, "but first you must acquaint me with all that has befallen you since the innocent kiss you gave me, and the rude kicking you received in consequence of it." 
"A Bulgarian captain came in, and saw me weltering in my blood, and the soldier still as busy as if no one had been present. 
This agreement has subsisted almost six months; but not without several contests, whether the space from Saturday night to Sunday morning belonged to the old or the new law. 
I must confess to you for a truth, that your skin is whiter and more blooming than that of the Bulgarian captain. 
Thus agitated and perplexed, now distracted and lost, now half dead with grief, I revolved in my mind the murder of my father, mother, and brother, committed before my eyes; the insolence of the rascally Bulgarian soldier; the wound he gave me in the groin; my servitude; my being a cookwench to my Bulgarian captain; my subjection to the hateful Jew, and my cruel Inquisitor; the hanging of Doctor Pangloss; the Miserere sung while you were being whipped; and particularly the kiss I gave you behind the screen, the last day I ever beheld you. 
Candide drew his rapier, and though he was very gentle and sweettempered, he laid the Israelite dead on the floor at the fair Cunegund's feet. 
Where shall I find Inquisitors and Jews who can give me more?" 
Candide, Cunegund, and the old woman, after passing through Lucina, Chellas, and Letrixa, arrived at length at Cadiz. 
Candide, having been in the Bulgarian service, performed the military exercise of that nation before the general of this little army with so intrepid an air, and with such agility and expedition, that he received the command of a company of foot. 
Being now made a captain, he embarked with Miss Cunegund, the old woman, two valets, and the two Andalusian horses, which had belonged to the Grand Inquisitor of Portugal. 
Such a prince! as handsome as myself, sweettempered, agreeable, witty, and in love with me over head and ears. 
As she had a very fine estate in the neighborhood of Gaeta, we embarked on board a galley, which was gilded like the high altar of St. Peter's, at Rome. 
I did not retain it long; this precious flower, which had been reserved for the lovely Prince of Massa Carrara, was cropped by the captain of the Moorish vessel, who was a hideous Negro, and thought he did me infinite honor. 
I witnessed on this occasion such a battle as you never beheld in your cold European climates. 
The captives, my companions, the Moors who took us, the soldiers, the sailors, the blacks, the whites, the mulattoes, and lastly, my captain himself, were all slain, and I remained alone expiring upon a heap of dead bodies. 
Our army made a great slaughter among the Russians; but they soon returned us the compliment. Azoff was taken by storm, and the enemy spared neither age, sex, nor condition, but put all to the sword, and laid the city in ashes. 
As soon as my companions were in a condition to walk, they were sent to Moscow. 
The air with which he made this demand alarmed Candide, who did not dare to say he was married to her, because indeed he was not; neither did he venture to say she was his sister, because she was not; and though a lie of this nature proved of great service to one of the ancients, and might possibly be useful to some of the moderns, yet the purity of his heart would not permit him to violate the truth. 
The flight of Cunegund and Candide was already the towntalk. 
You cannot run away," said she to Cunegund, "but you have nothing to fear; it was not you who killed My Lord Inquisitor: besides, as the Governor is in love with you, he will not suffer you to be illtreated; therefore stand your ground." 
He was the fourth part of a Spaniard, of a mongrel breed, and born in Tucuman. He had successively gone through the profession of a singing boy, sexton, sailor, monk, peddler, soldier, and lackey. 
How charmed will those fathers be to hear that a captain who understands the Bulgarian military drill is coming to them." 
The two strangers were conducted between two files of musketeers, the Commandant was at the further end with a threecornered cap on his head, his gown tucked up, a sword by his side, and a halfpike in his hand; he made a sign, and instantly four and twenty soldiers drew up round the newcomers. 
He has just come from Mass and is at the parade," replied the sergeant, "and in about three hours' time you may possibly have the honor to kiss his spurs." 
Every word they uttered during this long conversation was productive of some new matter of astonishment. 
Candide, thunderstruck at the oddness of this speech, answered: Reverend Father, all the quarterings in the world are of no signification. I have delivered your sister from a Jew and an Inquisitor; she is under many obligations to me, and she is resolved to give me her hand. 
Good God!" cried he, "I have killed my old master, my friend, my brotherinlaw. I am the best man in the world, and yet I have already killed three men, and of these three, two were priests." 
At length a beautiful meadow, intersected with purling rills, opened to their view. 
Dear sir," replied Cacambo, "you are surprised at everything. Why should you think it so strange that there should be a country where monkeys insinuate themselves into the good graces of the ladies? 
Now you are convinced," said Cacambo, "that it is very true, and you see what use is made of those creatures by persons who have not had a proper education; all I am afraid of is that these same ladies may play us some ugly trick." These judicious reflections operated so far on Candide as to make him quit the meadow and strike into a thicket. 
You imagine you are going to roast a Jesuit, whereas my master is your friend, your defender, and you are going to spit the very man who has been destroying your enemies; as to myself, I am your countryman; this gentleman is my master, and so far from being a Jesuit, give me leave to tell you he has very lately killed one of that order, whose spoils he now wears, and which have probably occasioned your mistake. 
Candide and His Valet Arrive in the Country of El DoradoWhat They Saw There When to the frontiers of the Oreillons, said Cacambo to Candide, You see, this hemisphere is not better than the other; now take my advice and let us return to Europe by the shortest way possible." 
Agreed," replied Candide; "let us recommend ourselves to Providence." 
They were obliged to creep along, from rock to rock, for the space of a league, till at length a spacious plain presented itself to their sight. 
Our travelers picked some of them up, and they proved to be gold, emeralds, rubies, and diamonds; the least of which would have been the greatest ornament to the superb throne of the Great Mogul. 
Cacambo went up to the door and heard those within talking in the Peruvian language, which was his mother tongue; for everyone knows that Cacambo was born in a village of Tucuman, where no other language is spoken. 
Several sorts of liquors, extracted from the sugarcane, were handed about by the servants who attended. 
They entered a very plain house, for the door was nothing but silver, and the ceiling was only of beaten gold, but wrought in such elegant taste as to vie with the richest. 
I am now one hundred and seventytwo years old, and I learned of my late father, who was equerry to the King, the amazing revolutions of Peru, to which he had been an eyewitness. 
Candide had a curiosity to see some of their priests, and desired Cacambo to ask the old man where they were. 
This long conversation being ended, the old man ordered six sheep to be harnessed and put to the coach, and sent twelve of his servants to escort the travelers to court. 
Candide and Cacambo accordingly threw their arms round His Majesty's neck, who received them in the most gracious manner imaginable, and very politely asked them to sup with him. 
As they drew near the town they saw a Negro stretched on the ground with only one half of his habit, which was a kind of linen frock; for the poor man had lost his left leg and his right hand. 
Yes, sir," said the Negro; "it is the custom here. They give a linen garment twice a year, and that is all our covering. When we labor in the sugar works, and the mill happens to snatch hold of a finger, they instantly chop off our hand; and when we attempt to run away, they cut off a leg. 
Alas!" replied Candide, "it is the obstinacy of maintaining that everything is best when it is worst." And so saying he turned his eyes towards the poor Negro, and shed a flood of tears; and in this weeping mood he entered the town of Surinam. 
The fair Cunegund is the Governor's favorite mistress." 
Cacambo set out the same day. 
And pray," said he to Martin, "what is your opinion of the whole of this system? 
And yet there is some good in the world," replied Candide. 
Each took out his glass, and they spied two ships warmly engaged at the distance of about three miles. 
After several smart broadsides the one gave the other a shot between wind and water which sunk her outright. 
Then could Candide and Martin plainly perceive a hundred men on the deck of the vessel which was sinking, who, with hands uplifted to Heaven, sent forth piercing cries, and were in a moment swallowed up by the waves. 
As he was speaking thus he spied something of a shining red hue, which swam close to the vessel. 
At my arrival I was robbed of all I had in the world by pickpockets and sharpers, at the fair of SaintGermain. I was taken up myself for a robber, and confined in prison a whole week; after which I hired myself as corrector to a press in order to get a little money towards defraying my expenses back to Holland on foot. 
Candide refused to comply with his request; but the two devotees assured him that it was a new fashion. 
Martin swore in his turn that he would bury the clerk alive if he continued to plague them any longer. 
The author does not understand a word of Arabic, and yet he has laid his scene in Arabia, and what is more, he is a fellow who does not believe in innate ideas. 
Candide was greatly taken with an actress, who performed the part of Queen Elizabeth in a dull kind of tragedy that is played sometimes. 
They buried her at the corner of Burgundy Street, which must certainly have shocked her extremely, as she had very exalted notions of things." 
Is it true," said Candide, "that the people of Paris are always laughing?" 
The abbe was not a person to show his face at this lady's house, which was frequented by none but the best company. 
She is engaged this evening," said he, "but I will do myself the honor to introduce you to a lady of quality of my acquaintance, at whose house you will see as much of the manners of Paris as if you had lived here for forty years." 
Candide, who was naturally curious, suffered himself to be conducted to this lady's house, which was in the suburbs of SaintHonore. 
This lady assumed the title of Marchioness of Parolignac. 
Her daughter, a girl of about fifteen years of age, was one of the punters, and took care to give her mamma a hint, by signs, when any one of the players attempted to repair the rigor of their ill fortune by a little innocent deception. 
The company were thus occupied when Candide, Martin, and the abbe made their entrance; not a creature rose to salute them, or indeed took the least notice of them, being wholly intent upon the business at hand. 
Pray," said the abbe, "good folks, have you seen the romance written by a certain Gauchat, Doctor of Divinity?" 
The man makes me quite sick! A few pages of the good archdeacon are enough in conscience to satisfy anyone." 
There was at the table a person of learning and taste, who supported what the Marchioness had advanced. 
You fell in love with her, I find, in stooping to pick up her handkerchief which she had dropped; you shall pick up my garter." 
I am more of a Manichaean now than ever," said Martin. 
The officer then explained to them what the abbe meant. 
So saying, he ordered Candide's irons to be struck off, acknowledged himself mistaken, and sent his followers about their business, after which he conducted Candide and Martin to Dieppe, and left them to the care of his brother. 
Candide and Martin Touch upon the English CoastWhat They See There Ah Pangloss! 
From thence they proceeded to the Straits, entered the Mediterranean, and at length arrived at Venice. 
His melancholy increased, and Martin never ceased trying to prove to him that there is very little virtue or happiness in this world; except, perhaps, in El Dorado, where hardly anybody can gain admittance. 
While they were disputing on this important subject, and still expecting Miss Cunegund, Candide perceived a young Theatin friar in the Piazza San Marco, with a girl under his arm. 
The girl was pretty, and was singing a song; and every now and then gave her Theatin an amorous ogle and wantonly pinched his ruddy cheeks. 
Candide had not regarded her with any degree of attention before, being wholly occupied with the thoughts of his dear Cunegund. 
Ah! is it you, child? was it you that reduced Dr. Pangloss to that fine condition I saw him in?" 
They pretend this man is a perfect stranger to uneasiness. I should be glad to see so extraordinary a being," said Martin. 
Candide and Martin Pay a Visit to Seignor Pococurante, a Noble Venetian Candide and his friend Martin went in a gondola on the Brenta, and arrived at the palace of the noble Pococurante. 
After having refreshed himself, Candide walked into a large gallery, where he was struck with the sight of a fine collection of paintings. 
In short, notwithstanding the encomiums lavished upon them, they are not, in my opinion, a true representation of nature. 
I have asked some learned men, whether they are not in reality as much tired as myself with reading this poet: those who spoke ingenuously, assured me that he had made them fall asleep, and yet that they could not well avoid giving him a place in their libraries; but that it was merely as they would do an antique, or those rusty medals which are kept only for curiosity, and are of no manner of use in commerce." 
There are maxims in this writer," replied Pococurante, "whence a man of the world may reap some benefit; and the short measure of the verse makes them more easily to be retained in the memory. 
I see a prodigious number of plays," said Candide, "in Italian, Spanish, and French." 
Martin, perceiving some shelves filled with English books, said to the senator, "I fancy that a republican must be highly delighted with those books, which are most of them written with a noble spirit of freedom." 
As soon as our two travelers had taken leave of His Excellency, Candide said to Martin, "Well, I hope you will own that this man is the happiest of all mortals, for he is above everything he possesses." 
Carry me to her this instant, that I may die with joy in her presence." 
I cannot at present stay to say anything more to you; I am a slave, and my master waits for me; I must go and attend him at table: but mum! say not a word, only get your supper, and hold yourself in readiness." 
Candide and Martin then took it for granted that this was some of the diversions of the Carnival, and that these were characters in masquerade. 
I am going to Rome to visit the King, my father, who was dethroned as well as myself; and my grandfather and I have come to spend the Carnival at Venice." 
Accordingly they both embarked, after paying their obeisance to his miserable Highness. 
As soon as Candide set his foot on board the vessel, he flew to his old friend and valet Cacambo and, throwing his arms about his neck, embraced him with transports of joy. 
My dear master," replied Cacambo, "Miss Cunegund washes dishes on the banks of the Propontis, in the house of a prince who has very few to wash. 
Why, then, Christian cur," replied the Turkish captain, "since these two dogs of Christian slaves are barons and metaphysicians, who no doubt are of high rank in their own country, thou shalt give me fifty thousand sequins." 
Candide instantly sent for a Jew, to whom he sold for fifty thousand sequins a diamond richly worth one hundred thousand, though the fellow swore to him all the time by Father Abraham that he gave him the most he could possibly afford. 
The latter flung himself at the feet of his deliverer, and bathed him with his tears; the former thanked him with a gracious nod, and promised to return him the money the first opportunity. 
But I would fain know how my sister came to be a scullion to a Transylvanian prince, who has taken refuge among the Turks?" 
Even the tender Candide, that affectionate lover, upon seeing his fair Cunegund all sunburned, with bleary eyes, a withered neck, wrinkled face and arms, all covered with a red scurf, started back with horror; but, not withstanding, recovering himself, he advanced towards her out of good manners. 
They saw several heads curiously stuck upon poles, and carried as presents to the Sublime Porte. 
This couple had been in the utmost distress; they had very speedily made away with their three thousand piastres; they had parted, been reconciled; quarreled again, been thrown into prison; had made their escape, and at last Brother Giroflee had turned Turk. 
I have no more than twenty acres of ground," he replied, "the whole of which I cultivate myself with the help of my children; and our labor keeps off from us three great evilsidleness, vice, and want." 
Cunegund indeed was very ugly, but she became an excellent hand at pastrywork: Pacquette embroidered; the old woman had the care of the linen. 
Stepan Arkadyevitch's eyes twinkled gaily, and he pondered with a smile. 
Tearing open the telegram, he read it through, guessing at the words, misspelt as they always are in telegrams, and his face brightened. 
Matvey nodded at the lookingglass. 
Stepan Arkadyevitch was already washed and combed and ready to be dressed, when Matvey, stepping deliberately in his creaky boots, came back into the room with the telegram in his hand. The barber had gone. 
As he sipped his coffee, he opened a still damp morning paper, and began reading it. 
But her face, to which she tried to give a severe and resolute expression, betrayed bewilderment and suffering. 
Dolly! he said, sobbing now; for mercy's sake, think of the children; they are not to blame! 
Dolly, one word more, he said, following her. 
Stepan Arkadyevitch was fond of a joke: And maybe she will come round! That's a good expression, 'come round,' he thought. 
Darya Alexandrovna meanwhile having pacified the child, and knowing from the sound of the carriage that he had gone off, went back again to her bedroom. It was her solitary refuge from the household cares which crowded upon her directly she went out from it. 
He was born in the midst of those who had been and are the powerful ones of this world. 
Where is he? 
That is he, said the doorkeeper, pointing to a strongly built, broadshouldered man with a curly beard, who, without taking off his sheepskin cap, was running lightly and rapidly up the worn steps of the stone staircase.b One of the members going downa lean official with a portfoliostood out of his way and looked disapprovingly at the legs of the stranger, then glanced inquiringly at Oblonsky. 
Though he had a great respect for his halfbrother, an author well known to all Russia, he could not endure it when people treated him not as Konstantin Levin, but as the brother of the celebrated Koznishev. 
Oh, where shall we meet? 
No, answered Levin, after an instant's thought, I have got to go on somewhere else. 
During the consultation with the secretary Levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment. He was standing with his elbows on the back of a chair, and on his face was a look of ironical attention. 
Oh, we'll talk about that, too, later on, said Levin, reddening again up to his ears. 
I see, said Stepan Arkadyevitch. 
The families of the Levins and the Shtcherbatskys were old, noble Moscow families, and had always been on intimate and friendly terms. 
But he (he knew very well how he must appear to others) was a country gentleman, occupied in breeding cattle, shooting game, and building barns; in other words, a fellow of no ability, who had not turned out well, and who was doing just what, according to the ideas of the world, is done by people fit for nothing else. 
But here it seemed to Levin that just as they were close upon the real point of the matter, they were again retreating, and he made up his mind to put a question to the professor. 
This brother Nikolay was the elder brother of Konstantin Levin, and halfbrother of Sergey Ivanovitch; a man utterly ruined, who had dissipated the greater part of his fortune, was living in the strangest and lowest company, and had quarreled with his brothers. 
Levin got up from his chair, as though on the point of starting off at once. 
Levin read in the queer, familiar handwriting: I humbly beg you to leave me in peace. 
The first thing to do to set his heart at rest was to accomplish what he had come to Moscow for. 
And the more he tried to compose himself, the more breathless he found himself. 
He walked on a few steps, and the skatingground lay open before his eyes, and at once, amidst all the skaters, he knew her. 
Everything was made bright by her. She was the smile that shed light on all round her. 
She skated a little uncertainly; taking her hands out of the little muff that hung on a cord, she held them ready for emergency, and looking towards Levin, whom she had recognized, she smiled at him, and at her own fears. 
When he thought of her, he could call up a vivid picture of her to himself, especially the charm of that little fair head, so freely set on the shapely girlish shoulders, and so full of childish brightness and good humor. 
This way, your excellency, please. Your excellency won't be disturbed here, said a particularly pertinacious, whiteheaded old Tatar with immense hips and coattails gaping widely behind. 
Stepan Arkadyevitch became thoughtful. How if we were to change our program, Levin? he said keeping his finger on the bill of fare. 
Do try, now, and put yourself in my place, take the point of view of a country person. We in the country try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most convenient for working with. 
His work is with the mind... 
Yes, I shall certainly go, replied Levin; though I fancied the princess was not very warm in her invitation. 
You guess? responded Levin, his eyes like deep wells of light fixed on Stepan Arkadyevitch. 
It seems so to me sometimes. 
But for God's sake, be quite straightforward with me. 
Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed, remembering his position with his wife, and, after a moment's silence, resumedShe has a gift of foreseeing things. 
He walked with his firm tread twice up and down the little cage of a room, blinked his eyelids that his tears might not fall, and only then sat down to the table. 
There's one other thing I ought to tell you. Do you know Vronsky? Stepan Arkadyevitch asked Levin. No, I don't. 
I've told you what I know, and I repeat that in this delicate and tender matter, as far as one can conjecture, I believe the chances are in your favor. 
When the Tatar appeared with a bill for twentysix roubles and odd kopecks, besides a tip for himself, Levin, who would another time have been horrified, like any one from the country, at his share of fourteen roubles, did not notice it, paid, and set off homewards to dress and go to the Shtcherbatskys' there to decide his fate. 
Her husband, about whom everything was well known before hand, had come, looked at his future bride, and been looked at. 
Afterwards, on a day fixed beforehand, the expected offer was made to her parents, and accepted. 
She was afraid that her daughter, who had at one time, as she fancied, a feeling for Levin, might, from extreme sense of honor, refuse Vronsky, and that Levin's arrival might generally complicate and delay the affair so near being concluded. 
There's one thing I want to say... began the princess, and from her serious and alert face, Kitty guessed what it would be. Mamma, she said, flushing hotly and turning quickly to her, please, please don't say anything about that. 
My God! shall I myself really have to say it to him? she thought. 
No, that's impossible. 
But this was just what I wanted, to find you alone, be began, not sitting down, and not looking at her, so as not to lose courage. 
He glanced at her; she blushed, and ceased speaking. 
I told you I did not know whether I should be here long...that it depended on you... 
Thank God, she has refused him, thought the mother, and her face lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her guests on Thursdays. 
Levin belonged to the second class. 
But he had no difficulty in finding what was good and attractive in Vronsky. 
Greeting and saying a few words to everyone, he sat down without once glancing at Levin, who had never taken his eyes off him. 
Let me introduce you, said the princess, indicating Levin. Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, Count Alexey Kirillovitch Vronsky. 
Levin wanted to, and could not, take part in the general conversation; saying to himself every instant, Now go, he still did not go, as though waiting for something. 
Why do you ask me? You know what I shall say. 
Why should there not be some new force, still unknown to us, which... 
When electricity was discovered, Levin interrupted hurriedly, it was only the phenomenon that was discovered, and it was unknown from what it proceeded and what were its effects, and ages passed before its applications were conceived. 
Vronsky listened attentively to Levin, as he always did listen, obviously interested in his words. Yes, but the spiritualists say we don't know at present what this force is, but there is a force, and these are the conditions in which it acts. 
Ah! he began joyously. 
She, pleased and happy after her conversation with her daughter, had gone to the prince to say goodnight as usual, and though she had no intention of telling him of Levin's offer and Kitty's refusal, still she hinted to her husband that she fancied things were practically settled with Vronsky, and that he would declare himself so soon as his mother arrived. 
I don't try to catch them in the least. 
Ah! your excellency! cried Oblonsky, whom are you meeting? 
And whom are you meeting? he asked. 
Oh, you've come, he said, addressing a tall old footman of his mother's, standing at the door; come here. 
Yes; but he left rather early. 
Do you mean he made your bellesoeur an offer yesterday? Maybe, said Stepan Arkadyevitch. 
His mother, a driedup old lady with black eyes and ringlets, screwed up her eyes, scanning her son, and smiled slightly with her thin lips. 
Getting up from the seat and handing her maid a bag, she gave her little wrinkled hand to her son to kiss, and lifting his head from her hand, kissed him on the cheek. 
It's the Petersburg view, madame. 
She's very sweet, isn't she? said the countess of Madame Karenina. Her husband put her with me, and I was delighted to have her. 
Let me have a kiss of your pretty face. I speak plainly, at my age, and I tell you simply that I've lost my heart to you. Stereotyped as the phrase was, Madame Karenina obviously believed it and was delighted by it. 
Ah, Anna, if you had seen it! Ah, how awful! he said. 
They went out together. 
Goodbye, countess. 
On the contrary, I think it's the easiestinstantaneous, observed another. 
Have you known Vronsky long? she asked. 
Come now, let us talk of you, she added, tossing her head, as though she would physically shake off something superfluous oppressing her. Let us talk of your affairs. I got your letter, and here I am. 
She always set to work on it at depressed moments, and now she knitted at it nervously, twitching her fingers and counting the stitches. 
But why should I not receive her? 
All these days Dolly had been alone with her children. She did not want to talk of her sorrow, but with that sorrow in her heart she could not talk of outside matters. 
Well, come along, I'll take you to your room, she went on, trying to defer as long as possible the moment of confidences. 
Is this Grisha? 
She mentioned them, not only remembering the names, but the years, months, characters, illnesses of all the children, and Dolly could not but appreciate that. 
Dolly, dear, she said, I don't want to speak for him to you, nor to try to comfort you; that's impossible. 
Dolly looked at her inquiringly. 
You know how I was married. 
I can understand being carried away by feeling, she went on after a brief silence, but deliberately, slyly deceiving me...and with whom?... 
He's happy and contented. Oh, no! 
Is he capable of remorse? Dolly interrupted, gazing intently into her sisterinlaw's face. 
Dolly grew calmer, and for two minutes both were silent. 
I saw nothing but him, and that the family was broken up. 
I felt sorry for him, but after talking to you, I see it, as a woman, quite differently. I see your agony, and I can't tell you how sorry I am for you! 
I remember the time when he came to me and cried, talking of you, and all the poetry and loftiness of his feeling for you, and I know that the longer he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes. 
Anna spent the whole morning with Dolly and the children. 
After dinner, when Dolly went away to her own room, Anna rose quickly and went up to her brother, who was just lighting a cigar. Stiva, she said to him, winking gaily, crossing him and glancing towards the door, go, and God help you. 
Why, are there balls where one always enjoys oneself? Anna said, with tender irony. 
Here, take it, she said to Tanya, who was bulling the looselyfitting ring off her white, slendertipped finger. 
How I should like to know all her love story! thought Kitty, recalling the unromantic appearance of Alexey Alexandrovitch, her husband. 
I know mothers are partial, but... 
But she did not tell Kitty about the two hundred roubles. For some reason it was disagreeable to her to think of it. She felt that there was something that had to do with her in it, and something that ought not to have been. 
Dolly came out of her room to the tea of the grownup people. 
What's the question? inquired Stepan Arkadyevitch, coming out of his room and addressing his wife. 
Why do you always look down on me and Matvey? said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling hardly perceptibly, and addressing his wife. 
The whole evening Dolly was, as always, a little mocking in her tone to her husband, while Stepan Arkadyevitch was happy and cheerful, but not so as to seem as though, having been forgiven, he had forgotten his offense. 
She thought that she was the only person who knew why he had come, and why he would not come up. 
A beardless youth, one of those society youths whom the old Prince Shtcherbatsky called young bucks, in an exceedingly open waistcoat, straightening his white tie as he went, bowed to them, and after running by, came back to ask Kitty for a quadrille. 
Although her dress, her coiffure, and all the preparations for the ball had cost Kitty great trouble and consideration, at this moment she walked into the ballroom in her elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip as easily and simply as though all the rosettes and lace, all the minute details of her attire, had not cost her or her family a moment's attention, as though she had been born in that tulle and lace, with her hair done up high on her head, and a rose and two leaves on the top of it. 
Her bare shoulders and arms gave Kitty a sense of chill marble, a feeling she particularly liked. Her eyes sparkled, and her rosy lips could not keep from smiling from the consciousness of her own attractiveness. 
She looked round for someone to give her fan to, and their hostess, smiling to her, took it. 
How nice you've come in good time, he said to her, embracing her waist; such a bad habit to be late. 
On her head, among her black hairher own, with no false additionswas a little wreath of pansies, and a bouquet of the same in the black ribbon of her sash among white lace. 
Kitty gazed in admiration at Anna waltzing, and listened to him. 
Nothing but the stern discipline of her bringingup supported her and forced her to do what was expected of her, that is, to dance, to answer questions, to talk, even to smile. 
Oh, I don't care! answered Kitty. 
Vronsky and Anna sat almost opposite her. 
At home? 
Konstantin Levin looked in at the door, and saw that the speaker was a young man with an immense shock of hair, wearing a Russian jerkin, and that a pockmarked woman in a woolen gown, without collar or cuffs, was sitting on the sofa. 
So you see, pursued Nikolay Levin, painfully wrinkling his forehead and twitching. It was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and do. 
But with me, it's another thing; I see through his ideas, and I know where its weakness lies. 
Nikolay Dmitrievitch's health has become very poor. 
Why don't you get married? 
I live quite independently of him. 
Ah, ah! You see that, you see that! Nikolay shouted joyfully. 
All these traces of his life seemed to clutch him, and to say to him: No, you're not going to get away from us, and you're not going to be different, but you're going to be the same as you've always been; with doubts, everlasting dissatisfaction with yourself, vain efforts to amend, and falls, and everlasting expectation, of a happiness which you won't get, and which isn't possible for you. 
He knew that this was stupid, he knew that it was positively not right, and contrary to his present new plans, but this house was a whole world to Levin. 
And suddenly there floated into his mind the joyful thought: In two years' time I shall have two Dutch cows; Pava herself will perhaps still be alive, a dozen young daughters of Berkoot and the three othershow lovely! 
'How can it interest you so much?' says a visitor. 
But who will she be? 
I have spoiled...I've been the cause of that ball being a torture to her instead of a pleasure. 
I'm not Stiva, she said, knitting her brows. 
Possibly against my own will... She crimsoned and stopped. 
Come, it's all over, and thank God! was the first thought that came to Anna Arkadyevna, when she had said goodbye for the last time to her brother, who had stood blocking up the entrance to the carriage till the third bell rang. 
With her little deft hands she opened and shut her little red bag, took out a cushion, laid it on her knees, and carefully wrapping up her feet, settled herself comfortably. 
Farther on, it was continually the same again and again: the same shaking and rattling, the same snow on the window, the same rapid transitions from steaming heat to cold, and back again to heat, the same passing glimpses of the same figures in the twilight, and the same voices, and Anna began to read and to understand what she read. 
For a moment she regained her selfpossession, and realized that the thin peasant who had come in wearing a long overcoat, with buttons missing from it, was the stoveheater, that he was looking at the thermometer, that it was the wind and snow bursting in after him at the door; but then everything grew blurred again.... 
She got up and pulled herself together; she realized that they had reached a station and that this was the guard. 
At that moment the wind, as it were, surmounting all obstacles, sent the snow flying from the carriage roofs, and clanked some sheet of iron it had torn off, while the hoarse whistle of the engine roared in front, plaintively and gloomily. 
All the awfulness of the storm seemed to her more splendid now. 
It's wrong, what you say, and I beg you, if you're a good man, to forget what you've said, as I forget it, she said at last. 
Enough, enough! she cried trying assiduously to give a stern expression to her face, into which he was gazing greedily. 
He's quite well... Chapter 31 Vronsky had not even tried to sleep all that night. He sat in his armchair, looking straight before him or scanning the people who got in and out. 
Most fortunate, he said to his wife, dismissing Vronsky altogether, that I should just have half an hour to meet you, so that I can prove my devotion, he went on in the same jesting tone. You lay too much stress on your devotion for me to value it much, she responded in the same jesting tone, involuntarily listening to the sound of Vronsky's steps behind them. 
The Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a tall, stout woman, with an unhealthily sallow face and splendid, pensive black eyes. 
Well, my dear, so you took the olive branch? inquired Countess Lidia Ivanovna, as soon as she came into the room. 
Then the countess told her of more disagreements and intrigues against the work of the unification of the churches, and departed in haste, as she had that day to be at the meeting of some society and also at the Slavonic committee. 
Precisely at five o'clock, before the bronze Peter the First clock had struck the fifth stroke, Alexey Alexandrovitch came in, wearing a white tie and evening coat with two stars, as he had to go out directly after dinner. 
Or has he had his hair cut? 
Baroness Shilton, a friend of Petritsky's, with a rosy little face and flaxen hair, resplendent in a lilac satin gown, and filling the whole room, like a canary, with her Parisian chatter, sat at the round table making coffee. 
There, you never know how to say such pretty things, said the baroness, turning to Petritsky. 
I'll put it in. 
Have you seen the new helmets? 
So we had better leave you? 
But we may suspect it. 
Oh, well, then I can do it in twenty minutes. 
This is the third time you've asked me the same thing. 
And the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess, as an exceptionally intelligent woman, the condition of the young princess, and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters, which were certainly harmless. 
Ah! to be so mistaken in people! said the princess, and by the change in her tone both Dolly and the prince knew she was speaking of Vronsky. 
I don't know why there aren't laws against such base, dishonorable people. 
You're wretched too, I know. 
So did Kitty perhaps refuse him?... 
Nowadays they will all go their own way, and mothers haven't a word to say in anything, and then... 
I am too proud ever to allow myself to care for a man who does not love me. 
Vronsky, seeing his cousin from his stall in the front row, did not wait till the entr'acte, but went to her box. 
Vronsky looked inquiringly at her. 
But why was it you didn't come to dinner? she said, admiring him. 
Well, listen: two festive young men were drivingOfficers of your regiment, of course? 
They were driving on their way to dinner with a friend in the most festive state of mind. 
Well, bonne chance! she added, giving Vronsky one finger of the hand in which she held her fan, and with a shrug of her shoulders she twitched down the bodice of her gown that had worked up, so as to be duly naked as she moved forward towards the footlights into the light of the gas, and the sight of all eyes. 
However often you see her, every day she's different. 
Don't you think there's something Louis Quinze about Tushkevitch? he said, glancing towards a handsome, fairhaired young man, standing at the table. 
How can she help it if they're all in love with her, and follow her about like shadows? 
Ah, here you are at last! she said, turning with a smile to Vronsky, as he came in. 
Can one talk of love in these days? said the ambassador's wife. 
Yes, but then how often the happiness of these prudent marriages flies away like dust just because that passion turns up that they have refused to recognize, said Vronsky. 
Really? said Vronsky, knitting his brows. 
I don't quite understand the meaning of your words, he said, handing her the cup. she glanced towards the sofa beside her, and he instantly sat down. 
Do you suppose I don't know that I've acted wrongly? 
I want you to go to Moscow and ask for Kitty's forgiveness, she said. You don't wish that? he said. 
Her glance, the touch of her hand, set him aflame. 
But after all, he asked himself before turning into the boudoir, what has occurred? 
But other people noticed it, and that's what upsets him. 
Perhaps I am mistaken, but believe me, what I say, I say as much for myself as for you. 
She both feared his speaking and wished for it. 
It's late, it's late, she whispered with a smile. 
A long while she lay, not moving, with open eyes, whose brilliance she almost fancied she could herself see in the darkness. 
Nothing special happened. 
Involuntarily he talked to her in his habitual tone of jeering at anyone who should say what he was saying. 
Forgive me! she said, sobbing, pressing his hands to her bosom. 
There had been in his past, as in every man's, actions, recognized by him as bad, for which his conscience ought to have tormented him; but the memory of these evil actions was far from causing him so much suffering as those trivial but humiliating reminiscences. 
Easter came in the snow. 
And, as he came out into the farmyard, Levin, like a tree in spring that knows not what form will be taken by the young shoots and twigs imprisoned in its swelling buds, hardly knew what undertakings he was going to begin upon now in the farm work that was so dear to him. 
Why isn't the carpenter at the thrashing machine? 
Again they had not done as he had ordered. Why, but I told you during Lent to put in pipes, he cried. 
And they don't turn up. 
What if it's brother Nikolay? 
He did say: 'Maybe I'll go to the waters, or maybe I'll come down to you.' 
Ah, cried Levin joyfully, flinging up both his hands. Here's a delightful visitor! 
Leaving him there to wash and change his clothes, Levin went off to the counting house to speak about the ploughing and clover. 
Yes, but wait a bit. I'm not talking of political economy, I'm talking of the science of agriculture. 
Kouzma, who already scented a big tip, never left Stepan Arkadyevitch's side, and put on him both his stockings and boots, a task which Stepan Arkadyevitch readily left him. Kostya, give orders that if the merchant Ryabinin comes...I told him to come today, he's to be brought in and to wait for me... 
Why, do you mean to say you're selling the forest to Ryabinin? 
To be sure I do. I have had to do business with him, 'positively and conclusively.' 
A cigar is a sort of thing, not exactly a pleasure, but the crown and outward sign of pleasure. Come, this is life! 
There, do you see, you know the type of Ossian's women.... 
Well, then, it would be better not to study it. 
Now it's coming! 
Levin looked about him to right and to left, and there, just facing him against the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoots of the aspens, he saw the flying bird. 
Stepan Arkadyevitch shot two more birds and Levin two, of which one was not found. 
Isn't she a clever thing? he said, taking the warm bird from Laska's mouth and packing it into the almost full game bag. 
How Darwinists Twist the Truth 
He claims it is raining even though the sun is shining; and if you take him outside and show him the evident sunlight, still he persists in his claim that rain is falling and he even declares that he's getting wet! 
If you saw such a person, you could describe him in several ways. 
In short, the whole purpose of a spell is to bring someone under another's control and to make him believe the most unlikely, irrational things. This book's title, The Dark Spell of Darwinism, comes from this very analogy. 
The goal of Darwinism is to get people to reject the obvious fact of Creation, which is clearly evident and assured, and to believe in the myth embodied in the theory of evolution. 
That supreme Creator is Almighty God, the Lord of all the Worlds. 
He has revealed the Fact of Creation in such a way that human beings can discover it using their faculty of reason, and He has announced it to all people through the mediation of messengers whom He has chosen from among them. 
However, they say the same as previous peoples said. 
They say, "When we are dead and turned to dust and bones, shall we then be raised again? 
"We and our forefathers were promised this before. This is nothing but the myths of previous peoples!" 
(Qur'an, 23:7890) 
Why do some people employ such false suggestions and sorcery to deceive both themselves and others? 
They have made it a principle to stay unfettered and not to grant obedience to any authority: This is what leads them into disbelief. 
Thus the theory of evolution was born. Actually, the roots of Darwin's theory can be traced back to ancient times. 
Briefly, the theory of evolution claims that lifeless pieces of matter came together by chance, organizing themselves to produce living organisms. 
Facts authenticated by presentday's scientific research show the impossibility of living things arising by chance. They could have come to exist only as the result of a superior design; whose flawless plan is present and evident in every creature. 
Their motive, as we said before, is evident:Atheists and materialists need a socalled scientific support for denying the existence of God. 
We sent Messengers before you among the disparate groups of previous peoples. 
Even if We opened up to them a door into heaven, and they spent the day ascending through it, they would only say, "Our eyesight is befuddled! Or rather we have been put under a spell!" 
Those who espouse Darwinism today come at the head of these spellbound individuals. 
He describes the Darwinists' strange view that the extremely complex structures of living things came to be through chance occurrences: 
Evolutionists extend this scenario to the formation of human beings. 
They have conducted countless experiments using the best technology and under the supervision of experienced scientists, but have never been successful. 
Interestingly, evolutionists know quite well that life cannot come from lifeless matter. 
Take some matter, heat while stirring and wait. 
Like a sorcerer who combines some materials together and tries to cast a spell with a few magic words, so evolutionists believe that life was formed in a primordial soup existing in the world's earliest ages. 
Surely there is no difference between this story told by evolutionists and a sorcerer's tale. 
Surely, this would be impossible. 
Natural Selection: Assistant of the Imaginary "Mother Nature" 
But natural selection is based on the premise that living things can continue to survive only if they conform with the natural conditions in which they find themselves. Those individuals not equipped with attributes that ensure harmony with their environment will perish. 
Ifind it difficult to believe that the extravagant glories of birds, fish, flowers and other living forms were produced solely by natural selection;I find it incredible that human consciousness was such a product. 
Similarly, Cemal Yildirim, a leading evolutionist in Turkey, admits, despite his loyalty to the theory, that it is very difficult to believe that natural selection has any creative force. As he writes: 
As we've mentioned, Darwin believed that natural selection is the chief mechanism in the process of evolution. 
As a result of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima and the radiation leak in Chernobyl, children were born handicapped or developed leukemia because of the dangerous effects of mutations in their bodies. 
The noted evolutionist, Pierre Paul Grassé, admits that mutation cannot cause any development in a living creature or change it into another species. He says that to believe such a thing is pure fantasy: 
Evolutionists speak of stranger and more illogical things than the man who assaults his computer with a hammer in the hopes of developing a new one. But in spite of this, many people believe them. 
Therefore, any single cell contains thousands of proteins responsible for carrying out the activities that occur within that cell. 
There are many kinds of proteins, from those containing only 50 amino acids to others containing thousands. 
When you open your eyes, you will see you have produced an incomprehensible chaos of letters, perhaps something like this: 
In this way, you can never generate a short phrase, much less a sentence, that has any meaning. 
You will never compose a comprehensible paragraph. 
The reason why there are still so many atheist scientists, however, is because they are devoted to the theory of evolution as if it were a religion. 
The answer evolutionists give to this question shows their blind allegiance to their theory. 
They claim that the billions of bits of information relevant to a living creature have been encoded in DNA by a chance evolutionary process; the DNA then put itself—by chance and by the same natural process—into the cell's nucleus. 
The theory of evolution maintains that life came into being through the chance assembly of one cell. 
Over the past century, however, the rapid development of technology made it possible to investigate all aspects of a cell's amazingly complex structure, which proved to be one of the twentieth century's most important discoveries. 
This code had to be present at the origin of life. 
If such were the case, there must have been many transitional forms showing the gradual evolution between these two different groups. 
What does a chart like this tell us? 
There are, however, also some imaginary creatures, which have of course left no fossil record. 
Evolutionists claim there must be "transitional forms" showing the evolution of one life form into another, but there is no evidence of this in the fossil record. 
But this hasn't interrupted the zeal of evolutionists, some of whom continue to imagine the existence of transitional forms as a way out. 
There is no difference between what we have described above and the fantastic events in a children's cartoon. 
Actually, such faulty reasoning is the inheritance Charles Darwin left to modern evolutionists. 
Despite the fact that this claim was found unscientific and unworthy of consideration, Crick persuaded people to believe it. 
Some materialistminded people fall into contradictions that—for them—are unavoidable because although these people are clearly aware of the truth, they try to hide it. 
God reveals the following about the state that some materialists fall into: By Heaven with its oscillating orbits, you certainly have differing beliefs. 
Because of the spell he was under, he thought sunny sky was cloudy and even claimed that it was raining. 
One of the most difficult questions they strive to answer is how dinosaurs were suddenly able to fly. 
A fly moves its wings between 500 and 1000 times a second and can suddenly maneuver in any direction it wants. Ask any evolutionist scientist how this ability could have come into existence by chance. 
According to evolutionists, reptiles—for example—are the ancestors of birds and mammals. 
Certain sweat glands began to secrete a richer and richer secretion, which eventually became milk. 
No creature could have even attempted to develop an eye for itself, if it did not know the concept of "seeing." 
First, could two cavities have been formed by chance in the skull to contain the eyes? 
This is because according to evolutionists, the nonfunctional organs of the body will atrophy over time. 
The list of questions could be considerably lengthened without affecting the monotony of the answers.36 
Just pondering the human spirit shows how absurdly misguided are the evolutionists' tales of chance. 
(Qur'an; 7:198) 
Methods of Persuasion Used 
There is only one answer to why the theory of evolution has become so widespread: because of special techniques, tactics and illusions of propaganda. 
In order to make themselves and others believe this idea, they cast a kind of spell using methods that we’ll examine in detail in the following pages. 
As pointed out earlier, this spell’s suggestiveness spreads into every moment of our daily lives: in the morning newspaper, on billboards, in school textbooks, in films and television documentaries. 
In the following pages, we’ll offer some examples of the main rules governing the evolutionists’ use of the power of suggestion. 
They assume that evolutionist scientists have given them all the data they need, and that their statements are absolutely true. 
They are proud if they can demonstrate some understanding of even a few paragraphs within this complex and incomprehensible mass. 
In these verses, God describes the state of those people who, in spite of their knowledge, are unable to conceive of His existence or the existence of the afterlife, and who claim that there is no life beyond this world. 
From these comments, it is clear that his theory had come to a major impasse, and not only Darwin became aware of this. 
As a physicist, I was particularly intrigued by his comments on how the eye would have arisen.41 
As he says, evolutionists present their theory to the public with an aura of scientific acceptance, accusing as "dogmatic" scientists who draw their attention to the fact of Creation. 
The support of such respected people is doubtlessly gratifying. 
Unless some scientists with a good grasp of this issue provide scientific refutations for the justifications put forward by the SRF, appealing to authorities or hoping patriotic literature to get results will be only a daydream.45 
Moreover, we must make it clear that there’s no value in being in the majority; and evolutionists are not the only ones to make this suggestion. 
With such suggestions as "Look, everyone rejects religion; can so many people be wrong?" they’ve tried to divert people from the path that God invites them to follow. 
We never sent a warner into any city without the affluent people in it saying, "We reject what you have been sent with." 
But the majority of mankind do not know it." 
As examples, here are the titles of some of their articles: 
Evolutionists must especially answer how the first cells and first living creatures came into being. Where did the mindbogglingly sophisticated systems within a cell come from? And how did the imaginary transition from sea to land occur? 
They’re especially upset at the prospect that young people will come to know that Darwinism is a fabrication, since they trust that youth will be defenders of the theory in the future. 
Seeing them as a guarantee for the future, they want to make sure that youngsters never lose the suggestions about Darwinism put into their minds. 
Umit Sayin, a longtime writer for the evolutionist journal Bilim Utopya (Science Utopia), expresses this blind allegiance with the words, "Let’s assume that we have not found any fossils yet; then this shows that all life forms have disappeared, or amalgamated into nature," or "Let’s say that all fossils had not ended up as we hoped! 
And our Machists [an adherent of Machism, a modern positivist philosophy], have all become ensnared in idealism, that is, in a diluted, subtle fideism;They became ensnared from the moment they took "sensation" not as an image of the external world, but as a special "element." 
Large "populations" of cars would be found on the various floors, but only a few on the ramps. 
According to evolutionists, each of them evolved in slow stages from another creature. 
First, there was a starfish; then two arms of the starfish begin to take the shape of fins. 
And in the final stage, there is no more starfish; there is a fish. 
The reality stated in Behe’s words is quite clear: Evolutionists give no clear answer to questions about life’s real origins, because it’s impossible to answer these questions in terms of evolutionary processes and random stages of development. 
But in what they say, there is nothing to support the theory of evolution. 
The evolutionary biologist Christopher Wills resorts to the same method in one of his books: 
A friend of mine has been working on an encyclopedic evolution book for years and I wish him luck.52 
It’s easy to see how irrational and unrealistic this example is. 
But then one is lulled, overwhelmed and stupefied by the by the gradualness of it all, which is at best a platitude, only good for pacifying the mind, since no one is willing to imagine that civilization appeared in a thunderclap.57 
But he cannot answer questions about who did the programming, how creatures were programmed and what the purpose of this programming is. 
According to Dawkins, there is a program of which the programmer is unknown. 
According to the noted American professor of biochemistry, Michael J. Behe, evolutionists strive to explain every subject, relevant or irrelevant, in terms of evolution: 
Therefore, they rate everything from economy to the marriage as a matter of evolution. 
At the same time, this method lets evolutionists cast their spell over every area of life. 
For example, when speaking about technological operations or the development of computers, at any moment they can stop what they are saying to make a comment devoid of all scientific meaning such as, "This is a fine example of the process of evolution." 
But actually, he has no proof that can let him make any assertions. 
How could an archeologist excavating the site 1.5 million years later distinguish between this scenario and the previously favored interpretation of butchering by a group of nomadic hunters and gatherers? 
In these statements, Leakey clearly says that these detailed descriptions are based not on science, but on "instinct." 
That is, reconstructions claiming to describe the origins of human beings reflect only the imagination of the fossil expert, the illustrator, or the sculptor. 
Therefore, Darwinists make the most of technology and all other means at their disposal to persuade the public. 
The information and topics are presented in an attractive package to awaken trust in the reader. Hiding behind this mask of striking beauty, the spell will combine with the other elements to produce the desired effect. 
In fact, as said before, all the information and accounts presented as scientific proofs in every evolutionist book are weak and insubstantial enough to be invalidated by a pamphlet you could fit into your pocket. 
Furthermore, attempts are even made to intimidate and deride them. 
This is one of the evolutionists’ most effective methods of suggestion used to perpetuate the Darwinist spell. 
Those who practice it also hope to elevate themselves to the forefront and receive the respect of others. 
In this way, they hope to cover up their deficiencies and lack of knowledge. 
Thus, we realize that the reason why Darwinists react snidely to scientific proofs is totally ideological. 
It is, after all, the people themselves who will break this spell. 
He said, "Yes, and you will be among those brought near." 
But our world needs intelligent and aware young people who have shaken off the influence of dark spells, who can think freely, and who exercise strong faculties of judgment and discernment. 
Umit Sayin, Bilim Utopya (Science Utopia Journal), November 1998, Vol. 53, p. 
In other words, they examine the designs God has created in nature and, then inspired, go on to develop new technologies. 
As biomimetics emerges, imitating the structures of living systems, it presents a major setback for those scientists who still support the theory of evolution. 
From an evolutionist’s point of view, it’s entirely unacceptable for men—whom they regard as the highest rung on the evolutionary ladder—to try to draw inspiration from (much less imitate) other living things which, allegedly, are so much more primitive than they are. 
It also describes how nature’s many varied and highly efficient mechanisms, which baffle the proponents of evolution, are all products of our Lord’s unique creation. 
Biomimetics is the term used to describe the substances, equipment, mechanisms and systems by which humans imitate natural systems and designs, especially in the fields of defense, nanotechnology1, robot technology, and artificial intelligence (also known as AI, for short). 
Bees’, turtles’ and birds’ ability to navigate without maps, 
As our information accumulates and technological possibilities increase, their potential becomes ever clearer. 
Painters and architects of the time, influenced by the beauties of the natural world, duplicated these structures’ external appearance in their own creations. 
The emerging materials, structures and machines being developed through biomimetics can be used in new solar cells, advanced robots and future spacecraft. 
From that perspective, nature’s designs are opening incredibly broad horizons. 
The correct use of this resource will certainly lead to a process of rapid developments in technology. 
A few of the scientific papers dealing with these matters include: 
Aksay found that its lamination helps keep cracks from propagating, in roughly the same way that a braided rope doesn’t fail when one single strand breaks.18 
This represents a distinct advantage for consumers and scientists alike.21 
Manmade materials eventually crack and shatter. 
Recently, in imitation, scientists have begun development of substances such as polymers and polycyclates, which can renew themselves.22 In the search to develop strong, selfrenewing bioinspired materials, one natural substance taken as a model is rhinoceros horn. 
Most of the materials in nature consist of composites. Composites are solid materials that result when two or more substances are combined to form a new substance possessing properties that are superior to those of the original ingredients.23 
The artificial composite known as fiberglass, for instance, is used in boat hulls, fishing rods, and sportsequipment materials such as bows and arrows. 
Ms. Benyus is a member of the teaching faculty at America’s Rutgers University. In her book Biomimicry, she states that the tendons in our muscles are constructed according to a very special method and goes on to say: 
During a whale’s nonfeeding migration of thousands of kilometers, when it is unable to find sufficient food, it obtains the needed energy from this fat in its body. 
Every time it beats its tail in the water, the elastic recoil of blubber is compressed and stretched. 
This not only provides the whale with extra speed, but also allows a 20% energy saving on long journeys. With all these properties, whale blubber is regarded as a substance with the very widest range of functions. 
When motherofpearl is stressed by a heavy load, any cracks that form begin to spread, but change direction as they attempt to pass through the protein layers. 
As this example shows, God clearly reveals evidence of His existence and the superior might and power of His creation by means of His infinite knowledge and wisdom. 
God is the Rich Beyond Need, the Praiseworthy. 
The Hardness of Wood Is Hidden in Its Design 
In particular, damage is reduced the most when the impact occurs at right angles to the direction of the grain. 
Moreover, these cells are enclosed in a complex polymer structure made of resin. 
Every detail of their flawless design—from the fineness of the layers to their density and the number of vessels—has been carefully planned and created to bring about resistance. 
It can stretch up to four times its own length. 
Keratin is the building block for such widely different natural substances as hair, nails, feathers and skin. In all the substances it comprises, its protective property is especially important. 
And finally, thanks to the perfect use of its back legs, the spider can put the thread on the desired track. 
On account of its high resistance to tension, ten times more energy is required to break spider silk than other, similar biological materials.35 
One main reason why spiders are able to produce such strong silk is that they manage to add assisting compounds with a regular structure by controlling the crystallization and folding of the basic protein compounds. 
Anyone who thinks about these questions will realize that everything we see around us is the work of a Creator possessed of reason and knowledge—our AllPowerful Lord. 
In nature also, animals and plants produce in their own cells a variety of substances to protect their outer surfaces against external damage. 
The complex chemical compounds produced by the bodies of living things astound scientists, and designers seek to imitate many examples. 
Many protective substances used in our daily lives were actually used long before in nature by living things. 
The hard shells of insects also protect them against water and damage from the outside. 
That is because whenever the smallest particle of dust lands on the plant, it immediately waves the leaf, directing the dust particles to one particular spot. 
There is no doubt, however, that neither the lotus’s external structure nor insects’ chitin layer came about by themselves. 
These living things are unaware of the superior properties they possess. 
It is God Who creates them, together with all their features. 
To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names. 
(Qur’an, 59: 24) 
This structure made the ZIC both light and strong.41 
Evolutionists—who maintain that life came about by chance and whose forms developed over time, always moving in the direction of improvement—find this and similar events difficult to accept. 
How can human beings, possessed of consciousness and reason, learn from plants—devoid of any intelligence or knowledge, which cannot even move—and implement what they learn to achieve ever more practical results? 
To keep leafchewing insects at bay, for example, plants sometimes produce noxious chemicals and in a few cases, chemicals to attract other predators to prey on those first ones. 
In the field of agriculture, in fact, efforts are going on to imitate this very useful defense strategy. 
No doubt it is impossible for a plant, lacking a brain, to arrive at a solution to danger, to analyze chemicals like a scientist, even to produce such a compound and carry out a planned strategy. 
In fact, a strand no thicker than a hair, containing 100 optical fibers, can transmit 40,000 different sound channels. 
Japanese engineers use this technology to transmit solar rays to those parts of skyscrapers that receive no direct light. 
It’s not something they’re going to put into telecommunications in the next two or three years. It’s something that might be 20 years off.46 
God, Who has designed everything down to the finest detail, has created these designs for mankind to learn from and think upon. 
Few, however, are aware that there are gearboxes and jet engines in nature, which possess designs far superior to those employed by man. 
Gearboxes allow you to change gears in the vehicle so that the motor is used most efficiently. 
The nautilus employs the same technique. 
Another very important point needs to be considered here. 
God’s title of alBadi’ (the Innovative Creator), is revealed in the Qur’an: 
Sound moves through air and water in the form of waves, which bounce back if they strike an object. 
Bats’ Sonar Goes Far Beyond the Bounds of Human Technology 
Furthermore, it can perceive these echoes with a resolution of only 0.3 millimeters (1/80th of an inch). 
Bats can seize an insect from midair as the insect rises from the grass. 
And there is certainly a lesson for you in your livestock. We give you to drink from what is in their bellies and there are many ways in which you benefit from them... (Qur’an, 23: 21) 
The echoes reflected from the object pass through the dolphin's lower jaw to the middle ear, and from there to the brain. 
Darcy Winslow, General Manager of Environmental Business Opportunities for Nike, expresses this truth: 
The extent to which the natural world can provide technological solutions for the types of product performance characteristics we must provide are virtually unlimited. 
Already, engineers influenced by bat's sonar have mounted a small sonar unit onto a pair of glasses. 
Still, the system’s designers stress that it will never replace human vision eye or be as functional as that of the bat. 
If a system can serve no purpose before it reaches its final form, there is no logical reason for it to maintain its existence over millions of years, while it refines and completes itself. 
In order to make the best use of echoes, other features of the bat were also borne in mind when designing the RoBat. 
Bats move their ears to detect interference patterns in the echoes and thus, can easily avoid obstacles in front of them, navigate and hunt down preys. 
In fact, such car manufacturers as Mercedes and BMW already use ultrasonic sensors to help drivers reverse. 
A Fish’s Detector Against Pollution 
But despite all the efforts expended toward this goal, we humans are nowhere near birds in this field. 
Indeed, the Wright brothers, regarded as the inventors of the airplane, used the vulture wing as a model when building the wings of their Kitty Hawk plane.62 
Predictably, it did not take them long to realize that wings alone were not enough to permit them to fly. 
In their view, reptiles turned into birds gradually, stage by stage. 
Those whom you call upon besides God are not even able to create a single fly, even if they were to join together to do it. 
Surface Drag and Swimsuits Inspired by Shark Skin 
Dr. Pearce says, “The Air Force wants to see if they can mimic the biological system and get a better missile detector.”72 But so far, he explains that studies carried out to that end have found it difficult to match the snake’s sensitivity: 
To understand the functioning of the pit organ, it is necessary to work with delicate measurements and photomicrographs. 
As this example shows, living things in nature display a superior intelligence and technology. 
It all just happened by itself.” 
Probably you’d imagine that person to be mad or else very ignorant. 
To claim that such a superior ability came about by chance is nonsensical and invalid. 
From the tip of their abdomens, fireflies produce greenyyellow light. 
What force allows fireflies to engage in such a high level of efficiency? 
In many verses of the Qur’an, God speaks of the need for people to use reason to consider and draw lessons from what He has created. 
Owl Flight and HighSpeed Train Noise 
Japan’s noise regulations regarding railway operators are the strictest in the world. 
At speeds of 200 kmph (125 mph) or over, however, the sound source becomes the aerodynamic noise caused by its movement through the air. 
Engineers, realizing that they couldn’t reduce noise levels with the conventional rectangular pantographs, concentrated their research on animals that move quickly, yet silently. 
At the exit, the waves then return. 
The very disturbing noise created under the influence of the pressure waves can be reduced by widening the tunnel, but the task of altering the crosssectional area of tunnels is very difficult and expensive. 
Peacock Feathers and SelfChanging Display Signs 
Nature inspired one Japanese company to develop reusable display signs, whose surfaces are structurally altered under ultraviolet light which changes the materials’s crystalline alignment, thus eliminating certain colors so as to display the desired message. 
This eliminates the cost of producing new signs, as well as the need for using toxic paints.83 
The solution is provided by the millions of microscopic scales, called thinfilm structures, clinging to their wings. 
Muscle is a soft, wet, contractile engine, and that’s just unlike anything in our technological armamentarium. 
In the heart, however, the container carries out its own pumping. 
Our natural hearts, on the other hand, have no need of a battery for energy, because they boast an incomparable muscular design capable of creating its own energy in every cell. 
In fact, the heart can pump five liters of blood a minute while at rest, which can rise to 2530 liters during exercise. 
The heart possesses the capacity for selfrenewal, which is why it never loses its ability for uninterrupted work. 
Computer viruses carry traces of the signature of the software writer that let them be recognized. 
When it encounters a foreign organism, the body immediately begins to build antibodies that will recognize the invader and destroy it. 
The eyes of vertebrates resemble spheres with openings called pupils through which light enters. 
Thanks to the muscles around it, the lens sends the image onto the retina. 
This photocell scans 625 or 819 lines in onetwenty fifth of a second. 
(Qur’an, 67: 23) 
Yes, powerful modern computers are capable of carrying out similar functions, but the retina’s neural network uses a relatively much smaller amount of energy.93 
For this purpose, it’s enough for sound to reach the closer ear first, then the more distant one. 
Since the designs in nature are quite flawless, their inspirations are now frequently employed in architectural designs. 
In this way, he succeeded in constructing a roof made of glass and iron, which was very light yet still very strong.98 
When it comes to the surface of the water it stops growing, then starts forming thorntipped buds. 
In the Amazon, beetles have a special attraction to the color white and therefore, select this lily’s flowers to land on. 
Even today, the Eiffel Tower is accepted as a marvel of engineering, but the event that led to its design took place back to 40 years before its construction. 
It isn’t chance that allows bees to construct their combs so perfectly, as evolutionists claim, but God, the Lord of infinite might and knowledge, Who gives them that ability. 
Like areas contaminated with radioactivity and deep space, the depths of the sea are dangerous places for human beings. 
A threeyearold child can manage to regain balance with no difficulty, yet robots lacking this ability are, of necessity, stationary and of very little use. 
Snakes’ properties inspired for a new robotic, interplanetary probe developed by NASA's Ames Research Center which they called the "snakebot." 
This center of balance in the inner ear, known as the labyrinth, consists of three small semicircular canals. 
Thus the three canals combine their results and give the ability to sense rotations in any direction in threedimensional space. 
These signals produced in the inner ear are transmitted by means of nerves to the cerebellum at the back of our brain. 
Totally flawless, our balance system functions by means of several very complex mechanisms, all interconnected and working together. 
Before developing their robot, the researchers spent a long time observing the movements of live scorpions using highspeed cameras, and analyzed the video data.107 Later, the coordination and organization of the scorpion’s legs were used as a starting point for the model’s creation. 
At the front, the robot has two ultrasonic sensors. 
The robot can be asked to go to a specific region and, with a camera in its tail, send back to base images of the location. 
As he describes it, the project’s “technical goal is to capture the performance advantages that the animal systems hold in the target environment.”110 
Mimi A. R. Koehl, a professor of integrative biology in the College of Letters & Science at University of California, Berkeley, says: 
On the outer edge of one of the split ends of its antennules are hairs resembling a brush—a region particularly sensitive to chemicals. 
Tests have shown that if the antennules moved more slowly, the water would not flow between the hairs, reducing the crustacean’s ability to smell. 
Geckolike robots could be used to repair cracks in ships, bridges and piers, and in the regular maintenance of satellites.121 
These personnel need the right materials and the facilities in which to make use of them. 
Indeed, the history of those advances we describe as “technological” is by no means a long one. 
Many of our best inventions are copied from, or already in use by, other living things. 
They could provide new medicines, building materials, ways of controlling pests and dealing with pollution.123 
Even the simplest industrial product has a designer and place where it was manufactured. 
Some flowering plants even do this in cloudy weather, in order—scientists believe—to protect their pollen from dew and approaching rain. 
In these birds, heated and chilled blood circulate in different blood vessels, but these vessels run close together, however. 
Can Plants Use an Electrical Switch? 
The instant one is touched, it gives off electrical signals that change the water balance in the plant’s cells, and trigger the flow of water out of cells along the leaf midrib, closing the trap.129 
Were it not present, then the electrical signals would leak away into the surrounding tissues, either garbling the message or damaging the body.132 
Prairie Dogs’ Ventilation Technology 
A series of chemical processes turn logs of wood into a kind of pulp that can later be made into paper. 
However, the natural inventors of paper are actually wasps. 
The Qur’an describes in these terms the impeccable nature of our Lord’s artistry: 
Darwinism, in other words the theory of evolution, was put forward with the aim of denying the fact of creation, but is in truth nothing but failed, unscientific nonsense. 
The first evolutionist who took up the subject of the origin of life in the twentieth century was the renowned Russian biologist Alexander Oparin. 
With various theses he advanced in the 1930s, he tried to prove that a living cell could originate by coincidence. 
After a long silence, Miller confessed that the atmosphere medium he used was unrealistic.140 
What has become of our ladder if there are three coexisting lineages of hominids (A. africanus, the robust australopithecines, and H. habilis), none clearly derived from another? 
Let them add in this mixture as many amino acids and as many proteins – a single one of which has a formation probability of 10950 – as they like. 
The theory of evolution, which claims the opposite, is a total fallacy completely contrary to reason. 
Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. 
The information we have presented so far shows us that the theory of evolution is incompatible with scientific findings. 
As explained above, those who believe in the theory of evolution think that a few atoms and molecules thrown into a huge vat could produce thinking, reasoning professors and university students; such scientists as Einstein and Galileo; such artists as Humphrey Bogart, Frank Sinatra and Luciano Pavarotti; as well as antelopes, lemon trees, and carnations. 
Some of these verses are as follows: 
In fact, the Qur'an relates the incident of Prophet Moses (pbuh) and Pharaoh to show that some people who support atheistic philosophies actually influence others by magic. 
When Pharaoh was told about the true religion, he told Prophet Moses (pbuh) to meet with his own magicians. 
When Moses (pbuh) did so, he told them to demonstrate their abilities first. The verses continue: 
18 Billy Goodman, “Mimicking Nature,” Princeton Weekly, FeatureJanuary 28, 1998; http://www.princeton.edu/~cml/html/publicity/PAW19980128/0128feat.htm 
He got up again, and she tugged his hand again. "Daddy?" "What, babe?" 
For a moment Louis was uneasily struck by how adult she looked. 
"Goodbye, Norma," he said and lit a cigarette. 
"I'll see you in a while, old girl." 
Louis slipped an arm around Jud's shoulders, and Norma's brother stood close by on his other side, crowding the mortician and his son into the background. 
After all, if the human body was an envelope to hold the human soulGod's letters to the universeas most churches taught, then the American Eternal coffin was an envelope to hold the human body, and to these husky young cousins or nephews or whatever they were, the past was just a dead letter to be filed away. 
Louis went back to where his daughter was, and they walked to the station wagon together, Louis holding Ellie's arm so she wouldn't slip in her good shoes with the leather soles. 
They were going home at last, the graveside ceremony overactually it was held at the small Mount Hope Chapel; no grave would be dug for Norma until springwhen Ellie suddenly burst into tears. 
"Can we really, Mom?" 
"No," Louis said slowly, "but I'll take him to the vet, if you want." 
The soil of a man's heart is stonier, he thought, and the wind sang its bitter black song, and not so many miles distant, Norma Crandall, who had once knitted his daughter and son matching caps, lay in her gray steel American Eternal coffin on a stone slab in a Mount Hope crypt; by now the white cotton the mortician would have used to stuff her cheeks would be turning black. 
Strong grief becomes a softer, more mellow grief; mellow grief becomes mourning; mourning at last becomes remembrancea process that may take from six months to three years and still be considered normal. 
He had, by God! 
He had bought it in the depths of midFebruary, when his soul had cried out for some hope. "Lat?" 
Gage watched, interested, as Louis unfurled the Vulture, which spread its wings over perhaps five feet of tough plastic. 
God, that was horrible. 
"Look at that Vulture, Gage! 
The sun sailed out from behind a fat gray spring cloud, and the temperature seemed to go up five degrees almost at once. 
Louis wound kite string twice around Gage's hand and now he did look down, comically amazed at the strong tug and pull. 
That night Gage ate an enormous supper of hot dogs and beans, and while Rachel was dressing him in his Dr. Dentons for bed, Louis took Ellie aside and had a hearttoheart talk with her about leaving her marbles around. 
"Right up to the sky, my man." 
"Up to the kye." 
"Did Gage fall out of his crib?" "He's fine, honey. 
Of course it was irrational. 
Louis disentangled him, pulled the blankets up, and then merely stood there, watching his son, for a long time. 
It was well for Louiswell for all three of the remaining family membersthat Steve had shown up as promptly as he had, because Louis was at least temporarily unable to make any kind of decision, even one so minor as giving his wife a shot to mute her deep grief. 
Her hair was uncombed, unwashed, tangled. 
She sat at the breakfast table that morning, munching unbuttered toast and talking in disjointed phrases that made no sense at all. 
"The shot will have worn off by then. 
Louis had thrown himself forward in a long flying tackle, his shadow tracking the ground beneath him as the shadow of the Vulture had tracked the white latewinter grass of Mrs. Vinton's field that day in March, and he believed that the tips of his fingers had actually brushed the back of the light jacket Gage had been wearing, and then Gage's forward motion had carried him out into the road, and the truck had been thunder, the truck had been sunlight on high chrome, the truck had been the deepthroated, shrieking bellow of an air horn, and that had been Saturday, that had been three days ago. 
The old man swore at him in Yiddish and banged the phone down at his end, breaking the connection. 
She looked toward Steve. 
At the front, in an area that seemed a combination nave and bower, was Cage's coffin. 
He turned the book back to its cover, which, like the cover to the MY WEDDING DAY book, was imitation leather. 
It was Missy's woeful, heartbroken eyes that drove the laughter away. "Missy, would you sign the book?" he asked her, and because something else seemed to be needed, he added, "For Rachel." 
People were coming out of their houses and I went on screaming his name, Missy, and at the fiftyyard line there was his jumper, it was turned insideout, and on the seventyyard line there was the other sneaker, and then there was Gage. 
Abruptly the world went dove gray. 
Then he followed his wife hurriedly down the aisle for the ritual examination of a coffin which had been made in Storyville, Ohio, a place where Gage had never been and where he was not known. 
Today he looked a graven and composed seventy. 
Dory walked beside him, her face all but invisible under twopossibly threelayers of heavy black netting. 
You didn't sign the book, Louis thought, and then a silent belch of such malignantly acidic content rose through his digestive works that his face clenched in pain. 
Jud answered and asked him how it had gone. 
Louis picked at his chicken and drank a lot of Schlitz beer. 
Over coffee Rachel said something so suddenly and so baldly that it rather shocked them allparticularly Louis, who at last was becoming sleepy with the beer. 
"There's a lot of wear in them yet. 
There was a queer moment then. 
He wanted to do it. 
Suddenly and with no rime or reason. 
He was unsteady on his feet. 
It was a sickening feeling, reallysquashing a slug with your fist might feel something like that. 
Beneath the flesh of his fatherinlaw's lips he could feel the stern, unyielding regularity of his dentures. 
He put his hands down on the rug runner to keep from going flop on his belly. 
He bit his tongue. 
One of the trestle supports had fallen over; the other leaned with drunken casualness against the low dais where a minister might stand to offer a eulogy. 
Water from the overturned vases trickled. 
What sort of shit was that? 
Louis smiled back. 
"Come on then." 
Louis sat down beside her and said, "I want you to know, Ellie, that if we keep on loving each other, we can get through this." 
"I've got his picture, and I'm going to sit in his chair" "Ellie, you're too big for Gage's chair," Louis said, taking her hot, feverish hand. 
Maybe when Gage's chair broke, she would begin to understand what had happened a little better. 
Last winter. When things had been okay. 
When things had been okay. 
It was funny, how quickly and easily your mind made that crucial division. 
The cat did not come too close; Louis had perhaps kicked it too many times. "Nothing for you," he told the cat. 
The cat was reclining on the rug by the TV stand, watching Louis carefully, probably ready to run if Louis should suddenly become aggressive and decide to put his kickingfoot in gear. 
The thought came so naturally that it surely must have been there all along, simply waiting its time to come forward from the back of his mind: When are you going to do it? 
A chill of such elemental force struck him that Louis clutched himself as the shudder twisted through his body. 
And he suspected now that the reason he had gotten drunk was so he could consider this crazy idea soberly. 
These are secret things, Louis ... the soil of a man's heart is stonier... like the soil up in the old Micmac burying ground. 
A man grows what he can... and he tends it. 
Oh, do not ask what is it; let us go and make our visit. 
"Tell you what," Louis said. "It's late and I've been drinking a pile of beer." 
He struck another around cupped hands, but the hands trembled and betrayed the match to the wind again. 
I know about the Micmacs, and that place was always considered to be a kind of holy place to them... but not in a good way. 
Now the Micmacs, the state of Maine, and the government of the United States are arguing in court about who owns that land. 
Not anymore. 
Different people laid claim to it at one time or another, but no claim ever stuck. 
I came over here tonight to tell you about Timmy Baterman and his dad." 
And he'd decided what he wanted to do." 
"The only one to ever try it? I doubt that, Louis. 
"I didn't ask him which you bought." 
"Not right out, maybe." 
"I know you were thinking about Gage. 
Your uncle was an undertaker." 
"But I wasn't thinking about about what you think I was thinking about." "Louis" "It's late," Louis said. 
His body was shipped home two days later, and it got to Limestone on the nineteenth. 
That's what scared me so. 
Missus Strattonwell, we called her `missus,' but so far as anyone knew she could have been single or divorced or grasswidowed; she had a little tworoom house down where the Pedersen Road joins the Hancock Road, and she had a lot of jazz records, and sometimes she'd be willing to throw you a little party if you had a tendollar bill that wasn't working too hard. 
"You know, they have these stories and these moviesI don't know if they're trueabout zombies down in Haiti. 
There was somethin goin on behind his eyes, and sometimes you could see it and sometimes you couldn't see it. 
If it was just one fellow who had written one letter, they'd laugh it off. 
"This Kinsman is going to send a fellow out or come himself if this don't settle down,' Hannibal finishes up. `They want to know if Timmy's dead, or AWOL, or what because they don't like to think their records are all at sixes and sevens. 
You got to get this taken care of. 
I had a call from the goddam War Department, Bill. 
I got my boy. 
Louis was feeling sick to his stomach. 
I saw Alan Purinton put a hand up to cover his nose and mouth. 
Or pay some woman to do the things a man can't bring himself to ask his wife to do. Men keep their gardens too, Louis. 
The tears of the old are singularly unlovely, Louis thought. 
"He told us only the bad," he said after a moment. 
It was only the bad it wanted us to remember because it was bad .. and because it knew we meant danger for it. 
But they was dead beforehand. 
Then he sat down in his easy chair by the radio, flicked a match, and ate the barrel of that Colt .45." 
It has a power you'll beware of if you know what's good for your family and what's good for you. 
I wasn't strong enough to fight it. 
I am saying I may have murdered your son with good intentions, Louis." "I don't believe it," Louis said at last, shakily. 
I don't plan to go up there to the Pet Sematary or beyond it ever again." "Promise me!" Jud said harshly. 
Now Gage was running down the gentle slope of lawn that merged with the soft shoulder of Route 15, his husky little legs pumping, and by all the rights of the world he should have fallen over sprawling but he just kept going and now the sound of the truck was very loud indeed, it was that low, snoring sound that Louis sometimes heard from his bed as he floated just beyond the rim of sleep. 
Tattered clouds still moved overhead, and most of the mourners arrived carrying black umbrellas provided by the undertaker. 
At Rachel's request, the funeral director, who officiated at the short, nonsectarian graveside service, read the passage from Matthew which begins "Suffer the little children to come unto Me." 
Louis, standing on one side of the grave, looked across at his fatherinlaw. 
Louis looked at this, pondering it. He continued to look at it even after the funeral director said, "Let us bow our heads for a moment of silent prayer." 
And, when the funeral was over, Oz would crush his cigarette on the heel of his tewwible workboot, put it in whatever container he carried around with him (in a cemetery, sextons caught depositing their butts on the ground were almost always summarily firedit looked bad; too many of the clientele had died of lung cancer), jump in the payloader, fire that sucker up, and cut his son off from the sun forever ... or at least until the day of the Resurrection. 
"You pullin him on a sled. 
Bet he liked that, didn't he, Ellie?" 
"Where you going, Lou?" Rachel asked. 
She spoke without much interest. 
"Didn't you get enough to eat earlier?" 
Louis received condolences. 
He stretched his hand out to the gate, thinking, They'll be locked, but they were not. 
A fine and private place, he thought, but none, I think, do there embrace. 
Jud's voice spoke up in his mind then, worried andfrightened? 
And second, did it make a difference? 
That was a more difficult question, and he was wary of it because he didn't want to believe it, and he had seen the results of that sort of mindset before. 
Muddled... that's the best word of all, that sums it up. 
Did he believe these things could not be dealt With? 
Louis ate one piece and then tossed the rest out the window, box and all, as he headed back to Ludlow. 
Timmy was burieddon't hold me to this, but I think it was July twentysecond. 
Some part of himself felt shame at this cheap victory. All the textbooks he'd read on the subject of death told him that the bereaved's first strong impulse is to get away from the place where it happened ... and that to succumb to such an impulse may turn out to be the most harmful course of action because it allows the bereaved the dubious luxury of refusing to come to terms with the new reality. 
It was just a game to him... the truck came at the wrong time... and Missy Dandridge called while I was still crying... and said she read in the Ellsworth American that the driver tried to kill himself." 
"My boy's dead and he's out on a thousand dollars' bail and he'll go on feeling depressed and suicidal until some judge takes away his license for ninety days and gives him a slaponthewrist fine." "Missy says his wife has taken the kids and left him," Rachel said dully. 
"I'll follow you in three daysfour at the most." If things went well, Rachel and Ellie might be back here in fortyeight hours. "I've got to find someone to fill in for me, on a parttime basis, at least, at the university. 
He looked at her openly, clearly. 
It meant that Rachel and Ellie would be able to travel with the Goldmans only as far as Cincinnati, but they would get to Chicago less than an hour after. 
"All right, take a couple of tote bags too. 
"Rachel, don't," he said. "Don't cry." 
My God, I think I just wet my pants! 
Thanks to a stupid, bullheaded old man. 
Stupid, but not that stupid. You think I'm saying all of this because now I can, you're thinking oh yeah, he's getting what he wants and once he tried to buy me off, but ... but Louis, I swear..." 
"I can't... I really can't take any more." 
"All right," Goldman said and sighed. 
Louis thought it was a sigh of relief. 
He shut the voice up briskly. "Irwin, I ought to go now. 
"Goodbye, Irwin," he said and hung up the phone. 
"For God's sake, hon, what is this?" 
"I don't know. 
"Of Zeida," she said simply. 
He hesitated, not wanting to cause her even more pain but needing to know. 
By the time Gage was nine months old, Louis had become deeply concerned about his son's cranial size. 
It was right off Louis's Berterier Chart, which showed the normal range of infant head sizes on a permonth basis. 
"He seems normal to me," she said. 
Gage held it for a while and then dropped it. 
The new shunt operation should take care of the problem easily ... if there is a problem." 
Gage spent a night in Our Sisters of Charity Hospital and underwent general anesthesia. His sleeping head was stuck into a gadget that looked like a giant clothes dryer. 
Rachel and Louis waited downstairs while Ellie spent the day at Grandma and Grandda's, watching "Sesame Street" nonstop on Grandda's new video recorder. 
Louis, why do you ask?" 
A long time later she said drowsily, "You're right, Louis .. just dreams and vapors..." 
They went upstairs on the escalator and sat in the boarding lounge, not talking much. 
Louis didn't like it. It made him nervous. "Will you be good at Grandma and Grandda's?" he asked her as they walked over. 
"I'll take care of the school, and you can start again in the fall with no trouble." 
I don't know what kids do in grades. Homework, probably." "You'll be fine." 
The hairs at the nape of his neck stirred. 
I just want to go back to school. 
"Thanks." 
Anything else for you today?" 
If Gage returned, the single path forked into two possibilities. 
And if the loss is too greator if he comes back as Timmy Baterman apparently came back, as a thing of evili will kill him. 
Neither Rachel nor Ellie would ever need to know about his failed experiment. 
Then, looking along the other paththe path he hoped for blindly with all his love for his son: he and Gage would leave the house when the examination period was over, would leave at night. 
This minute. 
Gage has got the knife from Daddy's bag! 
Wild work, he thought stupidly and got up. 
They moved across the lobby toward the luggage carousels, and Rachel saw her mother and father waiting there for them. 
"Oh, God," Rachel said despairingly and took her by the hand. 
"Rachel, shall I corner' Dory called. 
A bolt of terror both sharp and yet undefined struck her. 
"Honey," Rachel said, "I think you dreamed about the Pet Sematary because you're still thinking about Gage. And I'm sure Daddy is fine. 
She felt somethingsomething pregnant, swollen, and waiting to burst. Something terrible that needed to be averted. 
"He was wearing red shorts in my dream. 
"Did the man in your dream tell you his first name, Eileen?" 
Ellie drew sharp breath. 
How bad is this? 
Or some kid mentioned it to her at school, and her mind stored it away. 
"Jud, have you seen Louis today?" 
Jud's voice seemed to sharpen a trifle. 
There was something in Jud's voice she didn't like. "Was it his idea that you should go out there?" 
There were absolutely none of the signs, but the house still had an unpleasant blank feel, as if it were waiting to be filled with... well, something. P'raps I ought to take a little run out to Pleasantview Cemetery. 
He pulled a sixpack of beer out of the kitchen fridge and took it into the living room. He sat down in front of the bay window that looked out on the Creed house, cracked a beer, and lit a cigarette. 
The afternoon drew down around him, and as it did so often these last few years, he found his mind turning back and back in a widening gyre. 
He did not put on the light. 
While Jud Crandall was sitting in the ladderbacked rocker and watching for him out of his bay window, Louis was eating a big tasteless dinner in the Howard Johnson's dining room. 
He could see no stars but had a sense of clouds rushing past overhead at high speed. 
Then he turned back and went up to his room and turned on the television. 
It was too early to do anything serious, and that nightwind was too full of possibilities. 
It made him nervous. 
In Ludlow, Jud Crandall sat by his bay window, smoking and drinking beer, motionless, examining the mental scrapbook of his own past and waiting for Louis to come home. 
Could I stop even if I wanted to? 
Rachel and Ellie `had done no more than pick at their dinners. 
"Honey, I believe that it is. 
But you could help me if you could tell me more. 
Rachel hung up at last, limp but relieved. 
"Daddy, will you drive me to the airport?" 
Maybe you could shinny up to the top of that fence, but it would take a trained gymnast to swing over those points without sticking himself on them. 
He pressed himself tight against the tree, the rough bark against his cheek, hoping madly that it was big enough to shield him. 
The spotlight reached the tree, disappeared for a moment, and then reappeared on Louis's right. 
Come out NOW! 
The police car kept on going. 
Louis found himself glancing up at the tree he had hidden behind. 
Breathing fast, not quite gasping, he groped for the fence points with his feet, needing a moment's rest. 
One knee thudded against a gravestone, sending a lance of pain up his thigh. 
Too late now. 
He sat down behind a large grave markerit hurt his knee too much to squatand watched a couple walk up the far side of Mason Street. 
It was there, and Louis drew it gratefully around him. When the couple finally walked on, Louis watched them with nothing but impatience. 
He could see these things but could not integrate them into a coherent whole. 
He nodded his head almost imperceptibly and fished for his pocketknife. 
Uncle Carl had told him that was the nickname for every graveyard sexton in America. Their friends called them Digger. 
Your last chance. 
Going to break you out, Gage, see if 1 don't! 
When the rubbery feeling had left his legs, he sat up and slipped back down into the grave. 
Louis slipped the flashlight into his armpit. 
If you'd been even four minutes sooner" She walked away, not listening to the rest. She was halfway back to the security checkpoint when waves of faintness rode over her. 
She walked back toward the terminal. 
He threw up on the far side of the grave and then put his head against the ground, panting. 
By quarter of two, Louis was ready to leave the cemetery. Actually handling the body had been the worst of itthat was the point at which that interior astronaut, his mind, seemed to float the farthest into the void. 
He put Gage's body on the tarpaulin and wrapped it up. 
He closed the coffin and then lowered half of the cement graveliner top. 
There was not enough dirt to bring it up even with the ground again. The grave's swaybacked look might be noticed. 
Here, looming in the windy dark, was the cemetery's crypt. 
There were such rushes of "cold custom" from time to time, Louis knew; in any given population there were times when, for no reason anyone could understand, lots of people died. 
People get tired in February. 
The crypt's double doors were set into a grassy rise of hill, a shape as natural and attractive as the swell of a woman's breast. This hill (which Louis suspected was landscaped rather than natural) crested only a foot or two below the decorative arrow tips of the wroughtiron fence, which remained even at the top rather than rising with the contour. 
The new digital watch Rachel had given him for Christmas informed him that it was now 2:01. 
He gave himself five minutes to regroup and then tossed the shovel over the fence. He heard it thud in the grass. 
He skidded down, digging in at the earth between the staves of the fence with the toes of his shoes, and dropped to the ground. He made his way down the far side of the hill and felt through the grass. 
He crossed the street rapidly, heels clicking. 
Now wait, wait just a goddam minute. 
He had gotten twenty or thirty feet down the sidewalk when he remembered his keys. 
It began to howl, its gruff voice filling the street. 
There were people all around him, hundreds of eyes, and that dog was attacking sleep, his only friend. 
He could have bent and crushed the bundle in thereGage would not have mindedbut Louis could simply not bring himself to do it. 
It's Gage in there, not a bundle of towels! 
He reached over and gently began to press his hands against the canvas tarpaulin, feeling for the contours underneath. 
At one o'clock that morning, Jud Crandall's telephone rang, shrilling in the empty house, starting him awake. 
That's no way to run this railroad... not tonight. 
It was like spun glass, fine and fragile. 
I imagine Louis will be real glad to see you." 
"Tell me what's going on! 
"You promise you'll tell me the whole story?" "Yes. 
Yeah, I feel that. 
Gage in his arms. 
The pick and shovel rattled and clinked dully against his back. 
The sound held no terror for him now. 
She should never have allowed Louis to bulldoze her out of the house the way he had, but she had been weakened by Gage's death. 
The Chevette's speedometer needle hung poised just a bit to the right of sixty miles an hour. A mile a minute. Two hours and a quarter to Ludlow maybe. 
She fumbled with the radio, turned it on, found a rockandroll station out of Portland. 
He accepted the ability of the Micmac burying ground to resurrect the dead and walked into Little God Swamp with his son in his arms, not looking down or back. 
The voiceif that was what it wascame again, this time from the left. 
You might see St. Elmo's fire, what the sailors call foolights. 
It can make funny shapes, but it's nothing. 
If you should see some of those shapes and they bother you, just look the other way. 
You could look around and see something that would send you raving mad. 
He became aware that he was moaning (oh my God oh my dear God what is that what is coming through this fog?) and once more clutching Gage to his chest; he became aware that the peepers and frogs had fallen silent, he became aware that the wet, damp air had taken on an eldritch, sickening smell like warm, spoiled pork. 
His mind tolled off the steps as he rose into the chill, as he climbed back into that ceaseless river of wind, stronger now, rippling his clothes, making the piece of canvas tarp Gage was wrapped in stutter gunshot sounds like a lifted sail. 
There were no constellations he recognized, and he looked away again, disturbed. 
It didn't matter. 
It was just like the Pet Sematary. 
But there were no real cairns, Louis saw; every one of them had been burst apart as something buried beneath returned to life... and clawed its way out. 
Louis wondered randomly and thought of those desert drawings that one tribe of Indians or another had made in South America. 
Has anyone ever seen it from the air, and if they did, what did they think, I wonder? 
Besides, he gibbered to himself, it may still come out all right; there is no gain without risk, perhaps no risk without love. 
His thoughts dissolved into the inarticulate, droning mutter of prayer even as his hands groped for the pick ... and still on his knees, Louis began to dig into the earth. 
She tried to laughbut she couldn't. 
Poor guy finds forward motion harder and harder, until at last the potential energy of the rubber band equalizes the actual energy of the runner ... inertia becomes what? ... elementary physics... something trying to hold her back... stay out of this, you... and a body at rest tends to remain at rest ... Gage's body, for instance ... once set in motion. 
For a moment he surveyed his surroundings, visible by starlight. 
Nearby was the grave of SMUCKY. 
The wind still blew strongly, and he could hear the faint tingtingting of a piece of metalperhaps it had once been a Del Monte can, cut laboriously by a grieving pet owner with his father's tinsnips and then flattened out with a hammer and nailed to a stickand that brought the fear back again. 
He was too tired now to feel it as more than a somehow sickening pulsebeat. He had done it. That steady tingtingting sound coming out of the darkness brought it home to him more than anything else. 
On the other side of the deadfall, those sounds had begun again. 
Almostbut not quitehidden under the wind. 
He went through the kitchen without turning on a light and stepped into the small bathroom between the kitchen and the dining room. 
He remembered that very clearly. 
He reached out a hand to stroke Church, wanting some sort of comfort, but the cat leaped down from the toilet tank, staggering in that drunken and weirdly unfeline way, and left for some other place. 
He took this into the master bedroom, sat down, and began to rummage through it. 
Louis snapped the bag shut and put it by the bed. 
There was death in a quarter bag of peanuts, an aspirated piece of steak, the next pack of cigarettes. 
Phone call in the middle of the night. 
Big handfuls of pills, munch em up. 
We cruise... my son and I... because the essence of it isn't war or sex but only that sickening, noble, hopeless battle against Oz the Gweat and Tewwible. 
Then it came inside. 
Co down and get it quickly, and wish our boy alive again."w. w. JACOBS ("The Monkey's Paw") Jud Crandall came awake with a sudden jerk, almost falling out of his chair. 
He looked at his watch and saw that it was five minutes of five. 
Jud's eye followed it for a moment and then he looked up again. 
Jud raised the cleaver. 
I saw her there, Jud. 
I saw her there." 
Skin peeled off like parchment in his hand. 
Long enough for what? 
That was stupid. 
Somewhere a bird sang and then was silent. 
A child's tracks, by the look of them. 
"Church?" she asked, startled and puzzled. She bent forward, but it was of course impossible to see in; the door's glass panel had been covered with a neat white curtain. 
He was wrong about that, anyway; Church still hunts. 
How did he get in, anyway? 
But it was Zelda, all right, her eyes alight with an insane glee, her face a raddled purple; it was Zelda screaming, "I finally came back for you, Rachel, I'm going to twist your back like mine and you'll never get out of bed again never get out of bed again NEVER GET OUT OF BED AGAIN" Church was perched on one of her shoulders and Zelda's face swam and changed, and Rachel saw with spiraling, sickening horror that it really wasn't Zelda at allhow could she have made such a stupid mistake? 
"I brought you something, Mommy!" he screamed. 
So a strange vehicle over there could mean trouble, that was so what. 
He looked for a long time before letting the curtain go. 
He had dreamed about the thing in the woods last night. 
It was the Wendigo, and it had turned him into not just a cannibal but the father of cannibals. 
A couple of friedegg sandwiches with mayo and a slice of Bermuda onion on each one. 
He tried to whistlea whistle would bring the morning into its proper focusbut he could not. 
He did not answer it immediately but turned and looked at it, feeling slow and stupid, a sucker in some game which he was only now realizing he did not understand in the least. 
"Hello, Irwin," he said, and already he knew what Irwin was going to say. 
"She said Oz the Great and Terrible had killed her mother. 
Louis regarded the dirt under his nails, which was so like the dirt which comprised those footprints on the kitchen floor. 
"We did the best we could," Goldman said. 
Goldman's reply was like the toll of a funeral bell against the wall of his heart. 
It was the sight of those muddy footprints on the kitchen floor. 
There would come a day when he would open a door and there would be Gage, a demented parody of his former self, grinning a sunken grin, his clear blue eyes gone yellow and smartstupid. 
Gage was still out there. 
A young married couple perhaps, with no children (but with hopes and plans). 
Louis smiled and stepped away from the car. 
He put the multidose vial back in his jacket and walked over to Church, who looked around again mistrustfully. 
Heyho, let's go, right?" 
Church went electric in his grip, struggling against him, spitting and clawing, but Louis held on and depressed the plunger all the way. 
Cool and dark. 
Louis threw another. 
The muddy tracks approached the chair by the window. 
As if Church had walked in and out of the gravedirt left by Gage's small shoes. Then the tracks made for the swinging door leading into the kitchen. Heart thudding, Louis followed the tracks. 
He pushed the door open and saw Jud's splayed feet, his old green workpants, his checked flannel shirt. 
Almost immediately, tiny rosepetals of deepest, darkest scarlet began to stain the white lawn. "I'm sorry," he said for a third time. 
"So sor" Then something moved overhead, something scraped, and the word broke off between his lips. 
Oh yes, he was convinced of that. 
His hands wanted to tremble, but he would not allow them. 
He removed three more multidose vials and filled each of the syringes with enough morphine to kill a horseor Hanratty the bull, if it came to that. 
She looked like a woman who has gone to sleep while reading in bed. 
Blood had splashed the wallpaper in idiot shapes. 
Something had been... something had been at her. (! 
It screamed beneath him, body straining and sunfishing, nearly throwing him off. 
Ten steps and that strange yellow light in its eyes began to fade. A dozen and it fell to its knees. 
He was then a doctor for the last time in his life, monitoring the pulse, monitoring until there was nothing, nothing inside, nothing outside. 
The blast of the heat was immediate and savage, making the skin on his neck feel too small. 
Steve Masterton came around the curve just before Louis's house and saw the smoke immediatelynot from Louis's place, but from the house that belonged to the old duck across the street. 
Stupid, of course, but in the pit of his stomach there was a feeling similar to the one he'd had there last fall when that Pascow thing cropped upa feeling of miserable surprise and almost leaden disillusion. 
Louis was the man you came out to see, remember? 
You didn't come out to Ludlow to go exploring the goddam woods. "What you got there, Randy?" the wouldbe hero cried. 
His gaze was fixed on the bizarre sight at the far side of the circular clearing. 
This close, its configuration was undeniableit was a body. 
He'll fall, Steve thought incoherently. 
Good Christ, what happened? 
If you just move steadily and don't look down. 
As he did so, a crazy daredevil exhilaration swept over himit was like hitting on pure oxygen. 
Then a branch snapped under one of his canted feet. 
Pulling him toward that place where Louis was taking Rachel. 
Come on, walk the path... walk the path and see where It goes. 
We got stuff to show you out here, Steverino, stuff they never told you about in the Atheists' Society back in Lake Forest. 
He fell forward into the Pet Sematary, barely missing a piece of orange crate that could easily have punched into his stomach. 
Something with great yellow eyes which gleamed like foglamps. 
EPILOGUE The police came late that afternoon. 
The ashes were still hot; they had not yet been raked. Louis answered their questions. 
All forms of immorality, fraud, and degeneration will end. 
According to one hadith, people will be so content that they will spend their days with no idea as to how time passes and how one day turns into the next. They will pray to Allah to prolong their lives in order to receive more benefits from these graces. 
In the last of times there will be a khalifa (successor) who will distribute wealth without even counting it.3 
A person will scatter a few handfuls of seeds, but will reap 700 handfuls … Despite an abundance of rain, not a drop will go to waste.9 
This hadith refers to an increase in agricultural production that will occur in the End Times by transitioning to modern agriculture, developing new production techniques, improving seed stocks, and using rainwater more efficiently by constructing new dams and ponds. 
The Improvement of Crops 
A plant's level of protein or vitamin can be increased by injecting DNA pieces into its cells. 
Food that is treated according to such methods become durable and carries no risk of food poisoning. 
Such technological developments, which are still at a very early stage, have only limited applications today. However, they will be very effective in maintaining the land's abundance in the End Times. 
Nations that are far from one another, as well as societies of dissimilar cultures, will benefit from these sources evenly, and everyone will enjoy a just administration. 
The just administration of sincere Muslims, who turn to Allah for every deed they perform, will secure peace and security, as well as continued blessings. 
Purifying and then using all forms of water are also important for desert agriculture. 
Allah makes an example of a city that was safe and at peace, its provision coming to it plentifully from every side. Then it showed ingratitude for Allah's blessings, so Allah made it wear the robes of hunger and fear for what it did. 
Current developments provide important signs regarding the technological advances from which people will benefit in the Golden Age. 
More efficient learning systems, which will rely on gaining personal experience through virtual reality technologies or the Internet, will replace the classical education methods, which are based on memorization. 
Thanks to this technology, pilot training, for instance, has become safe. In the Golden Age, these technologies will be applied from business and planning to manufacturing and entertainment, and to many diverse business domains. 
As a result, comprehensive information collection that used to take long years of research can now be done with a minimum of effort. 
At no time in human history has the world witnessed such rapid development. 
In the coming 50 years, the world's population is expected to double and energy consumption to triple. Meanwhile, according to the best estimations, available oil reserves will meet humanity's needs for no longer than a century. 
The solar energy received over a 20day period equals the world's total energy reserves. 
The Qur'an invites people to ponder so as to see the signs of Allah encompassing them. 
This is the only way to appreciate Allah's superior wisdom and power, which He manifests in living beings. 
He Who created the seven heavens in layers. 
These very developments, which flourish wherever people live according to the real spirit of the Qur'an's moral teachings, will be evident in the Golden Age, a time of unprecedented scientific development. 
One goal of the Human Genome Project, originally planned to last for 15 years and being worked upon by thousands of scientists from more than eight countries, is to identify the genes in human DNA and thereby uncover its mysteries. 
People guided by the Qur'an's values consider human life to be very precious. 
In a society of believers, therefore, people pay great attention to issues related to human health. Regardless of their status or qualities, anyone, whether rich or poor, young or old, will receive the treatment he or she deserves. 
Now, a single intense jolt can reduce an entire city to heaps of rubble. In the Golden Age, however, both the construction systems and materials will, by Allah's Will, help buildings withstand intense shakes. 
The congestion, pollution, and chaos dominating our contemporary urban areas results from our distance from the Qur'an's concept of morality. 
Being Inspired by the Surrounding Beauties 
However, only the believers who strive to see the divine purposes in these things can see the beauty in them. 
Indeed, the impact of the palace's splendor on the Queen of Saba is related in the Qur'an as follows: 
But very few of My servants are thankful. 
In the Qur'anic sense, art cannot be confined to music, literature, and painting, for art fills every field of life with its own vigor. 
In the Golden Age, all places (e. g., highways, places of worship, recreational places, workplaces, and houses) will be very clean. 
Vessels of silver and goblets of pure crystal will be passed round among them, crystalline silver—they have measured them very exactly. 
But they were only given a simulation of it. 
How many gardens and fountains they left behind, and ripe crops and noble residences. 
The truly good will drink from a cup mixed with the coolness of camphor. 
Platters and cups of gold will be passed around among them, and they will have there all that their hearts desire and all in which their eyes find delight. 
There will circulate among them ageless youths carrying goblets and decanters and a cup from a flowing spring—it does not give them any headache nor does it leave them stupefied. 
Is that like those who will be in the Fire timelessly, forever, with boiling water to drink, which lacerates their bowels? 
Allah describes such people as follows: 
In such societies, family and business life, politics, and human relations undergo rapid degeneration, for a life devoid of fear and consciousness of Allah sees no rules or limits. 
When they make unjust gains or attempt to achieve wealth through plunder, they see the plight of those who suffer from the consequences of this process, and yet are not moved by such people's misery. 
In this blessed period that is coming closer, there will be morally excellent people who will exercise justice, live by the letter and the spirit of the Qur'an's values, and communicate them to people. 
He [the Mahdi] will distribute wealth evenly among people. 
O you who believe, be upholders of justice, bearing witness for Allah alone, even against yourselves or your parents and relatives. 
In the Golden Age, people will comply scrupulously with each Qur’anic verse and thereby bring about a Paradiselike environment of peace and security. 
He warns you so that hopefully you will pay heed. 
That is closer to heedfulness… (Surat alMa’ida: 8) 
You will not attain true goodness until you give of what you love. 
The ignorant consider them rich because of their reticence. 
They do not ask from people insistently. 
But making a free gift of it would be better for you, if you only knew. 
Allah is aware of what you do. 
Those who do good will have the best and more! 
Eat and drink of Allah’s provision, and do not go about the land corrupting it. 
Allah’s mercy is close to the gooddoers. 
He will eliminate the sects from the face of the earth. 
In our own time, Muslims fail to agree even on some fundamental issues. 
In this way We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’an, and have diversified therein the warnings so that hopefully they will avoid sin or it will spur them into remembrance. (Surah Ta Ha: 113) 
Allah warns those who proclaim their own laws on behalf of religion as follows: 
Do not say about what your lying tongues describe: “This is lawful and this is unlawful,” inventing lies against Allah. 
In this section, we will examine these three basic points in general outlines: The First Insurmountable Step: The Origin of Life The theory of evolution posits that all living species evolved from a single living cell that emerged on the primitive Earth 3.8 billion years ago. 
The Complex Structure of Life 
If such animals ever really existed, there should be millions and even billions of them in number and variety. More importantly, the remains of these strange creatures should be present in the fossil record. In The Origin of Species, Darwin explained: 
This is just the opposite of Darwin's assumptions. 
Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 
Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. 
In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there. As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. 
This is why Darwinistmaterialists, who believe that everything is comprised of matter, cannot answer these questions. 
This is how many ideas, such as the Earthcentered universe model, have been taken out of the agenda of science throughout history. 
But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he said. 
Acquired!  Socrates; do you want to know how much I acquired?  In the art of making money I have been midway between my father and grandfather: for my grandfather, whose name I bear, doubled and trebled the value of his patrimony, that which he inherited being much what I possess now; but my father Lysanias reduced the property below what it is at present: and I shall be satisfied if I leave to these my sons not less but a little more than I received. 
Is not Polemarchus your heir?  I said. 
by the analogy of the preceding instances, then justice is the art which gives good to friends and evil to enemies. That is his meaning then? 
Exactly. But is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better partner at a game of draughts? 
You mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to lie? 
That is to say, justice is useful when money is useless? 
And when you want to keep a pruninghook safe, then justice is useful to the individual and to the state; but when you want to use it, then the art of the vinedresser? 
And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is best able to create one? 
And instead of saying simply as we did at first, that it is just to do good to our friends and harm to our enemies, we should further say: 
When horses are injured, are they improved or deteriorated? 
And dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, and not of horses? 
Assuredly not. 
Nor can the good harm any one? 
Most true, he said. Yes, I said; but if this definition of justice also breaks down, what other can be offered? 
And the government is the ruling power in each state? 
A small addition, you must allow, he said. 
Great or small, never mind about that:  we must first enquire whether what you are saying is the truth.  Now we are both agreed that justice is interest of some sort, but you go on to say ‘of the stronger’; about this addition I am not so sure, and must therefore consider further. 
Those were not his words, rejoined Polemarchus. SOCRATESTHRASYMACHUS 
A captain of sailors. 
And how am I to convince you, he said, if you are not already convinced by what I have just said; what more can I do for you?  Would you have me put the proof bodily into your souls? 
Heaven forbid!  I said; I would only ask you to be consistent; or, if you change, change openly and let there be no deception.  For I must remark, Thrasymachus, if you will recall what was previously said, that although you began by defining the true physician in an exact sense, you did not observe a like exactness when speaking of the shepherd; you thought that the shepherd as a shepherd tends the sheep not with a view to their own good, but like a mere diner or banqueter with a view to the pleasures of the table; or, again, as a trader for sale in the market, and not as a shepherd.  Yet surely the art of the shepherd is concerned only with the good of his subjects; he has only to provide the best for them, since the perfection of the art is already ensured whenever all the requirements of it are satisfied.  And that was what I was saying just now about the ruler.  I conceived that the art of the ruler, considered as ruler, whether in a state or in private life, could only regard the good of his flock or subjects; whereas you seem to think that the rulers in states, that is to say, the true rulers, like being in authority. 
Think!  Nay, I am sure of it. 
No, I would rather say sublime simplicity. 
Then I certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the argument so long as I have reason to think that you, Thrasymachus, are speaking your real mind; for I do believe that you are now in earnest and are not amusing yourself at our expense. 
That, I suppose, can hardly be denied. 
And you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like but his unlike? 
But I want to view the matter, Thrasymachus, in a different way: You would not deny that a state may be unjust and may be unjustly attempting to enslave other states, or may have already enslaved them, and may be holding many of them in subjection? 
That is out of civility to you, he replied. 
And this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting, and justice imparts harmony and friendship; is not that true, Thrasymachus? 
Feast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; 
I will not oppose you, lest I should displease the company. 
Let me explain:  Can you see, except with the eye? 
But you can cut off a vinebranch with a dagger or with a chisel, and in many other ways? 
And the ear has an end and an excellence also? 
That is so. 
Well; and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil?  for example, to superintend and command and deliberate and the like.  Are not these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned to any other? 
And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and injustice the defect of the soul? 
That has been admitted. 
And would you not recognize a third class, such as gymnastic, and the care of the sick, and the physician’s art; also the various ways of moneymaking—these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable; and no one would choose them for their own sakes, but only for the sake of some reward or result which flows from them? 
Now, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and unjust, we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the isolation to be effected?  I answer:  Let the unjust man be entirely unjust, and the just man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away from either of them, and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective lives.  First, let the unjust be like other distinguished masters of craft; like the skilful pilot or physician, who knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits, and who, if he fails at any point, is able to recover himself.  So let the unjust make his unjust attempts in the right way, and lie hidden if he means to be great in his injustice (he who is found out is nobody): for the highest reach of injustice is: to be deemed just when you are not.  Therefore I say that in the perfectly unjust man we must assume the most perfect injustice; there is to be no deduction, but we must allow him, while doing the most unjust acts, to have acquired the greatest reputation for justice.  If he have taken a false step he must be able to recover himself; he must be one who can speak with effect, if any of his deeds come to light, and who can force his way where force is required his courage and strength, and command of money and friends.  And at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity, wishing, as Aeschylus says, to be and not to seem good.  There must be no seeming, for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded, and then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards; therefore, let him be clothed in justice only, and have no other covering; and he must be imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former.  Let him be the best of men, and let him be thought the worst; then he will have been put to the proof; and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of infamy and its consequences.  And let him continue thus to the hour of death; being just and seeming to be unjust.  When both have reached the uttermost extreme, the one of justice and the other of injustice, let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two. 
In the first place, he is thought just, and therefore bears rule in the city; he can marry whom he will, and give in marriage to whom he will; also he can trade and deal where he likes, and always to his own advantage, because he has no misgivings about injustice and at every contest, whether in public or private, he gets the better of his antagonists, and gains at their expense, and is rich, and out of his gains he can benefit his friends, and harm his enemies; moreover, he can offer sacrifices, and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and magnificently, and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to honour in a far better style than the just, and therefore he is likely to be dearer than they are to the gods.  And thus, Socrates, gods and men are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life of the just. 
Still grander are the gifts of heaven which Musaeus and his son vouchsafe to the just; they take them down into the world below, where they have the saints lying on couches at a feast, everlastingly drunk, crowned with garlands; their idea seems to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue.  Some extend their rewards yet further; the posterity, as they say, of the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth generation.  This is the style in which they praise justice.  But about the wicked there is another strain; they bury them in a slough in Hades, and make them carry water in a sieve; also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy, and inflict upon them the punishments which Glaucon described as the portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust; nothing else does their invention supply.  Such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the other. 
I will tell you, I replied; justice, which is the subject of our enquiry, is, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual, and sometimes as the virtue of a State. 
When the State is completed there may be a hope that the object of our search will be more easily discovered. Yes, far more easily. 
Then carpenters, and smiths, and many other artisans, will be sharers in our little State, which is already beginning to grow? 
Yes, Socrates, he said, and if you were providing for a city of pigs, how else would you feed the beasts? 
But are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another, and with everybody else? 
Would not he who is fitted to be a guardian, besides the spirited nature, need to have the qualities of a philosopher? 
I do not apprehend your meaning. 
And literature may be either true or false? 
You may find a model of the lesser in the greater, I said; for they are necessarily of the same type, and there is the same spirit in both of them. 
Very likely, he replied; but I do not as yet know what you would term the greater. 
Why, yes, said he, those stories are extremely objectionable. 
And that which is not hurtful hurts not? Certainly not. 
Then God, if he be good, is not the author of all things, as the many assert, but he is the cause of a few things only, and not of most things that occur to men.  For few are the goods of human life, and many are the evils, and the good is to be attributed to God alone; of the evils the causes are to be sought elsewhere, and not in him. 
And the same principle, as I should suppose, applies to all composite things—furniture, houses, garments; when good and well made, they are least altered by time and circumstances. 
If he change at all he can only change for the worse, for we cannot suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty. 
But although the gods are themselves unchangeable, still by witchcraft and deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms? 
But no mad or senseless person can be a friend of God. 
Then no motive can be imagined why God should lie? None whatever. 
Your thoughts, he said, are the reflection of my own. 
You agree with me then, I said, that this is the second type or form in which we should write and speak about divine things.  The gods are not magicians who transform themselves, neither do they deceive mankind in any way. 
And I thought that the word of Phoebus being divine and full of prophecy, would not fail. 
And now he himself who uttered the strain, he who was present at the banquet, and who said this—he it is who has slain my son. 
And for this reason the loss of a son or brother, or the deprivation of fortune, is to him of all men least terrible. 
On my views, if you like to father them on me; that we must not admit them is certain. 
They are ill spoken. 
Indeed, he said, I am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear that sort of thing. 
In the next place, we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers of money. 
Loving Homer as I do, I hardly like to say that in attributing these feelings to Achilles, or in believing that they are truly to him, he is guilty of downright impiety.  As little can I believe 
Verily I would he even with thee, if I had only the power, 
That such things are or are not to be said about men is a question which we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is, and how naturally advantageous to the possessor, whether he seems to be just or not. 
illustration of my meaning.  You know the first lines of the Iliad, in which the poet says that Chryses prayed Agamemnon to release his daughter, and that Agamemnon flew into a passion with him; whereupon Chryses, failing of his object, invoked the anger 
Then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life, and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts as well; for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied, the same persons cannot succeed in both, as, for example, the writers of tragedy and comedy—did you not just now call them imitations? 
Then, I said, we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of whom we say that they ought to be good men, to imitate a woman, whether young or old, quarrelling with her husband, or striving and vaunting against the gods in conceit of her happiness, or when she is in affliction, or sorrow, or weeping; and certainly not one who is in sickness, love, or labour. 
That is quite true, he said. Whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of rhythms, if the music and the style are to correspond, because the style has all sorts of changes. 
I should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue. Yes, I said, Adeimantus, but the mixed style is also very charming: 
Yes, he said; so much as that you may. 
And which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow?  You are musical, and can tell me. 
Utterly unbecoming. And which are the soft or drinking harmonies? The Ionian, he replied, and the Lydian; they are termed ‘relaxed.’ 
And these, he replied, are the Dorian and Phrygian harmonies of which I was just now speaking. Then, I said, if these and these only are to be used in our songs and melodies, we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic scale? 
That is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument. The preferring of Apollo and his instruments to Marsyas and his instruments is not at all strange, I said. 
And we have done wisely, he replied. 
Just so, he said, they should follow the words. 
And everything else on the style? 
And if our youth are to do their work in life, must they not make these graces and harmonies their perpetual aim? 
My meaning may be learned from Homer; he, you know, feeds his heroes at their feasts, when they are campaigning, on soldiers’ fare; they have no fish, although they are on the shores of the Hellespont, and they are not allowed boiled meats but only roast, which is the food most convenient for soldiers, requiring only that they should light a fire, and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans. 
I think not. 
And yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state of education than this, that not only artisans and the meaner sort of people need the skill of firstrate physicians and judges, but also those who would profess to have had a liberal education?  Is it not disgraceful, and a great sign of want of goodbreeding, that a man should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of his own at home, and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men whom he makes lords and judges over him? 
Of that, he replied, there can be no doubt; such excessive care of the body, when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic, is most inimical to the practice of virtue. 
Yes, I replied, and he will be a good man (which is my answer to your question); for he is good who has a good soul.  But the cunning and suspicious nature of which we spoke,he who has committed many crimes, and fancies himself to be a master in wickedness, when he is amongst his fellows, is wonderful in the precautions which he takes, because he judges of them by himself:  but when he gets into the company of men of virtue, who have the experience of age, he appears to be a fool again, owing to his unseasonable suspicions; he cannot recognise an honest man, because he has no pattern of honesty in himself; at the same time, as the bad are more numerous than the good, and he meets with them oftener, he thinks himself, and is by others thought to be, rather wise than foolish. 
And in mine also. 
Did you never observe, I said, the effect on the mind itself of exclusive devotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to music? 
If the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily accomplished, but if he have a good deal, then the power of music weakening the spirit renders him excitable;on the least provocation he flames up at once, and is speedily extinguished; instead of having spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable. 
Those again who are forced are those whom the violence of some pain or grief compels to change their opinion. 
I understand, he said, and you are quite right. 
Nothing new, I replied; only an old Phoenician tale of what has often occurred before now in other places, (as the poets say, and have made the world believe,) though not in our time, and I do not know whether such an event could ever happen again, or could now even be made probable, if it did. 
Well then, I will speak, although I really know not how to look you in the face, or in what words to utter the audacious fiction, which I propose to communicate gradually, first to the rulers, then to the soldiers, and lastly to the people.  They are to be told that their youth was a dream, and the education and training which they received from us, an appearance only; in reality during all that time they were being formed and fed in the womb of the earth, where they themselves and their arms and appurtenances were manufactured; when they were completed, the earth, their mother, sent them up; and so, their country being their mother and also their nurse, they are bound to advise for her good, and to defend her against attacks, and her citizens they are to regard as children of the earth and their own brothers. 
Yes, great care should be taken. And would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard? 
The process is as follows:  When a potter becomes rich, will he, think you, any longer take the same pains with his art? 
Hardly, if they came upon him at once. 
And what, I said, will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when they are considering the size of the State and the amount of territory which they are to include, and beyond which they will not go? 
Education, I said, and nurture:  If our citizens are well educated, and grow into sensible men, they will easily see their way through all these, as well as other matters which I omit; such, for example, as marriage, the possession of women and the procreation of children, which will all follow the general principle that friends have all things in common, as the proverb says. 
And without divine help, said Adeimantus, they will go on for ever making and mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining perfection. You would compare them, I said, to those invalids who, having no selfrestraint, will not leave off their habits of intemperance? 
Exactly. 
What, then, he said, is still remaining to us of the work of legislation? 
Nothing to us, I replied; but to Apollo, the God of Delphi, there remains the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of all. 
Well, then, I hope to make the discovery in this way:  I mean to begin with the assumption that our State, if rightly ordered, is perfect. 
Certainly not; that would only give a city the reputation of skill in carpentering. 
It is the knowledge of the guardians, he replied, and found among those whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians. And what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this sort of knowledge? 
The smiths, he replied, will be far more numerous. 
No one, he replied, would ever think of any other. Certainly not. 
I should like to hear what you are saying once more, for I do not think that I perfectly understand you. 
I do not know how that can be accomplished, he said, nor do I desire that justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of; and therefore I wish that you would do me the favour of considering temperance first. 
It may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons? 
Why, because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom, each of which resides in a part only, the one making the State wise and the other valiant; not so temperance, which extends to the whole, and runs through all the notes of the scale, and produces a harmony of the weaker and the stronger and the middle class, whether you suppose them to be stronger or weaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth, or anything else.  Most truly then may we deem temperance to be the agreement of the naturally superior and inferior, as to the right to rule of either, both in states and individuals. 
Would that I could! but you should regard me rather as a follower who has just eyes enough to, see what you show him—that is about as much as I am good for. 
Then the power of each individual in the State to do his own work appears to compete with the other political virtues, wisdom, temperance, courage. 
And the virtue which enters into this competition is justice? 
And the greatest degree of evildoing to one’s own city would be termed by you injustice? 
This then is injustice; and on the other hand when the trader, the auxiliary, and the guardian each do their own business, that is justice, and will make the city just. 
But here a confusion may arise; and I should wish to guard against an opponent starting up and saying that no man desires drink only, but good drink, or food only, but good food; for good is the universal object of desire, and thirst being a desire, will necessarily be thirst after good drink; and the same is true of every other desire. 
Would you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative terms, having clearly a relation— 
And might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink? 
I have heard the story myself, he said. 
But when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong, then he boils and chafes, and is on the side of what he believes to be justice; and because he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the more determined to persevere and conquer.  His noble spirit will not be quelled until he either slays or is slain; or until he hears the voice of the shepherd, that is, reason, bidding his dog bark no more. 
Certainly. 
And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business, whether in ruling or being ruled? 
Yes, certainly. And the division of labour which required the carpenter and the shoemaker and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business, and not another’s, was a shadow of justice, and for that reason it was of use? 
There were also, here and there on the banks of the river, monasteries, where the cenobites lived in separate cells, and only met together that they might the better enjoy their solitude. 
All lived in temperance and chastity; they wore a hair shirt and a hood, slept on the bare ground after long watching, prayed, sang psalms, and, in short, spent their days in works of penitence. 
Thus, they thought they fulfilled the words of the prophet, "The desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose." 
Strange tales were told in the cities, and even as far as Alexandria, how the earth had opened and swallowed up certain wicked persons whom one of these saints struck with his staff. 
When a hermit was about to die, a lion came and dug a grave with its claws. 
The devils, who so rudely assailed the good hermits, did not dare to approach him. 
He meant by that that he had eaten food properly dressed, and frequented the public baths. 
After his baptism he remained yet a year amongst the Gentiles, unable to cast off the bonds of old habits. 
During the ten years that he had lived remote from men, he no longer seethed in the cauldron of false delights, but more profitably macerated his flesh in the balms of penitence. 
If I care for this woman, it is only because she is Thy handiwork. 
Is she not, O Lord, the breath of Thy mouth? 
"May God be praised, brother Paphnutius," he said, as he leaned upon his spade. 
"God be praised!" replied Paphnutius. "And peace be unto my brother." 
Every morning He spreads His grace with the dew on my garden, and His goodness causes me to glorify Him in the cucumbers and melons which He gives me. 
Have you thought of any remedy for this great evil?" 
"Brother Palemon, do you disapprove of my project?" 
All things are dangerous for the hermit; it is sometimes a danger for him to read in the Scriptures that the Divine Master journeyed from town to town and supped with His disciples. 
Then the mysterious face of the sphinx expressed such profound sadness that Paphnutius was moved. 
He saluted him with the words the monks are accustomed to use when they meet each other. "Peace be with you, brother! May you some day taste the sweet joys of paradise." 
"Do you not desire to live through all eternity? 
But, tell me, do you not live in a hut in the desert as the hermits do?" 
You deny the truth which the idolaters themselves have sought. 
"Stranger, it is equally useless to abuse either dogs or philosophers. 
My father was a shipowner. 
In short, he was a man of no great parts. 
I grieve at your ignorance, Timocles, and I will instruct you in the truth, in order that knowing that there really exists a God in three hypostases, you may obey this God as a child obeys its father." 
Timocles interrupted him. "Refrain, stranger, from showing me your doctrines, and do not imagine that you will persuade me to share your opinions. 
Go thy ways, and strive not to withdraw me from the beneficent apathy in which I am plunged, as though in a delicious bath, after the hardships of my past days." 
He did not reply, lest the power given for edification should turn to destruction. For it sometimes happens, in disputing with infidels, that the means used for their conversion may steep them still farther in sin. 
Far as the eye could reach, the river rolled its broad green waters o'er which white sails, like the wings of birds, glided, and here and there on the shores, a white house shone out. 
I hate thee for thy riches, thy science, thy pleasures, and thy beauty. 
"It is vanity to glorify in metal these false sages; their lies are confounded, their souls are lost in hell, and even the famous Plato himself, who filled the earth with his eloquence, now disputes with the devils." 
The slave replied, more angrily than before"My master does not see dogs like you." 
They smiled, and had already brought the basin, the phials, and the metal mirror. 
Alas! they are but the dreams of sick men." 
As the two girls were pretty, they were not afraid of men, although they were slaves. 
They laughed at the strange appearance of the monk thus clad. 
"She is beautiful," replied Nicias, "and there was a time when she was dear to me. 
And Paphnutius gazed at him with horror, not conceiving it possible that a man should so calmly avow such a sin. 
He seemed to hear the sound of a clanging trumpet, and the sky became blood red, and he knew that the day of judgment had come. 
He also called to mind St. John the Egyptian, who for sixty years was tempted by the devil. But John saw through all the tricks of the demon. 
Would you like to accompany me?" It occurred to him at once that it would further his design to see Thais in the games, and Paphnutius followed the stranger. 
Now they no longer recite dramas, they act in dumb show; and of the divine spectacles with which Bacchus was honoured in Athens, we have kept nothing but what a barbariana Scythian evencould understandattitude and gesture. 
Hecuba had been warned by a prophetic dream, and lamented her daughter's fate and her own. 
Ulysses approached her, and asked her to give up Polyxena. 
Paphnutius saw again the woman he had come to seek. 
I must confess that women are sometimes beautiful. But they are liable to grievous afflictions, and disgusting inconveniences. 
The crowd felt grateful to her for showing them the forms and passions of life endowed with superhuman grace, and Paphnutius pardoned her present splendour on account of her coming humility, and glorified himself in advance for the saint he was about to give to heaven. 
Whilst the warriors enshrouded the victim with a veil, and covered her with lilies and anemones, terrified screams and groans rent the air, and Paphnutius, rising from his seat, prophesied in a loud voice. 
The actress then lived in the rich Racotis quarter, near the tomb of Alexander, in a house surrounded by shady gardens, in which a brook, bordered with poplars, flowed amidst artificial rocks. 
Yet his features always wore an air of joyous peace. 
As he performed his heavy tasks, he sang, in a harsh voice, hymns which made the child tremble and dream. 
The great Anthony, who saw his unshaken zeal, before he returned into the desert, pressed the black slave in his arms, and gave him the kiss of peace. 
And the good Lord God said to Prince Jesus"Leave My harem and My palace, and My date trees and My running waters. Descend to earth for the welfare of men. 
She wondered, and said"I should like to eat the pomegranates of the good Lord." 
Ahmes replied"Only those who are baptised may taste the fruits of heaven." 
Sometimes the breathing of an ass, or the soft lowing of an ox, accompanied, like a chorus of invisible spirits, the voice of the slave as he recited the gospels. 
His words flowed gently in the darkness, which they filled with zeal, mercy, and hope; and the neophyte, her hand in that of Ahmes, lulled by the monotonous sounds, and the vague visions in her mind, slept calm and smiling, amid the harmonies of the dark night and the holy mysteries, gazed down on by a star, which twinkled between the joists of the stableroof. 
His thin face ended in a long beard. 
Close by, an old negress unfolded a little white robe. 
Then, having dried that body which was destined, after many trials, to life immortal, the slave Nitida put on Thais the white robe she had woven. 
He said that the rich would not keep their wealth. 
The innkeeper hated him intensely, though he carefully concealed his rancour. 
Vivantius, accompanied by some of the Christian brethren, claimed the body, and buried it with the remains of the other martyrs in the crypt of St. John the Baptist, and the Church venerated the memory of Saint Theodore the Nubian. 
And she was afraid to be good, for her delicate flesh could not bear pain. 
The brutality of her master did not at all surprise her; it seemed natural to her to be badly treated. She even felt some respect for the old woman, who knew music and drank Greek wine. 
Thais danced and pleased. 
But one night that she had danced before the most fashionable young men of the city, the son of the proconsul came to her, radiant with youth and pleasure, and said, in a voice that seemed redolent of kisses"Why am I not, Thais, the wreath which crowns your hair, the tunic which enfolds your beautiful form, the sandal on your pretty foot? 
Come, sweet girl! come to my house, and let us forget the world." 
Lollius contrived to gain admittance, and came many times, but neither his pleadings nor his execrations had any effect on the obdurate girl. 
Thanks to her beauty, and to the lessons she had received from old Moeroe, she was received, and appeared on the stage in the part of Dirce. 
She replied angrily"I despise men like you, who hope for nothing and fear nothing. 
When she met any Christian priest, she thought of her baptism, and felt troubled. 
Priests, clad in white, were prostrate at the foot of the sarcophagus. 
It is true that, as long as we are what we are, we shall never find anything but our own thoughts in the thoughts of others, and that all of us are somewhat inclined to read books as I have read this one." 
"Come, let us cheat lifeit is sure to take its revenge. 
I hate you! 
When I was a child I knew a black slave who died on the cross. 
There were also tragic and comic masks, bright with colours; and paintings representing theatrical scenes or grotesque figures, or fabulous animals. 
It was a gift from Nicias. 
Flowering plants grew in large onyx vases. 
She smiled to herself, and murmured, "There is not a woman in Alexandria who can rival me in suppleness or grace or movement, or in splendour of arms, and the arms, my mirror, are the real chains of love!" 
I love thee, but not like those men who, burning with the lusts of the flesh, come to thee like devouring wolves or furious bulls. 
I promise thee better things than drunkenness crowned with flowers or the dreams of a brief night. 
The happiness that I bring thee will never end; it is unheardof, it is ineffable, and such that if the happy of this world could only see a shadow of it they would die of wonder." 
No, I am not ashamed, and all others who live like me are not ashamed either, although they are not so beautiful or so rich as I am. 
Look at me, look at these little feet; thousands of men would pay with their blood for the happiness of kissing them. 
She shook her head. "God? 
Let Him go away if we offend Him! 
Since He has created us, He can be neither angry nor surprised to see us as He made us, and acting according to the nature He has given us. 
The hand that drew Abraham from Chaldaea and Lot from Sodom has separated me from the present age. 
I know that the saints of the desert hate women who, like me, are made to please. 
As soon as I saw you, and without knowing who you were, I felt that you were no ordinary man. 
My lot in life is better than that of a queen, and yet I have many bitternesses and misfortunes, and I am infinitely weary of my existence. 
He is as good as He is powerful, and His name is the Saviour. 
Is not Thy face here, and that tear which flows down Thy cheek a real tear? 
Jesus, Thy loving lips open. 
I took her from the wife of the proconsul." 
When Thais appeared, acclamations arose from all sides. 
To her who gives suffering and its cure! 
Nicias embraced Paphnutius, and whispered in his ear"I warned you, brother, that Venus was powerful. 
It is her gentle force that has brought you here in spite of yourself. 
Yet my mother, who remembers seeing you then, says there were few women who were worthy to be compared with you." 
Dorion, having drunk, murmured"What is one's country? 
I will reply that the altars of the gods and the tombs of ancestors make one's country. 
"Did you say, Drosea, that the gods loved you?" asked Nicias, smiling. 
"Then they must share the same infirmities as men. 
Your teeth are so pretty!" 
"Eucrites," he said, "you are welcome. Have you composed a new treatise on philosophy this month? 
The philosophy of virtue is not dead. 
Zenothemis, turning towards the monk, said"Friends, a guest has come hither to join us. 
Therefore, we ought, my dear Lucius, to make him the more welcome, and strive to do that which would be most agreeable to him. Now it is certain that such a man cares less for the perfumes of meat than for the perfumes of fine thoughts. 
For my own part, I shall the more willingly discuss this doctrine, because it keenly interests me, on account of the number and the diversity of the allegories it contains. If one may guess at the spirit by the letter, it is filled with truths, and I consider that the Christian books abound in divine revelations. 
They were inspired not, as it was said, by the Spirit of God, but by an evil genius. 
On the contrary, the serpent with golden wings, which twined its azure coils round the tree of knowledge, was made up of light and love. 
Such an undertaking required extreme prudence, and the frailty of the first human couple rendered it almost hopeless. The wellintentioned demon essayed it, however. 
Adam meditated on these figures more than Eve did. 
That is why women, who, generally, are less reflective but more sensitive than men, rise more easily to the knowledge of things divine. 
Now, as she had listened attentively to the lessons of the serpent, Eve despised these empty terrors, and wished to taste the fruit which gave the knowledge of God. 
But we may even say more: the mind alone is capable of perfect rapture. For man is of a threefold nature, composed of material body, of a soul which is more subtle, but also material, and of an incorruptible mind. 
An autocrat, who governs by his single will, may sometimes cause most deplorable results; but if he governs by popular consent there is no remedy possible. 
Of all the mental satisfactions which intelligence, learning, and virtue can give, all that remains is the cruel pleasure of watching ourselves die. 
Our old Egypt, which was the cradle of the world, will be its burial vault; Serapis, the god of Death, will receive the last adoration of mortals, and I shall have been the last priest of the last god. 
A murmur of acclamation welcomed the arrival of the personage who had been called the Christian Plato. Hermodorus was the first to speak. 
Now, it is certain that a philosopher, like you, cannot think as the vulgar think, and we are curious to know your opinion of the principal mysteries of the religion you profess. 
At these words Paphnutius, white with horror and his face bedewed with the sweat of agony made the sign of the cross, but maintained a sublime silence. 
"You see these olives," he said. 
Let us talk more morally. 
Assuredly it would be well that the cripple should limp like Hephaistos: it would be well that the madman should indulge in all the fury of Ajax, that the incestuous woman should repeat the crimes of Phaedra, that the traitor should betray, that the rascal should lie, and the murderer kill, and when the piece was played, all the actorkings, just men, bloody tyrants, pious virgins, immodest wives, nobleminded citizens, and cowardly assassinsshould receive from the poet an equal share in the felicitations. 
For my part, friends, I believe in the reality of good and evil. 
This has been admirably expressed by the Christians, in the myth concerning the man with red hair, who, in order to betray his master, gave him the kiss of peace, and by such act assured the salvation of men. 
The poets surmised her divinity when they painted her so peaceful, superb, and fatal, and when they addressed that invocation to her, 'A soul as serene as a calm upon the waters.' 
Thus, passing from body to body, throughout all the evil ages, she takes upon her the sins of the world. 
Joined to us by the bonds of the flesh, loving us, and weeping with us, she will effect her redemption and ours, and will carry us, clinging to her white breast, into the peace of the regained paradise." 
Beware of offending the gods, impious Zenothemis; the poets are dear to them. 
Hymns have a pleasant sound to celestial ears. 
It is she! Lovely as in the time of Priam and the halcyon days of Asia, Eunoia is now called Thais. 
Was the Trojan horse big, Thais? 
The body may yield to lust without the soul being concerned. 
The lamps died out one by one. 
"What does that signify, Nicias? That it is foolish to attach importance to that which fades?" 
"How can a man be free, Eucrites, when he has a body?" 
At these words, drawing from the folds of his robe a naked dagger, he plunged it into his breast. 
They dragged the Divine Creator of all things down the gemonies() of the devils of hell, impudently denied the existence of Good and Evil, blasphemed Jesus, and exalted Judas. And the most infamous of all, the jackal of darkness, the stinking beast, the Arian full of corruption and death, opened his mouth like a yawning sepulchre. 
My Thais, thou hast seen these filthy snails crawling towards thee and defiling thee with their sticky sweat; thou hast seen others, like brutes, sleeping under the heels of their slaves; thou hast seen them coupling like beasts on the carpet they had fouled with their vomit; thou hast seen a foolish old man shed a blood yet viler than the wine which flowed at his debauch, and at the end of the orgie throw himself in the face of the unforeseen Christ. 
In front of them was a public square, deserted, and surrounded with steles and votive statues, and having at each end a semicircular marble seat, supported by figures of monsters. 
Thais fell on one of these seats. 
Albina, who, born in the purple, has donned the serge, and a daughter of the masters of this world, has risen to the rank of servant of Jesus Christ. 
One day I saw, with my own eyes, that statue turn its head like a living person, and then return to its ordinary attitude. 
The beautiful colours of some of them are truly wonderful, and they cost much money to those who gave them to me. 
Four Indians, who were employed in the kitchen, were the first to appear. 
Paphnutius sent away the women and the Greek menslaves, and said to the others"Bring wood to the middle of this place, make a huge fire, and throw into it pellmell all that there is in the house and grotto." 
But such a thought did not come from God, and I cast it from me, for assuredly it would be a great offence to the wellbeloved of Jesus Christ to offer them the spoils of thy lust. 
More wood! More links and torches! 
The young men, on their part, also thought"If Thais is going to renounce acting and love, our chief amusements will be taken from us. 
There were no kisses given in which she was altogether absent, for she was the joy of all voluptuaries, and the mere thought that she breathed amongst us excited us to pleasure." 
In every group the conduct of Thais was severely criticised. 
"She is robbing our children." 
Some thieves, too, also mingled with the crowd, and created a deafening clamour, and pushed their neighbours, to increase disorder, and take advantage of the tumult to filch some valuable object. 
But, being only used to subtle disquisitions with philosophers, he did not possess that imperious energy which commands vulgar minds. 
A shower of stones and shells fell on the monk, who, protecting Thais with his body, praised the Lord whose goodness turned his wounds into caresses. 
His friends encouraged the rivals, chose competitors, and made bets, and urged on the miserable wretches as they would have done fighting dogs. 
A cripple without legs having succeeded in seizing a drachma, the applause was frenetic. 
The young men themselves began to throw money, and nothing was to be seen in the square but a multitude of backs, rising and falling like waves of the sea, under a shower of coins. 
You will return to your cell, where, leaning like a tame camel, you will ruminate onI know not whatformulas of incarnations you have long chewed and rechewed, and in the evening you will swallow some radishes without any oil. 
They knew not what they did, and the grace of God, which I implored for them, may some day descend into their hearts. 
Their shops were full of clay figures painted in bright colours and representing gods and goddesses, mimes, women, winged sprites, &c., such as were usually buried with the dead. 
No, but I conclude therefrom that my death is, always has been, as it always will be. I do not feel it yet, but it is in me, and I ought not to fear it, for it would be folly to dread the coming of that which has arrived. It exists, like the last page of a book I read and have not finished." 
He followed, glaring at her in pious anger, as if she had been hell itself. 
O holy, holy, most holy Thais!" As he prayed and prophesied thus, a lad passed on an ass. 
Then, approaching the window, near which Thais stood peaceful and happy, he fell on his knees and praised the Lord three times. 
When Paphnutius strode across the sand, his disciples followed him, praising the Lord. 
He had hardly been an hour in prayer, when a vision of Thais passed before his eyes. 
Yet, to his great surprise, his heart was not at ease. He sighed. 
"Why art thou sad, O my soul, and why dost thou trouble me?" And his mind was still perturbed. 
The image of Thais never left him day or night. 
He did not try to banish it, because he still thought it came from God, and was the image of a saint. 
And as God, whose designs are inscrutable, did not see fit to enlighten his servant, Paphnutius, lost in doubt, resolved not to think of Thais any more. 
She gazed at him whilst he read, or meditated, or prayed, or met his eyes wherever he looked. 
It is the soul of things. 
His nights were one long dream, and his days did not differ from his nights. 
He no longer dared to pronounce the name of God near that horrible couch, and he feared that his cell being profaned, the demons might freely enter at any hour. 
"Admire his goodness; He sends me the animals that He has created that I may converse with them of His works, and praise Him in the birds of the air. Look at this pigeon; note the changing hues of its neck, and say, is it not a beautiful work of God? 
Such sudden transitions can but do harm to the health of the soul. 
In your place, brother Paphnutius, instead of retiring at once into some awful desert, I should take such amusements as are fitting to a monk and a holy abbot. 
I should not fail to study the regulations of the various communities which are scattered along the banks of the Nile, so as to be able to compare one with another. 
Such study is befitting a religious man like yourself. 
You have heard say, no doubt, that Abbot Ephrem has drawn up for his monastery pious regulations of great beauty. 
With his permission, you might make a copy of them, as you are a skilful penman. 
Little by little you would recover, in these pious works, peace of soul and mind; solitude would again become pleasant to your heart, and soon you would be in a condition to recommence those ascetic works which your journey has interrupted. 
He walked day and night until he reached the ruins of the temple, formerly built by the idolaters, in which he had slept amongst the scorpions and sirens on his former strange journey. 
He went to the neighbouring village, and ordered a ladder of that height to be made; and when the ladder was placed against the pillar, he ascended, knelt down on the top, and said to the Lord"Here, then, O God, is the abode Thou hast chosen for me. May I remain here, in Thy Grace, until the hour of my death." 
I have seen this in Alexandria; I have seen rich men carried away by the vice of lust, which, like a river with a turbid flood, swept them into the gulf of bitterness." 
The abbots Ephrem and Serapion, being informed of his strange proceeding, wished to behold him with their own eyes. 
The pilgrims were innumerable. 
And evilevil and deathspread over this immensity, cover them all, as night covers the earth. I am, in myself alone, a universe of evil thoughts." 
The seventh month, there came from Alexandria, Bubastis and Sais, women who had long been barren, hoping to obtain children by the intercession of the holy man and the virtues of his pillar. They rubbed their sterile bodies against the stone. 
Dropsical women, swollen like wine skins were placed on the ground before him. 
Monks and pilgrims, men and women, wallowed and struggled pellmell, their limbs twisted, foaming at the mouth, eating handfuls of earth and prophesying. 
Hundreds of crutches already hung round the wonderful column; grateful women suspended wreaths and votive images there. 
The hills gleamed with blue light, and Paphnutius thought he saw the body of Thais shinning in the glimmer of the waters amidst the sapphire night. 
And, for that reason, I praise Thee, O my God, for having made me the cesspool of the world." 
I may remind you that the gymnosophists of India can remain motionless, not merely for a year, but during twenty, thirty, or forty years." 
"This nephelococcygian practises medicine, like you. 
But the cause of this disease lies, partly, in the imagination, and you must confess, Lucius, that this monk, perched up on the head of a goddess, strikes the minds of the sick people more forcibly than I, bending over my mortars and phials in my laboratory, could ever do. 
Farewell, good Paphnutius! or rather, till our next meeting! If ever you should come down to earth again, and revisit Alexandria, do not fail to come and sup with me." 
And, the miracle being public and notorious, the deacons of the principal churches of Libya recorded it amongst the authentic facts. 
The voice continued"Arise, Paphnutius, and go seek in his palace the impious Constans, who, far from imitating the wisdom of his brother, Constantine, inclines to the errors of Arius and Marcus. 
Thou shalt reign over a peaceful and powerful Church. And, even as the soul directs the body, so shall the Church govern the empire. 
I can no longer distinguish between the clamours of hell and the voices of heaven. 
With that he seized the ladder which stood against the column, put his feet on it, and having descended a rung, found himself face to face with the monster's head; she smiled strangely. 
The doors were broken, and in the shadow of the chambers could be seen the gleaming eyes of hyaenas and wolves who brought forth their young there, whilst the dead bodies lay on the threshold, despoiled by robbers, and gnawed by the wild beasts. 
"Here," he sighed, "is the abode I have chosen; the tabernacle of my repentance and penitence." 
From morning to night he never lifted his forehead from the stone. 
It was certain that, wherever you went, you would find Thais again." He struck his forehead against the pavement, and uttered a cry of terror. 
He has certainly not as much sense as the old serpent, His adversary. 
You have misunderstood him. 
Paphnutius, if they are right, what a dupe you have been!" 
"With Heaven's help," he said to himself, "I shall subdue the flesh. 
A woman, whose mouth was close to the monk's ear, replied"Friend, I cannot rise; a man is lying on me." 
When he had thus prayed, wringing his hands, a terrible peal of laughter shook the walls of the tomb, and the voice which rang in his ears on the top of the column, said jeeringly"That is a prayer worthy of the breviary of Marcus, the heretic. 
"As we passed through the desert," said one of them, "we heard cries issuing from this tomb, and, having entered, we found you lying unconscious on the floor. 
Is it for my burial?" 
Those who watched by night, at the foot of the pillar, saw thy blessed assumption. 
The wings of the angels encircled thee in a white cloud, and with thy right hand extended thou didst bless the dwellings of man. 
But a foolish man, of the name of Paul, tried to contradict the general opinion. 
I have lived in a dream. 
Paphnutius resolved to go and receive the blessing of Anthony. 
Thou and I, being abbots, will march in front, and the others shall follow us, singing psalms." 
Woman is but a combination of all the temptations scattered in the thin air, on the flowering earth, in the clear waters. 
At Madaura, a city celebrated for its courtesans, I sought out all kinds of worldly love. 
On both sides of the horizon are long, black files that look like emigrant ants. 
Many of them were naked, but God had covered them with a fell of hair as thick as a sheep's fleece. 
Accompanied by Macarius and Amathas, Anthony passed along the ranks of the old hermits, anchorites, and cenobites. This seer, who had beheld heaven and hell; this hermit, who from a cave in the rock, governed the Christian Church; this saint, who had sustained the faith of the martyrs; this scholar, whose eloquence had paralysed the heretics, spoke tenderly to each of his sons, and bade them a kindly farewell, on the eve of the blessed death, which God, who loved him, had at last promised him. 
He said to the abbots Ephrem and Serapion"You command large armies, and you are both great generals. 
Therefore, you shall put on in heaven an armour of gold, and the Archangel Michael shall give you the title of kiliarchs of his hosts." 
My forehead, unceasingly in the dust, has become horny as a camel's knee. 
And we have prepared the bed of her glory, for we are her virtuesFaith, Fear, and Love." 
Twenty years had he contemplated a mummy's head, and yet the idea that death would close the eyes of Thais astonished him hopelessly. 
She opened to thee her armsflesh mingled with the perfume of flowersand thou wast not engulfed in the unspeakable enchantments of her unveiled breast. 
Not to have the joy to carry to hell the memory of that nevertobeforgotten hour, and to cry to God, 'Burn my flesh, dry up all the blood in my veins, break all my bones, thou canst not take from me the remembrance which sweetens and refreshes me for ever and ever!' ... 
Then, at the idea that she had given herself to others, and not to him; that she had poured forth an ocean of love, and he had not wetted his lips therein, he stood up, savagely wild, and howled with grief. 
Disappear, you lights, breezes, and perfumes! 
Oh, how easy it will be to me to die of her death! 
In this I showed prudence and foresight, for all day long Thais praised the Lord upon the flute, and the virgins, who were attracted by the sound of this invisible flute, said, 'We hear the nightingale of the heavenly groves, the dying swan of Jesus crucified.' 
I know, venerable father, that thy austere mind is alarmed at the idea of these performances. 
Dost thou remember the water of the spring, and the dates that we picked? ... 
Death was upon her, and the sweat of the last agony bedewed her forehead. 
She murmured"Heaven opens. I see the angels, the prophets, and the saints.... 
They draw near.... 
It passed as swiftly as it came, and left no trace beyond a certain trembling of the hand that now received the glass. 
"A glass," he said hoarsely, and then paused, and repeated it more clearly. 
"Why not a glass?" 
"I ask you," said Markheim, "for a Christmas present, and you give me thisthis damned reminder of years, and sins and folliesthis handconscience! 
To business. 
Markheim had feared to see it, and, lo! it was nothing. 
And yet, as he gazed, this bundle of old clothes and pool of blood began to find eloquent voices. 
He began to bestir himself, going to and fro with the candle, beleaguered by moving shadows, and startled to the soul by chance reflections. 
In many rich mirrors, some of home design, some from Venice or Amsterdam, he saw his face repeated and repeated, as it were an army of spies; his own eyes met and detected him; and the sound of his own steps, lightly as they fell, vexed the surrounding quiet. 
One visitor had come: at any moment another might follow and be more obstinate. 
The sense that he was not alone grew upon him to the verge of madness. 
And then again, and hearkening with every fresh attention, he blessed himself for that unresting sense which held the outposts and stood a trusty sentinel upon his life. 
With the tail of his eye he saw the dooreven glanced at it from time to time directly, like a besieged commander pleased to verify the good estate of his defences. 
A flash of ice, a flash of fire, a bursting gush of blood, went over him, and then he stood transfixed and thrilling. 
Fear held Markheim in a vice. What to expect he knew not, whether the dead man walking, or the official ministers of human justice, or some chance witness blindly stumbling in to consign him to the gallows. 
The visitor smiled. 
But, had I the time, I could disclose myself." 
But time flies; the servant delays, looking in the faces of the crowd and at the pictures on the hoardings, but still she keeps moving nearer; and remember, it is as if the gallows itself was striding towards you through the Christmas streets! 
"And do you, then, suppose me such a creature?" asked Markheim. 
Is this, then, your experience of mankind? or is it because you find me with red hands that you presume such baseness? and is this crime of murder indeed so impious as to dry up the very springs of good?" 
"This crime on which you find me is my last. 
"Ah," said Markheim, "but this time I have a sure thing." 
The sweat started upon Markheim's brow. 
I do not love the one thing, I love all. 
Not so; good, also, is a spring of acts." 
But the visitant raised his finger. 
"That being so," he said, "shall I show you the money?" 
Once the girl within, and the door closed, the same dexterity that has already rid you of the dealer will relieve you of this last danger in your path. 
His past went soberly before him; he beheld it as it was, ugly and strenuous like a dream, random as chancemedleya scene of defeat. 
Then Belgarath, a sorcerer and disciple of the God Aldur, led forth the king of the Alorns and his three sons, and they reclaimed the Orb from the iron tower of Torak. 
This gave the West time to mobilize and prepare. 
The battle hath claimed their lives and those of a multitude of thy Grolim priests as well." 
Then came a voice from the midst of the Rivans, saying, "In the name of Belar I defy thee, Torak. 
A great cry went up from the host of the Angaraks when they saw what had befallen Kal Torak, and they sought to flee in their panic. 
Brand asked that the body of the Accursed One be brought to him, that he might behold him who would be king of all the world. 
But the body was not to be found. In the night, Zedar the Sorcerer had cast an enchantment and passed unseen through the armies of the West, bearing away the one he had chosen as master. 
And Belgarath said to him, "Torak is not dead. 
Again the woman spoke. "In the fullness of time the Rivan King will rise to claim his own, as the ancient Prophecy foretells. 
Then the woman who was Polgara replied. "The Rivan King will return to assume his throne and claim his bride. 
Tell him also that in the day Tolnedra fails in this, the West shall rise against him and scatter the sons of Nedra to the winds and pull down the might of the Empire, until Imperial Tolnedra is no more." 
They took ship at Camaar in Sendaria and set sail for Riva. 
The core of his life, the rock upon which his childhood had been built, had always been Aunt Pol. 
Garion had never wanted to believe in sorcery or magic or witchcraft. 
Such things were unnatural, and they violated his notion of solid, sensible reality. 
It's like a graveyard." 
"These things happen from time to time. 
At the end of the room opposite the narrow doorway a wide crack between two of the roughhewn blocks provided a natural chimney. 
Durnik had soberly considered the crack the previous evening when they had arrived, cold and wet, and then had quickly constructed a crude but efficient fireplace out of rubble. 
Durnik in his brown leather tunic was stacking firewood along the wall. 
Not a chance." 
Since there was absolutely nothing he could do about his circumstances, chewing on them would only leave a sour taste in his mouth. 
How's your wife?" Detton asked politely. 
After that my wife stopped eating. It didn't take her long to die." I'm sorry," Detton sympathized. 
Garion glared at this emptyheaded young nobleman, quite certain that the singing fool had never made a meal of tree roots or mourned the passing of a wife who had starved herself to death out of grief. 
Garion was not normally a belligerent boy, and under other circumstances he might have approached the situation differently. 
The second part of Garion's plan, however, fell completely apart. 
It was Mister Wolf. The old man was striding toward them with Barak and Silk close on his heels. 
Let it standSilk's fingers flickered at him in the minute gestures of the Drasnian secret language. 
I thought that if I dressed like one of their toadies I wouldn't be bothered." 
"What are they doing with the swords, father?" she demanded, her eyes flashing. 
"A very colorful young man." 
My father had the limbs of this bow cut on the day I was born, and I could draw it by the time I was eight." 
Garion laughed a bit ruefully, remembering his bruised ribs and aching head. 
You take your spear and wait where the boars are likely to pass when they try to get away from the noise. 
Garion was shocked at that. 
thought that the Arendish civil war was over." 
There are many who don't believe that. 
I know you're my friend, and I know you won't betray what I said in a moment of heat." 
"It's an orderly kind of place." 
What sort of work does your father do?" Lelldorin asked politely. He's dead. 
I was a baby." Garion shrugged, trying to sound offhand about it. 
He gripped Garion's hand firmly. 
"We'll show you where the others are." 
"They stay in their lairs in the wintertime. 
Wouldn't that mean that your original name was Garath?" Silk asked, his ferret eyes narrowing shrewdly. 
"Torak isn't dead; only asleep. 
I don't understand," Barak said, frowning. 
Not only that, it makes" He frowned. "Let's call it a sort of noise. 
She sat beside the fire, carefully mending a small tear in one of Garion's tunics. 
I'm sure you can see why." Oh, of course," Silk professed, though his tone indicated that he did not. 
That can't happen, of course," Wolf told them. 
Most of the things we'll encounter can be dealt with by ordinary means," Wolf continued. 
The small man looked out into the fog. "Let's act as if we believed that it is," he suggested. 
Are you afraid too, Silk?" Garion asked. Silk sighed. "Yes," he admitted, "but we can behave as if we believed that we aren't, can't we?" 
Please," Silk objected in an injured tone. "The name's very important. 
I don't see any difference," Barak asserted bluntly. 
Besides, Radek's always accompanied by servants." 
All right." Don't you want to hear them?" 
"This place is a ruin anyway." 
Once they were under the trees, Lelldorin pulled his horse in beside Garion's, and they rode together. 
"From what I understand, the Drasnians have been at this sort of thing for centuries." 
Garion had thought that Lelldorin had forgotten his impulsive pledge. 
The prospect of a serious search for his parents' murderer with this young enthusiast adding embellishments and improvisations at every turn began to present itself alarmingly. By midmorning, after they had picked up Silk's packs and lashed them to the backs of the spare horses, they were back out on the Great West Road, the Tolnedran highway running through the heart of the forest. 
"The poorest people always suffer the most. 
All right, I will. 
Don't let your exuberant young companion drag you into something that's none of your business." 
Silk's look was direct, and Garion realized that the little man was quite serious. 
Are you making fun of me?" 
The gray stone house of Count Reldegen was about a mile back in the forest from the highway, and it stood in the center of a clearing that extended beyond bowshot in every direction. 
Garion stared at the brooding pile as they approached in the rapidly fading light. 
There was a kind of haughty ugliness about the house, a grim solidity that seemed to defy the world. 
A quaint custom of the region," Silk informed him. 
Great curving stone arches supported the ceiling. 
Books, Reldegen?" Mister Wolf said in amazement as he and the others removed their cloaks and gave them to the servants who immediately appeared. 
Prince Kheldar of the royal house of Drasnia," Mister Wolf introduced Silk. 
My Lord," she stated gravely, "I've been bathing winter or summer for more years than you could possibly imagine." 
Why should he want to?" Lelldorin asked. He's desperate for some kind of holding he can call his own," Torasin replied. 
No," Lelldorin replied firmly, taking hold of Garion's arm. 
I don't want to know what you're planning." 
"It won't be just a simple ambush, Garion. 
Something happens to a country when you kill its king," Garion explained. 
"You ate the biggest part of one deer by yourself." 
The merchant said that he knew somebody we might be interested in meeting and he introduced us to Nachak. 
Probably not." 
How could we? 
Didn't that seem a little odd?" 
Then he gives you a plan to kill the king and start a war with Tolnedra; and to make sure you succeed with his plan, he gives you money. 
It's such a good plan," he burst out finally. 
They reached the Great West Road then, and Barak led them south at a brisk trot, cutting off the possibility of further discussion. 
Two ragged serfs were dispiritedly hacking chunks of firewood from one of the stumps near the road. 
"Does it make you feel good to know that your own countrymen are so afraid of you that they run from the very sight of you?" 
They're serfs, Garion," he said as if that explained. 
They're not animals. Men deserve to be treated better." 
And with that Lelldorin's attention turned inward again as he continued to struggle with the dilemma Garion had placed upon him. 
By late afternoon they had covered ten leagues and the cloudy sky was gradually darkening as evening approached. 
There's a woodcutter's track right there." Durnik pointed at a break in the trees just ahead. 
Twelve leagues," Hettar estimated. 
Something wrong?" Barak asked, also rising. 
With a great sweep, Barak's heavy sword shattered an upflung blade and crunched down into the angle between the neck and shoulder of the blackwhiskered man who had held it. 
He struggled for an instant, then felt a stunning blow on the back of his head, and his eyes filled with a blinding flash of light. 
He was being carriedthat much was certain. 
His vision was blurred and uncertain, but he could make out Barak's bearded face looming above him in the darkness, and merged with it, as once before in the snowy woods outside Val Alorn, he seemed to see the shaggy face of a great bear. 
Barak coughed and wiped at his face. 
Those that could still run," Silk answered, his voice a bit excited and his ferret eyes bright. 
I heard it growling while I was looking for youawful growls." 
Nothing." 
They're still running," Hettar announced. 
The steel discs on his horsehide jacket gleamed red in the flickering light, and his sabre was streaked with blood. 
They seemed to be awfully good at that part of it," Wolf said. 
His voice shook a little, and his face was very pale. 
Lelldorin was retrieving his arrows, carefully pulling them out of the bodies. Let's drag them all over there a ways," Barak said to Hettar. 
Durnik looked away, and Garion saw two great tears standing in his eyes. 
I've never killed anyone before," Durnik said, the tears now running down his face. 
Yes, it has, father." 
She raised her arms and pushed her fingers through the long, dark weight of her hair. 
Then they're just ordinary thieves?" 
She flexed her fingers in an unpleasantly suggestive manner. 
It's not worth the time it would take," Wolf told her, scratching thoughtfully at his beard. 
After tomorrow he won't buy much of anything," Wolf replied with a short laugh. 
You should have done that from the beginning, father. 
Sometimes you're too delicate about things." 
Don't be cross, father. 
Forty at least," Hettar answered firmly. There," Durnik said, his head cocked to one side. 
"Hear that?" 
"Thou madest mention of robbers," he said. 
They set upon us after we had made our night's encampment. 
How may we expect duty and proper submission from serfs when nobles raise detestable rebellion against the crown?" the knight asserted. 
He looked inquiringly at Silk. 
I think you should proceed, good merchant," the Tolnedran told Silk. 
Though he had not had the chance to become directly involved in the fight in the clearing the night before, he felt somehow as if he were spattered with blood or worse. 
He removed his clothing in the chilly bathhouse and even, without thinking, the silver amulet Mister Wolf and Aunt Pol had given him, and then he entered the steaming tub where he scrubbed at his skin with a coarse brush and strong soap, much harder than even the most meticulous obsession with personal cleanliness would have required. 
The inn smelled of stale beer and halfrotten food. 
Might I suggest that your next crusade include a visit to the Lord of this demesne? 
I hadn't realized it was so bad," Lelldorin replied in a subdued voice. 
He looked around as if seeing certain things for the first time. 
Please, my Lord," a little girl with huge eyes begged, "have you a crust of bread to spare?" 
Garion looked at her helplessly. 
He looked at the figure at the edge of the woods for a long time, noticing without even being aware of it that though the horse and rider stood in the full light of the setting sun, there was no shadow behind them. 
"What's troubling you, Lelldorin?" he asked finally. 
What good will that do? 
You're going to keep making these mistakes as long as you keep carrying your brain in the same scabbard with your sword, Lelldorin." 
It's not that you're stupid, Lelldorin," Garion protested. 
Arends aren't stupidthey're just impulsive." 
This is the last stretch of forest before we come out on the plains of central Arendia," Lelldorin explained. 
It would take a thousand men a thousand years to gather all the bones that lie here and commit them to earth," Lelldorin intoned morbidly. 
"Whole generations of Arendia rest hereMimbrate, Wacite, Asturian. 
Garion shuddered and pulled his eyes away from the mute appeal of that lone arm rising from the sea of moss on the floor of the forest. 
As you said before, sometimes we Arends aren't very bright." 
They're calling to each other," Wolf told him. 
But suddenly a halfdozen snarling Algroths were in the road in front of them, their arms spread wide and their mouths gaping hideously. 
They were huge, with apelike arms and claws instead of fingers. 
Their faces were goatish, surmounted by short, sharppointed horns, and they had long, yellow fangs. 
I have to get the poison out immediately," she told them. 
Garion drew his dagger and handed it to her. 
She pulled ofl' her blue cloak and covered Lelldorin with it. Silk, Barak and Hettar stood at the edge of the slope, heaving large rocks over the edge. 
It's too early to tell," she answered. 
"Up here!" 
"Thy friends below were most frolicsome." 
The practical one is Goodman Durnik of Sendaria, and this boy is Garion, my grandsonseveral times removed." 
I wanted to see for myself how you'd managed to translate the Prophecy into everyday terms." 
Wolf smiled coldly, but did not answer. 
Grolim courtesy always leaves me quite cold," she returned with a frosty look. 
"It was all just an illusion. 
He can't ride," she told him firmly. 
Durnik nodded and went to the packs for rope to use in building the litter. 
During the worst of Lelldorin's paroxysms, Garion helplessly held the young man's hand, unable to think of anything else to do to ease his pain. Bear thine infirmity with fortitude, good youth," Mandorallen cheerfully advised the injured Asturian after a particularly bad bout that left Lelldorin gasping and moaning. 
He moved his warhorse ahead at a canter until he was some distance in front of the rest of them. 
"Thee's and thou's and cloth's?" 
It mentions companionsthe bear, the rat, and the man who will live twice. 
It isn't necessary," Lelldorin advised weakly from his litter. 
If, however, you are all such cowardly dogs that you have no stomach for such a contest, cease this brawling and stand aside so that your betters may pass." Splendidly spoken, my Lord Barak," Mandorallen said with admiration. 
Of Sir Mandorallen the bastard we have all heard," a swarthy knight in black enamelled armor sneered, "but who is this redbearded ape who so maligns his betters?" 
Gently, my Lord," Mandorallen advised. He glanced down with a certain satisfaction at the unconscious form of his senseless kinsman twitching in the tall grass. 
Very well," Mandorallen replied. 
"Would any here gainsay my words?" 
Nay, my Lady," Mandorallen protested. Wolf barked sharply. "Move, Mandorallen!" Mandorallen looked startled and stepped aside. 
"He could have killed you." 
I will protect you, Mistress Pol," Durnik replied stubbornly. 
Without warning she suddenly embraced the startled Durnik. "You great, clumsy, dear fool," she said. 
"Never do that againnever! 
What have we done?" the baron groaned, his face anguished. 
Chain the Murgo," the baron ordered the assembled knights. 
"I'll be able to ride in a day or so." 
Thy wound, however, will soon begin to abscess and then suppurate, and raging fever and delirium will aflict thee, making thy presence a burden upon us. 
"I wish I could go on with you." 
"We don't have much time, my friend," he gasped weakly, "so listen carefully." 
I'll stop him, Lelldorin," Garion vowed. 
"I don't know how yet, but one way or another, I'll stop him." 
Garion stared at him with a dreadful fear until he saw the faint flutter of his pulse in the hollow of his throat. 
"You aren't going to like it, but I don't really care." Oh?" the knight replied mildly. 
I think the way you talked to Lelldorin back there was cruel and disgusting," Garion told him. 
"They killed my parents," he replied. 
The Murgos were on us before my father and I could get her back on her horse. 
Mandorallen smiled wanly. 
"Most of the time I prefer not to interfere with other people's amusements, but I can't afford to have Arendia going up in flames just now. 
"Do we want to stop, or should we go around it. 
They're not really in bad shape yet," Hettar informed him, "but they're starting to feel sorry for themselves. 
One does one's best," Silk replied mockingly. 
"The Fair's always here, but the population's very fluid. 
Radek, old friend," a bald Drasnian merchant called from a nearby tent. 
Have you seen any Murgos here at the Fair? 
When he could not sell, he bought; when he could not buy, he traded; and when he could not trade, he dredged for gossip and information. 
He was willing to deal with anyone. He met them all on their own ground. 
If I ask too much, nobody'll talk to me; and if I ask too little, I'll be laughed out of the Fair." 
I don't see that it's all that funny, Garion," Silk said sensitively. He remained moody and irritable as they entered the pavilion. 
"Here's the profit I promised you," he told Mister Wolf somewhat ungraciously as he poured coins into the old man's hand. What's bothering you?" 
Wolf asked, eyeing the little man's grumpy face. 
Nothing," Silk replied shortly. 
We don't want to let him get away." Durnik looked baffled, but he lifted the tent flap and stepped out. 
We won't," Wolf replied. 
After a moment he saw the unkempt Brill half hidden between two tents across the street. 
But will this curious Sendar not follow us as soon as we leave the tent?" Mandorallen asked. 
The back wall of the tent is only canvas, Mandorallen," Silk pointed out gently. 
"You go one way, and we'll go another. 
Why not just have Hettar slip out the back, circle around behind him, and stick a knife between his ribs? 
"I want him to tell the Murgos that we're in this tent. 
With any luck, they'll sit outside for a day or so before they realize that we're gone." 
Finally he drew a deep breath and went out again, one arm tucked up as if he were carrying something. 
Delvor returned soon after that, and they all waited in the warm tent as it grew darker outside and the streets emptied. 
Money's awfully important to Tolnedrans," Barak observed. 
Garion trembled. 
Aunt Pol," he gasped, the nightmare suddenly dropping away. 
She put her arms about him tightly and held him for some time. 
"Hold it in your right hand, dear," she instructed, firmly closing Garion's fingers over the pendant. 
Who was the old man?" Garion asked. 
Garion felt particularly exhausted, and he wished that he were young enough to sit close beside Aunt Pol and perhaps to put his head in her lap and sleep as he had done when he was very young. 
Mister Wolf glanced over at Aunt Pol. 
The speck began to circle, rising higher and higher until it disappeared. 
It's hard to say." 
He didn't really want to like Mandorallen; but aside from the habitual gloominess which seemed characteristic of all Arends and the studied and involuted archaism of the man's speech and his towering self confidence, there seemed little actually to dislike. A half league along the road from the castle, a ruin sat at the top of a long rise. It was not much more than a single wall with a high archway in the center and broken columns on either side. 
Near the ruin a woman sat on horseback, her dark red cape flowing in the wind. 
We should have taken a different route," Wolf said. 
His tone was critical, even offended. 
"Things never went any further. 
But, since they both loved and respected the baron too much to dishonor him, Mandorallen left the castle before things could get out of hand. 
You didn't have to say that, Pol." Silk laughed sardonically. 
His nobility was beginning to get rather cloying." 
Does the baron know about it?" Durnik asked. 
"There's no shame in it as long as it doesn't go any further." 
They were five days on the road before they reached the River Arend, the boundary between Arendia and Tolnedra. 
The weather improved as they moved farther south, and by the morning when they reached the hill overlooking the river, it was almost warm. 
Appearances are very important in Vo Mimbre, and we don't want to arrive looking like vagabonds." 
Wolf nodded. 
"This ought to do," he decided, dismounting in a grassy glade. 
"All right," he told them, "we're going to Vo Mimbre. 
You tend to belabor things too much." 
"You should have folded it more carefully. 
I'm not going to wear that thing," he declared flatly. 
Why not just save yourself all the time and aggravation?" 
THE CITY OF THE MIMBRATE ARENDS reared almost like a mountain beside the sparkling river. 
Upon that rock the tide of Angarak crashed and recoiled and crashed again. 
We must needs take council with him in matters of gravest urgency." 
They clattered through the archway and into the narrow, crooked streets. 
Surely thou canst see my crest upon the face of my shield." 
Dost thou question my word, Sir Knight?" Mandorallen returned in an ominously quiet voice. "And wilt thou then come down and put thy doubt to the test? 
I don't think we're getting anywhere with this," Mister Wolf muttered. 
Then he strode to the center of the plaza and stood there in his gleaming white robe. "Sir Knight," he called up mildly to Andorig, "you're a cautious man, I see. 
He bent then and inserted the twig he'd been holding between two of the broad granite flagstones at his feet. 
It hath grown here to renew thy faith and trust. Thy debt to it must be paid with tender and loving attention to its needs. 
The palace gate creaked open, and they all rode into the inner courtyard and dismounted. 
The Arendish throne room was a great, vaulted hall with sculptured buttresses soaring upward along the walls. 
"All the world knows of thy power, but men have forgotten to speak of thy beauty." 
My heart trembles at the sight of the flower of all womanhood," the queen declared. 
"As the revered Belgarath hath intimated, our mission is the hingepin of the survival of all the kingdoms of the west. 
I thank great Chaldan that I still have my vigor, and that my prowess is undiminished by the passage of a mere fourscore years." 
The players, however, seemed content to leave it up to him to come up with a way to do it. 
Summon musicians and command that a banquet be made ready." 
I am chagrined to find that thou bast given ear to slanders without offering me opportunity to reply. 
The Murgo's name had struck Garion almost like a blow. 
No lies, Nachak," Wolf told him. 
He was still holding Hettar's arm. 
"Thou wilt present demands to me in my own court?" 
"Grandfather," he repeated, "there's something I have to tell you." 
"All right, Garion," he said in a strangely quiet voice. 
Nachak stepped back and made a quick gesture to his steelclad knights. 
They're sure that the rest of Asturia will follow them at that point." 
I can't say, your Majesty," Garion replied painfully. 
Helplessly, Garion shook his head. 
The boy must be forced to identify these imaginary plotters or to admit that he lies." 
"Kill him!" he snarled at the six men in armor surrounding him. The knights looked shocked, doubtful. Kill him!" Nachak commanded them. 
What treason is this?" Mandorallen demanded of them. 
Noting that Mandorallen had not carried his shield into the throne room, the redbearded man jerked an enormous twohanded broadsword down from the array of banners and weapons at one side of the dais. "Mandorallen!" he shouted and with a great heave he slid the huge blade skittering and bouncing across the stone floor toward the knight's feet. 
Mandorallen stopped the sliding weapon with one mailed foot, stooped, and picked it up. 
The approaching knights looked a bit less confident as Mandorallen lifted the sixfoot blade with both hands. 
Barak parried a sword stroke from a burly knight with his axe and battered at the man's raised shield with his own heavy sword. 
The stricken knight stiffened as the sabre ran into his brain. 
Perhaps so," the king acknowledged. 
He frowned thoughtfully, then shook his head as if to put certain dark speculations aside. 
"My throne room hath become as a battlefield. 
I am in thy debt, Lord Barak," Mandorallen said gravely. 
You did a nice job on Nachak," Barak complimented him. 
No matter how justifiedhow necessaryhis speaking out had been, he still suffered the pangs of guilt. 
Her bodice was cut quite low, and Garion found some difficulty in finding a safe place for his eyes as she bore down on him. 
"I didn't do all that much, my lady," he replied with a somewhat insincere attempt at modesty. 
He blushed and floundered helplessly. 
Art thou in truth, noble Garion, the grandson of Eternal Belgarath?" 
The exquisite involvement of Arendish ethics were beyond his grasp. 
Mandorallen laughed easily. "Of course," he answered, "though I must confess to thee in all honesty, Garion, that my eagerness to stand as thy champion grew not entirely out of friendship. 
Husband?" Garion responded in a faltering voice. Thou art fair game, lad. 
"Now perchance we may continue our most interesting discussion, Lord Garion," she purred at him. 
Mandorallen spoke briefly to her, and she immediately crossed to the spot where the violeteyed countess held Garion captive. 
A most forgetful boy," she told the countess. 
"I perceive that thou hast routed our predatory countess, my Lady. 
Don't Arends have anything better to do than gossip about things that don't concern them? 
The matter is of great concern to us all, my Lady," Mandorallen apologized. 
She gave him a withering look. "Garion, dear," she told him bluntly, "don't ever make the mistake of thinking that I'm stupid." I didn't," he floundered. 
Then she laughed fondly and put her arm about his shoulder and everything was all right again. 
About midmorning Sir Andorig, the darkhaired knight Mister Wolf had ordered to spend his days caring for the tree in the plaza, came looking for Mandorallen. 
He broke the seal without discontinuing the conversation, which turned upon riches. "The man," he said, "who does not possess at least a million is a poor wretch." 
I acknowledged his politeness with a bow, which, however, he did not perceive, having turned round to speak with some one else. 
Did I not assure thee that my own eyes had seen all this, thou wouldst certainly disbelieve it. 
O my dear Chamisso! even to thee I blush to mention what follows. 
Then I dreamed of thee, and fancied I stood behind the glass door of thy little room, and saw thee seated at thy table between a skeleton and a bunch of dried plants; before thee lay open the works of Haller, Humboldt, and Linnaeus; on thy sofa a volume of Goethe, and the Enchanted Ring. 
I stood a long time contemplating thee, and everything in thy apartment; and again turning my gaze upon thee, I perceived that thou wast motionlessthou didst not breathethou wast dead. 
Neither of my windows opened on the sea. 
I dared not take a single step beyond my own door; and in the evening I had forty wax tapers lighted before I ventured to leave the shade. 
A fair and beauteous maiden, apparently accompanied by her parents, who gravely kept looking straight before them, chanced to cast a beaming glance on me; but was evidently startled at perceiving that I was without a shadow, and hiding her lovely face in her veil, and holding down her head, passed silently on. 
Perhaps I may succeed in finding him; and how fortunate it were if he should be as ill satisfied with his bargain as I am with mine! I desired Bendel to be sent for, who seemed to possess some tact and ability. 
"The false shadow that I might paint," said the artist, "would be liable to be lost on the slightest movement, particularly in a person who, from your account, cares so little about his shadow. 
"No shadow!" exclaimed the faithful young man, tears starting from his eyes. 
When I spoke, I was listened to; and I was at a loss to know how I had so easily acquired the art of commanding attention, and giving the tone to the conversation. 
Before the carriage now appeared in white dresses a chorus of maidens, all of extraordinary beauty; but one of them shone in resplendent loveliness, and eclipsed the rest as the sun eclipses the stars of night. 
Bendel at last thought of an expedient; he jumped out of the carriage. I called him back, and gave him out of the casket I had by me a rich diamond coronet, which had been intended for the lovely Fanny. He stepped forward, and spoke in the name of his master, who, he said, was overwhelmed by so many demonstrations of respect, which he really could not accept as an honourthere must be some error; nevertheless he begged to express his thanks for the goodwill of the worthy townspeople. 
It was really astonishing how magnificently and beautifully everything was arranged in these few hours. 
Evening drew on, the guests arrived, and were presented to me. 
She modestly accompanied her parents, and seemed unconscious of her transcendent beauty. 
At length I hesitatingly entreated her to honour my banquet by presiding at itan office for which her rare endowments pointed her out as admirably fitted. 
In her person majesty, innocence, and grace, in union with beauty, presided over this joyous banquet. Minna's happy parents were elated by the honours conferred upon their child. 
He enjoyed the general good opinion; for he projected a shadow of respectable size, though of somewhat faint hue. This man wished to show off in this place by means of his wealth, and sought to rival me. 
I had made it a point to observe the strictest precaution; and, with the exception of Bendel, no one was permitted, on any pretence whatever, to enter my private apartment. 
The numerous couriers, whom I kept in constant attendance about matters of no importance, were supposed to be the bearers of my despatches. 
Oh, my Chamisso! 
She laid her head on my shoulder, still silent and in tears. 
I had carefully filled a large chest with gold, and sat down to await the appointed timethe twelfth hourit struck. 
The faithful Bendel reminded him that if such words reached his master's ears, he would turn him out of an excellent place. 
I stood as if struck by a thunderbolt, and for some time was unable to speak. 
At last, I asked him how a servant could dare to behave so towards his master. 
Perhaps, another time, I may be more fortunate. Farewell! May we shortly meet again! 
I was evidently gaining on the shadowI came nearer and nearerI was within reach of it, when it suddenly stopped and turned towards me. Like a lion darting on its prey, I made a powerful spring and fell unexpectedly upon a hard substance. 
You have now no Bendel; but I will act for him. I regret that you are not overfond of me; but that need not prevent you from accepting my poor services. The devil is not so black as he is painted. Yesterday you provoked me, I own; but now that is all forgotten, and you must confess I have this day succeeded in beguiling the wearisomeness of your journey. 
I examined my pockets, and found I had a few gold pieces still left, which I counted with feelings of great satisfaction. 
I could not imagine what had happened to me. 
They were addressing me in the language and with the salutations of their country. I rose, and drew back a couple of steps. 
Do you not also feel an inward satisfaction in thus paying a pious tribute of gratitude and love to your old master and friend?" "Thanks be to God, I do, noble lady," said he. "Ah, how wonderfully has everything fallen out! How thoughtlessly have we sipped joys and sorrows from the full cup now drained to the last drop; and we might fancy the past a mere prelude to the real scene for which we now wait armed by experience. 
There I found everything exactly in the order in which I had left it; and returned by degrees, as my increasing strength allowed me, to my old occupations and usual mode of life, from which I was kept back a whole year by my fall into the Polar Ocean. 
The story sprang into being of itself, like every work of genius, prompted by a selfcreating power. In a letter to the writer of this notice, after he had just commenced the story, he says, "A book was the last thing you would have expected from me! 
Such stories did the Dragonfly tell; and as the Child sat motionless with his eyes shut, and his head rested on his little hand, she thought he had fallen asleep; so she poised her double wings and flew into the rustling wood. 
But, behold, the Tulip turned up her nose, and the Ranunculus held her head as stiffly as possible, that she might not bow goodmorrow to him. 
But he found everything far more beautiful and lovely even than she had described it; for all about, wherever he went, the tender moss pressed his little feet, and the delicate grass embraced his knees, and the flowers kissed his hands, and even the branches stroked his cheeks with a kind and refreshing touch, and the high trees threw their fragrant shade around him. 
And soon did the royal sun himself arise; at first his dazzling diadem alone appeared above the mountains; at length he stood upon their summit in the full majesty of his beauty, in all the charms of eternal youth, bright and glorious, his kindly glance embracing every creature of earth, from the stately oak to the blade of grass bending under the foot of the wayfaring man. 
The dragonfly flew on before and showed him the way as far as the outermost verge of the wood, whence the Child could espy his own little hut, and then flew away to her playfellows. 
Now I awaken, for I am thine and mine: the Night hast thou given as a sign of life, and made me man. 
Devour with glowing spiritual fire this earthly body, that I ethereal may abide with thee in union yet more perfect, and then may the bridal Night endure for ever.

Then Riva was ashamed. He set blade and hilt together, and the blade passed into the hilt as a stick slides into water. 
Then it ran away, but stopped to look back. Riva saw that it was a fox no longer, but the great silver wolf form of Belgarath. 
And with each joining, the brilliance of the Orb increased. 
Thus it was in the city of Riva for a thousand years. 
The sons of Nedra importuned their king, whom they called Emperor, to force the city gates so that they might hawk their wares in the streets, and the Emperor sent his army to the Isle. 
The traitorous assassins were overcome, and Brand questioned each in turn in ways that made brave men tremble. 
But the end thereof lay entangled within the Prophecy. And even to the Prophecy was the ultimate conclusion unknown. 
It was the song of the Orb that obliterated all thoughtmore than shock or the thunderous detonation that had destroyed Ctuchik and tumbled Belgarath across the floor like a rag doll or the deep sullen boom of the earthquake that had followed. 
Run!" Relg repeated. 
The red glow of the newrisen sun was blinding as the dark world of the caves was violently opened, and the great wound in the side of the peak revealed a dozen or more dark openings both above and beneath, where caves suddenly ran out into nothingness. 
The little boy pulled his hand free from Garion's and went confidently to the big Cherek. "Errand?" he asked, holding out the round, gray stone in his hand. 
"Make him stop waving it around like that, Polgara. 
"He's exhausted, though. 
Is it over?" Durnik asked, looking around nervously. 
Barak was peering curiously at the little boy. "Where did he come from?" he asked, his rumbling voice also subdued. 
Let's go, Mandorallen," the big Cherek muttered, grimly drawing his sword. The knight nodded, shifting his own broadsword in his hands. 
"We shouldn't be long." 
And then he and Mandorallen moved off into the darkness, their black Murgo robes blending into the shadows. 
Sharply, he heard the awful, hissing crackle of Asharak burning beneath the vast, ancient trees in the Wood of the Dryads and heard the Grolim's desperate plea, "Master, have mercy." 
This is its way of finding things out." 
One way or another, it's going to get what it wants. " 
A few moments later they heard the scuff of footsteps, and Barak and Mandorallen returned. 
Relg's face went hard, but he said nothing. 
It had a peculiar kind of curiosity, lingering often on things Garion did not think were all that important and barely touching matters that had seemed so dreadfully urgent when they had occurred. 
At the same time he found himself a bit surprised that so much of what the princess had said and done had stuck so firmly in his memory. 
I wasn't. 
you were what?" Nothing." 
That's all? 
A mere scratch, my Lady," Mandorallen replied indifferently. 
I just wanted to advise you not to make any longterm plans. 
"We can't get through." 
"We'd just bring more of it down on top of us. It probably fell in on her as wellat least we can hope so." 
The Ulgo turned to regard the little man. 
"She has water there and sufficient air to breathe. 
"I'd have to touch herput my hands on her. 
"Just cover him and let him sleep." 
Relg stared at her and he began to tremble. Then he quickly turned, moved as far away from her as possible, and dropped to his knees, praying desperately and pressing his face against the rocky floor of the cave. 
Rak Cthol's falling to pieces up there, and there isn't enough left of Ctuchik to make a smudge on the floor." Dead?" she gasped. 
I'll take care of it," Relg said quietly, breaking off his praying and getting to his feet. 
I'll go with you," Barak offered. 
"Then I want to have a look at the cut on your leg, Mandorallen." 
Then she turned her attention to the little boy. 
He returned her grave look with one just as serious, then reached out and touched the white lock at her brow with curious fingers. 
"Hettar's going to be waiting for us in the Valealong with King ChoHag and half the clans of Algaria. 
They rested in the cave through the remainder of the day, taking turns on watch at the narrow opening. 
When the time comes, we'll just put him on his horse," Polgara replied. 
"Or nights in this case. 
We don't look all that much like Murgos." 
Put out those torches. 
They were inescapable in view of the hordes of Murgos scouring the wasteland in search of them, but Silk handled each such meeting smoothly, and the night passed without significant incident. 
"Sloppy work tends to be habitforming." As the first steelgray light of dawn began to creep across the wintry sky, they took shelter among the boulders of one of the ridges that laced the floor of the wasteland. 
Why did you call him that?" Silk asked curiously. 
Errand?" the child asked, offering the Orb to Durnik. 
Sin, sin, sin!" she flared. 
I guard against it every moment." 
"Don't ever speak UL's name again!" 
She continued to unfasten the front of the dress. 
Relg's eyes were bulging now. 
It was the only weapon I had in the slave pens," she told him. 
"The finer points were very interesting. 
But the old man had already drifted back into sleep. 
As he walked quietly down to where the little man sat, Garion noticed that Aunt Pol slept with Errand in her arms, and he pushed away a momentary surge of jealousy. 
"Step back, Garion." 
"Listen to me, all of you," she said. 
She raised her hand. 
Garion could actually feel the barrier encircling her. 
THERE WAS THE faintest sliver of a moon low over the horizon as they started out across the black sand of the wasteland in the biting chill. 
He knew that there had been no need for it, since they all knew where they were going and what they had to do. 
"It's up to you of course, Garion, but if we exterminate all the Murgos in the area, there won't be anyone left to report our direction back to Rak Cthol, will there?" 
I just wanted to be sure you understood, that's all." 
Leave me alone," he told her harshly. 
Garion resisted an impulse to swear. "Please, Taiba," he said as calmly as he could, "just leave him alone." 
"I wasn't hurting him." 
Don't get overconfident," the voice advised dryly, and then it was gone. 
There seemed to be some kind of capacity, a limit beyond which most sorcerers could not go. 
Garion realized with a certain surprise that he was already stronger than men who had been practicing this art for centuries, and that he was only beginning to touch the edges of his talent. 
Aunt Pol, her horse, and the little boy all seemed to vanish as absolute blackness engulfed them. 
One of the walls of the room had a large crack in it, and part of the ceiling had collapsed as a result of the earthquake that had convulsed Rak Cthol. 
The darkness surrounding Aunt Pol disappeared. 
Somebody had to do something," Garion protested. 
The broken wall of peaks that marked the western edge of the waste land was clearly visible as the light began to creep up the eastern sky. 
"Two or three leagues at least," he judged. 
Not only did the cares of leadership press heavily on him, but he also felt apprehensive about the possibility of an attack by the Hierarchs coming while he was asleep. 
As the others began to unroll their blankets, he walked about rather aimlessly, stopping to look at Aunt Pol, who sat with her back against a large rock, holding the sleeping Errand and looking as distant as the moon behind her shimmering shield. 
"I think we could all use a week's rest in a good pasture." 
Durnik looked out at the long shadows of the ridge stretching away from the newly risen sun. 
After it was over, he realized that I wasn't a coward after all. 
Durnik was his oldest friendsomebody he could always count on. 
If you do that, sooner or later somebody will come along who'll misunderstand, and you'll have to do something to show him that it's not him that you're afraid of. When it goes that far, it's usually much worse for youand for him, too." 
Who says so?" the thin old man drawled insultingly. 
And just who are you?" 
And what will you do if we don't?" The old man's face was filled with contemptuous amusement. 
Garion ground his insubstantial teeth and drew himself in with dreadful concentration. 
Destroy it." 
He could feel the heart flutter like a terrified bird and the lungs falter as the Hierarch's breath stopped and he gaped with horror at the arm sticking out of his chest. 
The purple haze was gone; strangely enough, he didn't even feel tired. 
Durnik drew in a shuddering breath and struggled to rise. 
Not bad," Belgarath said. The old man was sitting up. 
Quite suddenly he laughed; smiling, he looked into Garion's face. 
It's not too likely that I'm going to be put in charge of things very often." 
The dark expanse of the wasteland behind them was dotted with the watch fires of the Murgos, and far back along their trail they saw moving torches. 
Let's hope they don't lose it again," the old man replied. "Not too likely, really. 
I'll take them," Silk suggested as he reined in. 
Where are you going?" Barak asked him. 
"Then I'll double back and make sure that you haven't left any tracks. 
you want some company?" the big man offered. Silk shook his head. "I can move faster alone." 
Be careful." Silk grinned. 
"Is it always this cold?" she asked, her large, violet eyes very wide. 
In the wintertime," he replied. 
The twisting streambed made a sharp bend to the right, and they rode into the light of the newly risen sun. 
"I didn't know that the sun could be so bright." 
It was the light we were afraid of. 
Since they had left Rak Cthol, Garion had covertly watched these two. 
you can bear the dark if you aren't alone." 
I must have been almost a woman, though, because not long after that the Murgos gave me to a slave who had pleased them. 
you should have fought," Relg declared adamantly. 
If somebody forces you to do something and there's no possible way to avoid it, is it really sin?" 
He faltered, unable to face that gaze. Abruptly he turned his mount and rode back toward the pack animals. 
"you could even say that the way Ce'Nedra and I quarrel all the time is necessary too, couldn't you?" 
She looked slightly amused. 
And the Angaraks would win, and there'd be Grolims everywhere with their knives and their altars." 
Finally, about noon on a cold, sunless day when the wind was kicking up dust clouds along the horizon, they reached the broad, arid valley through which the south caravan route wound. 
They took cover behind a low hill while Silk rode on ahead to take a quick look. 
We could always go on to that ravine we followed coming up," Silk suggested. 
But Lord Hettar and the Algar clans of King ChoHag await us in the Vale," Mandorallen objected. 
All right," Belgarath said firmly, "we'll use the ravine. 
"Can you see any signs of the Algars?" he asked Barak, who was staring out at the plain below. 
"Durnik knows how to build a small fire and keep it hidden." 
I'll strike the tents," Durnik said. 
Durnik sounded shocked. 
Some of them," Silk admitted. 
Now I guess I'll have to start all over again." 
Then Polgara stopped and raised her face. "Father," she said calmly, "they've found the top of the ravine." 
Then there was a familiar surge and roaring sound. A rock, somewhat larger than a man's head, went whistling over him, angling sharply up out of the cut to fall harmlessly far out on the tumbled debris at the floor of the escarpment. 
About twenty yards above Belgarath, it struck solidly and spun into the air. The old man gestured irritably, grunting with the effort, and the rock sailed out in a long arc, clearing the walls of the ravine and falling out of sight. 
"you don't just jump in with help until you're asked. 
"And they're going to be dropping boulders off the edge up there before long. 
Like what?" Silk asked the smith. 
Durnik nodded with satisfaction. "Just like a chimney," he observed. 
If Taur Urgas is up there, he's going to send people after us, even if he has to throw them off the cliff personally. 
At least it slowed them down a bit," Belgarath said. 
Does anybody have any idea how we're going to find that ford in the dark?" Durnik asked. 
The rest of the night promises to be moderately unpleasant," Silk observed, shaking one sodden foot. 
At least you've got the river between you and Taur Urgas," Barak reminded him. 
That does brighten things up a bit," Silk admitted. 
My guess is that he's going to hold the bulk of his army on the far side," Belgarath told them after they had all dismounted. 
He paced up and down, his hands clasped together behind his back and an angry look on his face. 
He kicked at the tall grass. "This isn't turning out too well," he admitted glumly. 
We're fairly close." 
How hard can we push the horses without hurting them?" Silk asked him. 
I know," Belgarath replied, "and that's the one thing I've wanted to avoid. 
The rumble that came then could not possibly have been thunder. 
I'd give a great deal to see the look on his face just now." Silk laughed. 
We corrected that, however. The whole affair set off an earthquake. 
Where's Hettar?" Barak asked. 
"Their rear guard got cut off, and they're out there trying to find someplace to hide." 
Her hands were at Belgarath's wrist and brow, feeling for his pulse. 
She peeled back one of his eyelids and stared intently into his blank, unseeing eyes. 
I should have been watching him." 
Take it out and burn itbowl and alland don't let anyone get into the smoke from it." 
Then I want a screen of some kind around the bedblankets will do. 
THE WAGON SEEMED barely to crawl. 
"What's wrong?" Garion asked in a sharp whisper. 
I'd really rather stay, Aunt Pol." 
That might be a good sign, you know." 
Durnik nodded and changed the wagon's direction. 
It was a vast, towering fortress rearing out of the duncolored hills. 
Quite possibly, but they come here anyway because they can't resist the place. 
How's grandfather?" 
Everything's ready, Polgara," Queen Silar told her. 
Errand laughed and held out his hand. 
She said nothing as she took the child, but her expression told him plainly that something very important had just happened. 
She had long, dark brown hair, and the eyes she had fixed on Garion were gray, calm, and very serious. 
He had the peculiar feeling that he ought to know her. 
Just don't bounce him around," Polgara cautioned. 
Aunt Pol turned to Garion, her eyes grave. "Stay for a few moments, dear," she asked, and he remained as the others all quietly left. 
"This has to be kept strictly between us." 
This series of events is different, however. 
Garion nodded and beckoned to the child. 
you're Garion, aren't you?" she asked. 
I was then," Garion replied. 
Supper should be ready soon." 
I presume that your Majesty will wish to place it in the hands of the priesthood for safekeeping." 
Elvar's eyes bulged and he recoiled from the Orb, lifting his hands above his head to avoid touching it. 
"We thoughtthat isI" 
Make him put it away, Durnik," Polgara told the smith. 
"I told you he'd be all right," he exclaimed delightedly. 
He's already complaining about lumps in the bed and demanding strong ale." 
IN THE DAyS that followed while the others rested and Aunt Pol nursed Belgarath back to health, Garion and his cousin spent every waking moment together. 
But Adara was different. 
She showed him the Algar Stronghold from top to bottom. 
At first I didn't want to believe it, but things kept happening because I wanted them to happen, It finally reached the point where I couldn't doubt it any more." 
"It makes a certain kind of noise, you see, and Aunt Pol can hear it. For some reason I don't think she'd approve if I just did it to show off." 
you're not afraid of her, are you?" 
He considered that. 
We had an awful argument oncein Nyissa. 
She's given up every single thing that's ever been important to her for me. Can you imagine the kind of obligation that puts on me? 
"Nothing yet. 
That was before," he snapped, his eyes popping open. 
Prolonged bed rest had never been her favorite form of therapy. 
She had always wanted her patients ambulatory as soon as possible. 
"yes?" he said through the door, quickly pulling on his shirt and hose. 
I'll meet you in the west stables." 
"It will be savage in the mountains of Ulgo." 
"Go ahead and enjoy your ride." 
The grass beneath their horses' hooves was brown and lifeless, lying dormant under the winter sky. 
It's only a bush, Garion." 
It had all come from within him, and there had been a deep and peculiar love in it. lt's lovely," Adara said, holding the little flower gently in her cupped hands and inhaling its fragrance. 
Who's Ce'Nedra?" she asked suddenly. 
When her mood was pensive, she and the Gorim sometimes took short walks to view the strange splendors of this subterranean world of cave and gallery and cavern beneath the abandoned city of Prolgu. 
She discovered that the core of Ulgo life was religion, and that the moral and theme of all their stories was the duty of absolute submission to the will of UL. 
Impulsively, as if to prove her point, she kissed his pale cheek fondly. 
That left only the waiting, the seemingly endless, unendurable waiting for her friends. 
Then there was the problem of her hair. 
She worked on it until her arms ached from being raised over her head for so long. 
Her voice was vibrant, musical. 
An Imperial Princess did not cry. 
She paused only once, just as she passed Garion. "I hope you'll be very happy," she lied to him. 
She heard a light step near the doorway, and then the Lady Polgara was there. 
His cousin?" Ce'Nedra's tearstreaked face came up suddenly. 
"Our princess, as you've probably noticed, is somewhat highstrung." I'm so sorry that I ran off like that," Ce'Nedra apologized to Adara. 
Ce'Nedra lifted her chin. "Oh yes I can," she declared. 
His expression was confused, even a trifle hurt. 
While Belgarath and Lady Polgara were recounting the events of their harrowing journey to Rak Cthol, the princess sat demurely beside Adara on a bench, half listening, but for the most part turning the amazing discovery of the past hour over and over in her mind. 
The little blond boy Lady Polgara called Errand was watching her, his small face very serious. 
Durnik looked a bit embarrassed and was about to lead the child away, but Errand pulled his hand free and climbed instead into Ce'Nedra's lap. 
The word "Riva" jerked Ce'Nedra out of her reverie. 
"The legionnaires will be able to make arrangements to return me to Tol Honeth." 
you're wrong, however. 
Polgara said nothing, but her eyes seemed very wise as she watched the princess flounder. 
"The horses think it's about noon, but their idea of time is a bit imprecise." 
Groups of country militia drilled in the brown slush in village squares; old swords and bent pikes, long forgotten in dusty attics or damp cellars, had been located and scraped free of rust in preparation for the war everyone knew was coming. 
Their homemade uniforms were in every possible shade of red or blue or green, and their brightcolored banners obviously showed that treasured petticoats had been sacrificed to the cause. 
Though young men strutted in their uniforms for the benefit of village girls, and older men tried to look like veterans, the atmosphere in each village was grave. 
Doesn't she ever listen to anybody?" the little princess grumbled to Garion as they rode along behind Aunt Pol and Durnik on the road to Medalia. 
The princess drew in a quick breath as if preparing to retort. 
I wouldn't," Garion advised her softly. 
I don't care about my clothes, Rundorig. 
He stared curiously at Garion. 
"Where did you get such fine things? 
And Zubrette well, Zubrette and I started walking out together not too long after you left." 
"I think she'd endure anything to be with you." 
A thousand memories flooded over Garion all at once, together with an actual pain at what he had to do. 
Garion's look, however, feigned friendship, affection even, but no love. 
He exchanged a quick glance with Rundorig that said all that needed saying, then he sadly watched the departure of the girl he had always thought that one day he might marry. 
When she turned a corner and disappeared, he sighed rather bitterly, turned back and found Ce'Nedra's eyes on him. 
Does Lady Polgara really like to cook that much?" 
There was something peculiar and rather comforting about holding her hand. 
"Everybody here seems to be busy every single moment." 
"yes," he said, "it did, sort of, but it was best for all of us, I think. 
Maybe it's because you're braver." 
Well what?" 
A sudden thought had occurred to Garion, however. 
"It didn't hurt her, and she saw some things there that were important for her to see." 
Great waves ran before the wind, their tops ripped to frothy tatters. 
He jabbed an angry finger toward the window. 
Try to keep your composure." 
you don't really expect me to answer a question like that, do you, Grandfather? Not right here in front of her?" 
A little choppy," Greldik admitted with an indifferent shrug. 
Everything will be all right, Layla," Polgara kept repeating over and over again, trying to calm the agitated little queen. 
you can if it makes you happy, dear," Polgara said sweetly, patting the plump little queen gently on the cheek. 
The cabin belowdecks was crowded, and Garion spent most of his time topside, trying to stay out of the wind and out from under the sailors' feet at the same time. 
Garion thought he recognized Tolnedrans and a few Drasnian merchants moving quickly through the little enclave in the raw wind. The city itself rose sharply up the steep slope upon which it was built, each succeeding row of gray stone houses towering over the ones below. 
The windows facing out toward the harbor were all very narrow and very high up in the buildings, and Garion could see the tactical advantage of such construction. The terraced city was a series of successive barriers. 
Each terrace would be as impregnable as the main wall. 
The blue and white swordbanners of Riva stood out stiffly in the wind above the fortress, outlined sharply against the dark gray clouds scudding across the winter sky. 
King Anheg of Cherek, clad in fur, and Brand, the Rivan Warder, wearing his gray cloak, stood on the wharf before the city gates waiting for them as Greldik's sailors rowed the ship smartly up to the wharf. 
Garion looked at his friend's face dubiously. 
"you'd say that even if you were bleeding to death, Lelldorin." 
His eyes glowed as he spoke of her. 
What are you doing here in Riva?" Garion demanded. 
The blond Mimbrate girl who nursed you back to health?" 
you remember her," Lelldorin sounded very pleased about that. 
I think I'm ready for the worst now." 
I knew that he'd be honorbound to try to stop us," Lelldorin explained. 
The others had all disembarked and were preparing to follow Brand and King Anheg up the steep, snowcovered stairs toward the upper levels of the city. 
So that's why you think Aunt Pol might be cross with you," Garion said as he and Lelldorin fell in at the rear of the group. 
The priest did have it coming, though," Lelldorin declared hotly. 
As Lelldorin described his disastrous journey through Arendia, Garion glanced curiously at the city of Riva. 
There were, however, some very interesting smells coming from kitchens where Erastide feasts simmered and roasted under the watchful eyes of the women of Riva. 
Hettar's the one who actually killed Nachak. 
We did manage to keep your nameand Torasin'sout of it." 
"Poppa," the youngest of the two squealed, running to Barak. 
I expect that will come in time," Barak assured her. He dells a lot," Gundred reported, "and he hasn't got any teeth." 
Her expression was one of pride. 
She extended the bundle. "Behold your son Unrak, Trellheim's heir." 
Very gently, his great fingers trembling, he turned back the blanket to gaze for the first time at his son's face. 
Merel's eyes seemed almost startled, and her expression was unreadable. 
This is my son Unrak," Barak announced to the rest of them, holding the baby up so that they could see him. 
What's the matter with your friend?" It was the Princess Ce'Nedra, and she was tugging on Garion's sleeve. 
"Well, Lelldorin's very enthusiastic about things, and sometimes he speaks or acts without stopping to think." 
Belgarath shook his head stubbornly. "There are reasons, Anheg," he said. 
Even the storm seemed to be mixed up in itlike some howling enemy trying with noise and wind and crashing waves to break the absolute concentration necessary to complete each task. 
Garion smiled at his friend, and Rundorig grinned back. 
That's right," Aunt Pol said encouragingly. 
This time it caught in the tinder. The young Asturian blew on it, and it grew brighter, then flared into a small finger of flame. 
"It feels like this night's already been about ten years long." 
Talking's better than lying here in the dark, jumping at every sound," Garion agreed, sitting up and pulling his blanket around his shoulders. 
There wasn't one single thing you did that was actually insane. 
Why don't we try to sleep again?" Garion suggested. 
In his hand he held a dead twig and a few wisps of dry grass. 
"It's not a very good flower, is it?" he apologized. It will have to do," the voice told him. 
He felt oddly lightheaded, as if his troubled sleep had done him more harm than good. 
"Weather could smell differently here on this island, though." 
"If anyone wants me, I'll be here." 
Adara was there and Taiba, Queen Layla and Ariana, the Mimbrate girl; in the center of the room stood Princess Ce'Nedra. 
you're up early," Aunt Pol observed, her needle flickering as she made some minute modification to Ce'Nedra's creamy gown. 
Then she turned and looked rather critically at her reflection in the mirror. "I'm still not convinced about the braiding, Lady Polgara," she fretted. 
"Grandfather said that we weren't going to take the Orb to the throne room until noon." 
That's not really that far off, Garion," Aunt Pol told him, biting a thread and stepping back to look critically at Ce'Nedra's dress. 
The Ulgo zealot looked at the old man, then walked over to the stone wall beside the large window. 
I'll go along," Lelldorin said, and the three of them quietly left the room. 
There were but few torches and only one attendant who wordlessly handed them towels and then went off into the steam to manage the valves that adjusted the water temperature. 
Are you sure we'll be alone here?" Garion asked nervously. 
"The Rivans are very proper about that sort of thing. 
They aren't nearly as advanced as the Tolnedrans yet." 
There was no hint of the usual amusement in the voice, and the formality seemed strange, significant. 
Thank you, " Garion replied gravely, and they did not speak again. 
Aunt Pol wore a deep blue robe, cowled and belted at the waist. 
He looked at her, baffled. "I had the oddest dream last night," he said. 
I can live with them, Old Wolf" 
Let's go then." 
Barak was there and Lelldorin, Hettar, Durnik, Silk, and Mandorallen. 
In the searing blue light of the Orb and with the strange sound shimmering in his ears, Garion looked in wonder at his friends, realizing with amazement that he was seeing for the first time what Belgarath and Aunt Pol had seen all along. 
He stepped up onto the seat of the basalt throne and then onto the wide ledge formed by its back and arms. He stretched up, taking hold of the huge sword hilt to steady himself, and placed the Orb on the great sword's pommel. 
All hail Belgarion, King of Riva and Overlord of the West!" And yet in the midst of the turmoil that followed and even with the shimmering chorus of what seemed a million million voices raised in an exultation echoing from one end of the universe to the other, there was a sullen clang of iron as if the rustscoured door of some dark tomb had suddenly burst open, and the sound of that clanging chilled Garion's heart. 
Stunned past all thought, Garion stood with his flaming sword aloft as, with a steely rustle, the assembled Alorns unsheathed their swords to raise them in salute. 
There was, moreover, the sure and certain knowledge that as soon as he arose, he was going to be the absolute center of attention. 
The more he thought about that, the better it sounded. 
Garion burrowed quickly back under the covers. 
Garion did not like being followed, whatever the reason, but he resisted the urge to turn around and tell the man to go away. 
Do we have to do this?" I can't imagine what your Majesty is talking about." 
you taught me how to read yourself," he reminded her, "about six or eight months ago. 
"Wait just a moment. I'll be right back." 
It was almost an accusation. I didn't say that." 
And without waiting for an answer, she swept from the room. 
May I come in?" 
She had undone the rather severe braids she customarily wore, and her blond hair framed her face softly. 
Merel threw him a quick, almost shy smile. 
Garion nodded. "I think it might have something to do with the way he trusts everybody," he suggested. 
"Walk up and down the halls and listen for the rattle of dice. 
That makes me even more nervous," he replied. 
Irritated finally to the point where he no longer cared about concealing his identity, Garion turned to confront his pursuer. "I know you're there," he declared. 
The servant shook his head. "I haven't seen anyone since I left the apartments of the King of Drasnia," he replied. 
Please don't do that, Lelldorin," Garion told him. 
I saw him earlier this morning," Lelldorin replied. 
I seem to have lost track of several hours." 
I've got a problem," Garion blurted. 
I'm sure they'll give you time to get used to the idea," Lelldorin said. 
She doesn't actually dislike you," Silk told him. 
I suppose it helps relieve the boredom. 
Not far up that street a large building stood solidly on the downhill side. Silk strode up to the door and knocked. 
"He doesn't even measure when he mixes, and the colors always come out exactly right. 
"I was in the square yesterday when Brand introduced you to the people," he explained. 
What's your name?" Garion asked curiously. 
Joran grinned at him. 
Polgara the Sorceress?" 
Can she really turn herself into a dragon?" I suppose she could if she wanted to," Garion admitted, "but she prefers the shape of an owl. 
The palace, an old, low, Syrian building of whitened mud, is not so ugly as Buckingham Palace; and the officers in the courtyard are more highly civilized than modern English officers: for example, they do not dig up the corpses of their dead enemies and mutilate them, as we dug up Cromwell and the Mahdi. 
Is rather to be pitied just now in view of the fact that Julius Caesar is invading his country. 
 By Apis, Persian, thy gods are good to thee. THE PERSIAN. 
He bears evil tidings. 
Who art thou that laughest in the House of Cleopatra the Queen, and in the teeth of Belzanor, the captain of her guard? 
THE SENTINEL (who has been listening). 
They care nothing about cowardice, these Romans: they fight to win. 
Tell us the tale of the battle. 
Nay, more: we found that Caesar is already come; for we had not made half a day's journey on our way back when we came upon a city rabble flying from his legions, whose landing they had gone out to withstand. 
But there came the sound of a trumpet whose voice was as the cursing of a black mountain. Then saw we a moving wall of shields coming towards us. 
Every man of them flung his javelin: the one that came my way drove through my shield as through a papyruslo there! (he points to the bandage on his left arm) and would have gone through my neck had I not stooped. 
They were charging at the double then, and were upon us with short swords almost as soon as their javelins. 
Leaving the descendants of the gods to be butchered! 
BELZANOR (awestruck at his brain power). 
 Will you not await her command? 
A girl of sixteen! Not we. 
It is true: the Queen's guard cannot live on its pay. 
Caesar is by this time almost within earshot. 
He will conquer and kill her brother, and reign in Egypt with Cleopatra for his Queen. 
Belzanor's voice dominates the disturbance as he shouts) Back there. 
She is dressed like a person of consequence in the palace, and confronts the guardsmen insolently. 
Then fly and save yourselves, O cowardly sons of the cheap clay gods that are sold to fish porters; and leave us to shift for ourselves. 
You have frightened the child: she is hiding. 
The guards, led by Belzanor, shoulder their way into the palace through the flying crowd of women, who escape through the courtyard gate. 
(To Ftatateeta, very significantly) Mother: your gods are asleep or away hunting; and the sword is at your throat. 
Which way come the Romans? 
Then the blackness and stillness breaks softly into silver mist and strange airs as the windswept harp of Memnon plays at the dawning of the moon. 
Silence: then a few faint highringing trumpet notes. 
Then a man comes from the south with stealing steps, ravished by the mystery of the night, all wonder, and halts, lost in contemplation, opposite the left flank of the Sphinx, whose bosom, with its burden, is hidden from him by its massive shoulder.) 
"Old gentleman: don't run away!!!" 
CAESAR (running forward past the Sphinx's shoulder, and seeing her). 
I brought him here to sacrifice him to the Sphinx; but when we got a little way from the city a black cat called him, and he jumped out of my arms and ran away to it. 
But this isn't the great Sphinx. 
Why, the great Sphinx is so big that it has a temple between its paws. 
Would you like me to show you a real Roman? 
It is not a dream: it is not a dream. 
(Whimpering) I only wanted to show youCAESAR (gently). 
Come, come: don't cry. 
CLEOPATRA (flinging her arms in terror round him). 
(With a piercing scream she springs up; darts round the left shoulder of the Sphinx; scrambles down to the sand; and falls on her knees in frantic supplication, shrieking) Bite him in two, Sphinx: bite him in two. 
(He turns contemptuously from her.) 
It is the bucina, the Roman war trumpet.) 
Do you feel the earth shaking? CAESAR. 
It is the tread of Caesar's legions. 
And let us look for the white cat as we go. 
Order the slave to light the lamps. 
FTATATEETA (suddenly coming from behind the throne). 
(He turns to go.) 
(He points to the floor at Cleopatra's feet. 
Caesar takes his sword by the scabbard, ready to offer the hilt to the Nubian, and turns again to Ftatateeta, repeating his gesture.) 
Caesar makes a bound and manages to catch her and hold her while Ftatateeta escapes.) 
Come: take your place. 
CLEOPATRA (eagerlyrecovering herself a little). 
Are you trembling? CLEOPATRA (shivering with dread). 
FTATATEETA (contemptuously). 
The Nubian comes running down the hall. 
Cleopatra can hardly restrain herself from following them. 
Cleopatra's terror increases. 
The clean lofty walls, painted with a procession of the Egyptian theocracy, presented in profile as flat ornament, and the absence of mirrors, sham perspectives, stuffy upholstery and textiles, make the place handsome, wholesome, simple and cool, or, as a rich English manufacturer would express it, poor, bare, ridiculous and unhomely. 
The court is assembled to receive him. 
He has fine tawny hair, like fur. 
POTHINUS (suppressing his impatience with difficulty). 
POTHINUS (suddenly exploding with all the force and emphasis of political passion). 
(A shout of applause.) 
Tell the King, Achillas, how many soldiers and horsemen follow the Roman? 
Health and many victories, Achillas! 
The council chamber of the chancellors of the King's treasury, Caesar. 
That reminds me. I want some money. 
Bring a chair there, some of you, for Caesar. 
Then take warning, Caesar. 
And their wrath be on your head, Caesar, if you force us to this sacrilege! 
Will the Queen favor us with her presence for a moment? 
CAESAR (touched by Ptolemy's distress). 
Be quiet. Open your mouth again before I give you leave; and you shall be eaten. CLEOPATRA. 
RUFIO. Hear Caesar there. 
Caesar remains unruffled; but Rufio grows fiercer and doggeder, and Britannus haughtily indignant. 
Are your men Romans? 
If not, it matters not how many there are, provided you are no stronger than 500 to ten. 
Won't you cut their heads off? 
I could do no less, Pothinus, to secure the retreat of my own soldiers. 
Renegades and all? 
CAESAR (shrinking). 
As Pompey's foot touched the Egyptian shore, his head fell by the stroke of my sword. 
We have given you a full and sweet measure of vengeance. 
 No, by the gods! 
What a fool was I then! 
RUFIO. A Caesarian, like all Caesar's soldiers. 
I have no right to suppose that his ways are any baser than mine. 
CAESAR (laughing approvingly). 
Then I consent to stay, because I am asked. 
(Calling) Totateeta. 
CLEOPATRA (with a splutter of laughter). 
(Ftatateeta instantly rises and comes to Cleopatra.) 
CAESAR (stumbling over the name). 
Engage women to attend upon her; and do all that is needful. 
But he was a great King, and cut off my sister's head because she rebelled against him and took the throne from him. 
I will tell you. 
A beautiful young man, with strong round arms, came over the desert with many horsemen, and slew my sister's husband and gave my father back his throne. 
But you want Mark Antony to come from it. 
(He is startled by the entry of a wounded Roman soldier, who confronts him from the upper step.) 
What now? 
 Now or tomorrow: what does it matter? 
We have not got it, Rufio. 
Are those ships burnt yet? 
 He waits without. CAESAR. Ho there! 
Pothinus appears in the loggia, and comes down the hall very haughtily to Caesar's left hand. 
I have brought you our ultimatum, Caesar. 
Otherwise my soldiers, who do not share my celebrated clemency, will probably kill you. 
Britannus: Pass the word to the guard; and fetch my armor. 
Forgive me, Rufio; and (anxiously) hurry them as much asHe is interrupted by an outcry as of an old man in the extremity of misfortune. 
Woe, alas! 
Without history, death would lay you beside your meanest soldier. 
POTHINUS (significantly). 
RUFIO (shouting from the loggia to the beach). 
A CENTURION (from below). 
Cleopatra, runs in through the loggia with Caesar's helmet and sword, snatched from Britannus, who follows her with a cuirass and greaves. 
You must not speak in this manner to Caesar. 
This is your accursed clemency, Caesar. 
Theodotus has brought them. 
The island is joined to the main land by the Heptastadium, a great mole or causeway five miles long bounding the harbor on the south. 
His sword, designed as carefully as a medieval cross, has a blued blade showing through an openwork scabbard of purple leather and filagree. 
Apollodorus: rebuke this Roman dog; and bid him bridle his tongue in the presence of Ftatateeta, the mistress of the Queen's household. 
I do not keep a shop. Mine is a temple of the arts. 
FTATATEETA (lifting him from the ground). 
Centurion: I am here by order of the Queen toCENTURION (interrupting him). 
But mind you pass no one out that you have not passed innot even the Queen herself. 
FTATATEETA (looking malignantly after him). 
We shall see whom Isis loves best: her servant Ftatateeta or a dog of a Roman. 
There are men here. 
Whither shall I row my Queen? 
(She makes for the steps.) 
You cannot pass. 
I will make Caesar have you killed if you do not obey me. SENTINEL. He will do worse to me if I disobey my officer. 
Apollodorus: make your slaves help us. 
(He draws his sword.) 
Roman against Sicilian, curse you. 
(He hurls his pilum at Apollodorus, who drops expertly on one knee. 
My military friend, I was not born to be slain by so ugly a weapon. 
And now that you are convinced that we do not want to go beyond the lines, let me finish killing your sentinel and depart with the Queen. 
I will not: I am the Queen. 
Have Caesar's centurions changed manners with his scullions? 
I will make amends for that insult with my sword at fitting time and place. 
Two more men to this post here; and see that no one leaves the palace but this man and his merchandize. 
Do they throw them down? 
SECOND AUXILIARY (in a half whisper, glancing apprehensively towards the north end of the quay). 
Patience, worthy threeheaded donkey. 
I do not need to be told what to do by the like of you. 
The Centurion and his guard run of northward; and immediately afterwards the bucina sounds. 
Peace, Roman fellow: you are now singlehanded. 
The porters carry the carpet to the steps. 
Oh thou injurious porter! 
The four porters have now come up and are waiting at the stairhead to be paid. 
What do you mean? 
My heart, my heart, be whole and free: Love is thine only enemy. 
Faggots like the one he sits on lie beneath it ready to be drawn up to feed the beacon. 
RUFIO. Well, my British islander. Have you been up to the top? BRITANNUS. 
I reckon it at 200 feet high. 
An old man and a boy work that! 
Twenty men, you mean. 
Two only, I assure you. 
Must I leave my food and go starving to bring you a report? 
(He gives way to melancholy contemplation, and eats another date.) 
(Britannus returns, greatly excited, with a leathern bag. 
Well, we shall now know who your foes are. 
Put them(he gasps)!!!! CAESAR. 
What Briton speaks as you do in your moments of levity? 
Well, well, my friend: some day I shall settle down and have a blue toga, perhaps. 
(Apollodorus comes past the lighthouse.) 
BRITANNUS (turning quickly, and challenging the stranger with official haughtiness). 
RUFI0 (appearing at the lighthouse door). 
As I approached the lighthouse, some fool threw a great leathern bag into the sea. It broke the nose of my boat; and I had hardly time to get myself and my charge to the shore before the poor little cockleshell sank. 
Well, well: what have you brought me? 
The Egyptians will let you know why not if they have the sense to make a rush from the shore end of the mole before our barricade is finished. 
And the old man will be there first. 
So peace; and give me some more dates. 
APOLLODORUS (from the causeway below). 
The chain rises clear of their heads with a rattle. 
Put up your swords. 
Britannus, scandalized, sheathes his sword with a drive of protest. 
Oh, I'm smothered. 
We shall have to go away presently and cut some of your Egyptians' heads off. 
I will hail one if I can: that is all I can do. 
The Egyptians have landed from the west harbor between us and the barricade!!! 
RUFIO (running to see). 
I have murdered them. 
Defend yourselves here until I send you a boat from that galley. 
You shall not. 
Old!!! 
I will race you to the galley for a week's pay, father Rufio. 
CLEOPATRA (running excitedly to the steps). 
(He pitches her screaming into the sea. 
RUFIO (looking down after her). 
CLEOPATRA (to the old musician). 
I want to learn to play the harp with my own hands. 
Can you teach me? 
How long will it take? MUSICIAN. 
After that, whenever I strike a false note you shall be flogged; and if I strike so many that there is not time to flog you, you shall be thrown into the Nile to feed the crocodiles. 
The ladies laugh.) 
Well, Pothinus: what is the latest news from your rebel friends? 
I am no friend of rebellion. 
You are no more a prisoner than I amthan Caesar is. 
Shall I tell you how to grow much older, and much, MUCH wiser in one day? 
Begone, all of you. 
Now that Caesar has made me wise, it is no use my liking or disliking; I do what must be done, and have no time to attend to myself. 
His kindness to me is a wonder: neither mother, father, nor nurse have ever taken so much care for me, or thrown open their thoughts to me so freely. 
When he will do as much for the first girl he meets on his way back to Rome? 
 I do not understand this man? 
Your Majesty caused me to be admitted today. 
CLEOPATRA (with scorn, getting up to go). 
May your tongue wither for that wish! 
FTATATEETA (suspiciously). 
Light curtains are drawn between the columns on the north and east to soften the westering sun. 
The Roman commander will await Caesar here. 
 We are on the palace roof, O Beloved of Victory! 
They place it near the northmost of the two curtained columns. 
RUFIO. Who is to dine with usbesides Cleopatra? 
Oh, this military life! this tedious, brutal life of action! 
I advise you to see him: there is some plotting going on here among the women. 
I daresay you will do what you like. 
I will deal plainly. 
CAESAR (gently urging him to come to the point). 
My friend: when a man has anything to tell in this world, the difficulty is not to make him tell it, but to prevent him from telling it too often. 
(Caesar rises loftily.) 
Pass the prisoner out. 
From her own lips I have heard it. 
Do I resent the wind when it chills me, or the night when it makes me stumble in the darkness? 
To tell me such a story as this is but to tell me that the sun will rise tomorrow. 
PothCLEOPATRA (striking her on the mouth). 
You shall not see my face until his eyes are darkened. 
Truth, Apollodorus? 
What are we to have? 
CLEOPATRA (at the opposite end). 
I have got new ones for you. 
Sea hedgehogs, black and white sea acorns, sea nettles, beccaficoes, purple shellfishCAESAR. 
All posterity will bless you for it. 
RUFIO. Is there nothing solid to begin with? THE MAJORDOMO. 
Let us name the holy city, and consecrate it with Lesbian Wineand Cleopatra shall name it herself. 
It shall be called Caesar's Gift to his Beloved. 
The retinue withdraws, making obeisance. 
Go, I am a priestess, and have power to take your charge from you. 
(The priest makes a reverence and goes out.) 
Now let us call on the Nile all together. 
RUFIO. A man with a knife in him, I'll swear. 
CLEOPATRA (still in her place at the table). 
RUFIO (sitting down on the altar). 
CLEOPATRA (sinking back trembling on the bench and covering her face with her hands). 
If one man in all Alexandria can be found to say that I did wrong, I swear to have myself crucified on the door of the palace by my own slaves. 
(Loftily wrapping himself up in an impenetrable dignity.) 
Let the Queen of Egypt now give her orders for vengeance, and take her measures for defense; for she has renounced Caesar. 
Has it come to this so suddenly, that nothing can save you now but pity? 
Apollodorus shows his sympathy with her by quietly posting himself behind the bench. 
CAESAR (turning on him and giving way to his wrath). 
RUFIO (greatly alarmed). 
Desperately, to Caesar) Will you desert us because we are a parcel of fools? 
At this point. 
I am busy now, my child, busy. 
The table has been removed. 
CLEOPATRA (wringing her hands and calling). 
A Roman guard is posted there in charge of a gangway, whence a red floorcloth is laid down the middle of the esplanade, turning off to the north opposite the central gate in the palace front, which shuts in the esplanade on the south side. 
BELZANOR (following him). 
You have not yet appointed a Roman governor for this province. 
I a governor! What are you dreaming of? 
BRITANNUS (coming forward on Caesar's right hand). 
Britannus, gratified, but a trifle shamefaced, takes his hand and kisses it sheepishly.) 
BELZANOR (to the Persian). 
There are too many daggers there. 
It is for your brother. 
What do you mean by my way? 
You have convinced me of it long ago. 
Rufio: had you set yourself in the seat of the judge, and with hateful ceremonies and appeals to the gods handed that woman over to some hired executioner to be slain before the people in the name of justice, never again would I have touched your hand without a shudder. 
(She laughs in spite of herself.) 
But it is so ridiculous to hear you call her Totateeta. 
CAESAR (coaxing). 
What are they, Caesar? 
"Give me your arm." 
Three.
That's my boy.
Hey, you're a clownfish.
All right. I know one joke.
He's in one place.
Be nice. It's his first time at school.
We call it his lucky fin.
See this tentacle? It's shorter than all my other tentacles.
Let's name the zones the zones, the zones Let's name the zones of the open sea Mr Ray.
Sing with me.
What's that? I know what that is.
He was too afraid.
Anything I can do? I am a scientist. Is there any problem? I didn't mean to interrupt.
Don't touch the boa...
No, they took him away. I have to find the boat.
You have?
And it passed by not too long ago.
The ocean isn't big enough for you?
Want a piece of me?
A boat? I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago.
You already told me which way the boat was going. I did?
See, I suffer from shortterm memory loss.
At least I think it does.
Parties are fun and it's tempting, but we can't because...
That's all that matters.
Fish are friends, not food.
Do you all have your friends?
My name is Bruce.
You're an inspiration to us.
What do these markings mean? I never knew my father.
Come here.
Fish are friends, not food.
There's got to be a way out.
You want that mask?
And I'll need more cotton rolls.
The human mouth is a disgusting place.
The picture broke.
Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.
You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out.
I love to swim And when you want to swim you want to... I'm going to get stuck with that song. It's in my head.
Sorry.
A light? Yeah.
What is it? It's so pretty. I... I'm feeling... happy.
The second line's ''42 Wallaby Way''.
P Sherman...
Follow me.
You have been called forth to the summit of Mount Wannahockaloogie to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tankhood.
Why do I have to tell you again? I don't get tired of it.
What are we?
No, he's a good guy.
He's lost his son Fabio.
You're winning.
Once you get in, swim to the bottom of the chamber.
Now, do you see a small opening? lnside it, you'll see a rotating fan.
Feed me more.
What are you talking about?
No way. What happened?
Then Nemo's dad, he swims out to the ocean and they bump into three sharks.
He scares them away by blowing them up.
Down into the dark. It's wicked dark there.
You're rats with wings...been looking for his boy, Nemo.
Nothing should be worth that. I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, kid.
That's it.
He took on a shark! I heard he took on three.
He gets to battle a jellyfish forest.
That took guts.
This tank will get plenty dirty in that time, but we have to help it along.
You're really cute, but I don't know what you're saying.
Right.
Okay, no one there.
He might be hungry.
Bubbles! I love the bubbles.
Sorry I'm late.
You can't speak whale.
How do you know something bad isn't going to happen? I don't.
Now we find the boat that took him.
What's it say? I can't hear you, Peach.
That's it for the escape plan.
My nerves can't take much more.
That would have been a nasty fall. I don't want to go bellyup!
No! I didn't come this far to be breakfast.
Hey, I know where your son i...
They're in the Amazon.
No, not the trash can! I found his dad.
Fishy?
He did it! I'm happy. Is he going to be okay?
This is our spot.
Are you all right? I don't know where I am. I don't know what's going on. I think I lost somebody, but I can't remember. It's okay. I'm looking for someone, too.
Where are we anyway?
He went this way.
Dory, you have to tell everybody to...
That's my dad.
Let's go! I'm going to win. No, you're not. I did it.
My own son beats me.
Not food!
You can let go now.
Now go have an adventure.
You call me Tom, will you?" 
But I'll take it out of her." 
They're closing the doors ! 
"Perhaps," he said. 
Turn east." 
This ought to be far enough," Belgarath said. 
Oh, I'm very glad. 
Better let me do the talking. 
Where do you want us to meet you?" Barak asked. 
I came as soon as I got the general idea of his message. I thought you'd want to know immediately." We appreciate your concern," Aunt Pol said. 
What did you say your name was, boy?" 
"Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to prove yourself? 
"How do you think they'd feel if they knew you were competing in the Triwizard Tournament? 
He pulled out the scarlet Chinese Fireball. 
"Because I don't mind sharing a few pointers, if you'd like them, you know. 
Anything I can do to help..." 
Harry walked back to the tent and saw Cedric emerging from it, greener than ever. 
Though she writhed and twisted, furling and unfurling her wings and keeping those fearsome yellow eyes on Harry, she was afraid to move too far from them... but he had to persuade her to do it, or he'd never get near them.... 
Harry rose a few more feet, and she let out a roar of exasperation. 
"Oh right," said Harry. 
When the next song ended, everybody applauded once more, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor McGonagall's hand and make his way back through the crowds, at which point Fred and George accosted him. 
Everything going all right?" 
"Nice seeing you all. 
Good luck, Harry." 
Reckon something's up? 
Think we should do a bit of digging? 
A few people looked around. 
"Professor Moody?" he said again. 
Come along! 
Be what? 
As soon as you step outside that door......you'll start feeling better. 
You're running a big risk," Sophie said, "by helping us. 
"I thought so. 
At Sophie's suggestion. 
"Silas, take the keystone from Mr. Langdon." 
Silas nodded. 
She realized she was trembling. 
"Fortunately, Robert, your involvement turned out to be my saving grace. 
Rather than the keystone remaining locked in the depository bank forever, you extracted it and walked into my home." 
The community of Grail historians is small, and Teabing and I have a history together. 
Whether it was the keystone itself, or information on where to find it, I was not sure. 
"Getting up early all the time", he thought, "it makes you stupid. You've got to get enough sleep. 
'Easy,' said George. 
'You'll see, little bro',' said Fred, as he and George got up again. 
He can make up his own mind.' 
Harrys insides plummeted sickeningly. 
Listen, Harryperhaps we should leave it here for tonight. 
Harry followed him downstairs, trying to wipe his hands clean on the inside of his robes without Snape noticing. 
"You're wrong," said Lupin. "I haven't been Sirius's friend, but I am nowLet me explain...." 
"Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed.... 
James would have understood, Harry... he would have shown me mercy..." 
"Do you deny it?" 
"But you believe us." 
Then he turned to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. 
There was a knock on Hagrid's front door. 
Harry watched the grass flatten in patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating. 
"Weerhave to read you the official notice of execution, Hagrid. 
He explained what he'd seen; how, as the nearest dementor had lowered its mouth to Harry's, a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat. 
Now they could hear angry voices, growing louder and louder. 
What do they think they're doing?" 
So don't blame me, don't judge me for anything. 
We shed our blood for our country!... 
Levin looked from the portrait to the original. 
Send me word if I can see her, said the prince. 
Remember me to him, be sure you do. 
Sought the light day, yet ever sorrowful, 
You're like wet straw today, 
Editor of the Globe: 
"You, Doctor? Why should I come with you? 
Only for revenge. 
So you remember me now, huh? 
You won't remember! 
Or you ask for Mr. Stanton or Mr. Howell. 
"It was just coincidence, that mouse showing up tonight." 
That's it, isn't it? 'Fess up, Edgecombe." 
He paused for a moment at the door of Coffey's cell, then ran across the Green Mile to Delacroix's cell. 
I reached out and clamped my hands on his shoulders. 
“I thought you were seeking a burden yourself.” “I seek a bur den?” 
They will say: “To Allah.” 
For a wonder, he did. 
Coffey said it was a lunch, and that's what it turned out to bea couple of sandwiches and a pickle, wrapped up in newspaper and tied with butcher's string. 
Sandwiches and a pickle but no sausages," Brutal said. 
He whipped off his spectacles and began to polish them furiously on his shirt. 
The kind you get if you're young enough to have kids still in school," Brutal said. 
Get up front," I said. 
I knew what was there, for one thing; for another, the past had suddenly doubled over the present, making one terrible image, threedimensional in its reality. 
What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug Would scour these English hence? 
Never had Buck seen such dogs. 
I've come to you on a matter of importance. And you sweep up, my good woman, for once in your life.” 
Oh, how ungrateful it was of me!” 
I call to him: 'Lebyadkin, bring the water! 'or' Lebyadkin, bring my shoes!' and he runs. 
“She treats him just like a footman. 
But he didn't realize Fred and George had put beetles in his soup. 
Don't rise Aunt Marge reached for her glass of wine. 
Was inflating Aunt Marge bad enough to land him in Azkaban? 
"But they'll catch him, won't they?" said Hermione earnestly. 
Ouchsorry "Hullo, Neville," said Harry, feeling around in the dark and pulling Neville up by his cloak. 
You should've said Neville did it all by himself!" 
They were at the top of the steps now, watching the rest of the class pass them, heading for the Great Hall and lunch. 
He smirked at Harry and disappeared. 
Harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear, then headed nervously for Professor McGonagall's desk. 
"We think he's trying to drown himself." 
Somewhere above him, Hermione whispered, Mobiliarbus!" 
As he moved all these things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying underneath. 
You never disappointed me. 
A visitor comes to see us. 
Harry looked round. 
'What on earth's she doing here, then?' 
She handed him a long, thin black quill with an unusually sharp point. 
Harry looked round at Umbridge. 
'Let's say next Wednesday night, then,' said Harry, 'we can decide on additional meetings then. 
'Only once,' said Hermione, stung. 
They looked at each other for a long moment. 
'It's probably full of Nargles, though.' 'What are Nargles?' 
He could not think. 
A reluctant grin spread over Harry's face as he watched Ron rolling around on the hearthrug. 
'How was it?' 
'Neville's gone for help.' 
'You — er — haven't seen Healer Smethwyck, have you?' 
Who've you been visiting?' 
Harry was separated from him by Mundungus and MadEye, who had dropped in to offer Mr Weasley their congratulations. 
'Control your anger, discipline your mind! 
Harry's feet seemed to be too big for his body as he walked towards her and he was suddenly horribly aware of his arms and how stupid they must look swinging at his sides. 
'Well, it does!' she said impatiently. 
'Good catch,' Harry told Ginny back in the common room, where the atmosphere resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral. 
Students beside them scuttled out of the way as Dumbledore appeared in the entrance. 
Or fractured her skull. 
"I turned her over on her belly and thumped her back," Rachel went on at last. 
We'll go back now." 
'What?' said Pigasov, winking his eyes. 
Good luck to you! 
The Lasunsky's servant brought it.' 
This will certainly be a surprise to you, especially after what passed yesterday. 
He is leaving Darya Mihailovna's.' 
Dumbledore's trusted me. 
Harry saw the boys' mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved. 
And this is Ron, our brother. 
"Oh, are you doing magic? 
It's really very selfish of you." 
"Goodbye," said Ron. 
The dog was guarding something.... 
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hideexcept perhaps Hogwarts. 
"These two are the Bludgers." 
He whirled around. 
There he was, reflected in it, white and scaredlooking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. 
"He's used to walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier." 
"Yeah," said Hagrid, glancing up, too. 
There are more important thingsfriendship and bravery andoh Harrybe careful!" 
She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered. 
"It's not poison?" said Harry anxiously. 
"Absolutely not." 
When he left the Hibernaculum, he would not see the cold Saturnian sky; that was more than a year in the future and a billion miles away. 
C'est ennuyeux," Sophie grumbled. 
As he moved down the hallway, Langdon wondered if at any moment he might awake with a start in his bed in Cambridge. 
Sophie didn't seem to hear. 
Sophie laughed, looking nervous. 
Sonia, Sonia take his money! 
"And you murdered her!" 
They were both silent. 
Madame Resslich's not at home. 
Harry's feeling of stupidity was growing. 
Harry's stomach leapthe was now tying for first place with Cedric. 
"I think he said he'd been too busy." 
Harry was concentrating on the Stunning Spell, which he had never used before. 
"My Lord, I am ... I am so pleased ... and so sorry...." 
The gargoyle sprang to life and jumped aside. 
"I was only joking...." 
He's just outside the door." 
"Come in, then." 
He had been inside Dumbledore's office once before; it was a very beautiful, circular room, lined with pictures of previous headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts, all of whom were fast asleep, their chests rising and falling gently. 
"We are not playing hideandseek, Harry," said Voldemort's soft, cold voice, drawing nearer, as the Death Eaters laughed. 
"Stand aside! 
Harry's hand had closed on Cedric's wrist; one tombstone stood between him and Voldemort, but Cedric was too heavy to carry, and the cup was out of reachVoldemort's red eyes flamed in the darkness. 
It flew into the air and soared toward him. 
"Tell him what has happened. 
Tell him I will be in direct contact with him shortly. 
Harry said nothing. 
(Qur'an, 51: 47) 
Bend down." 
It's a shame!" 
"What do you mean?" 
"Tell us, what more?" Dounia urged Raskolnikov. 
"Ce n'est pas ca, ce n'est pas ca," again interrupted De Griers. "Que diable! 
But he is a good fellow all the same. 
"Honestly, I don't care." 
You beat Harry Potter!" 
Behind him, a group of haggardlooking Ministry wizards rushed past, pointing at the distant evidence of some sort of a magical fire that was sending violet sparks twenty feet into the air. 
"A Galleon?" 
I'd pay five Galleons for that!" 
You threw it aside after you conjured the Mark?" 
"Amos, think who you're talking to!" said Mr. Weasley, very angrily. 
"But ze 'orses" "Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them," said Dumbledore, "the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his otherercharges." 
Badtempered," Barak replied. 
Over the months since she had joined them, he had seen her attitude toward him change until they had shared a rather specialized kind of friendship. 
What's wrong? 
Let it lie, Silk," Aunt Pol told him. 
Mostly rock. 
I guess Lieutenant Dan figured there's some things you can't change. 
A few months later, they invited me and the pingpong team to visit the White House. 
That's where we're going to find those shrimp, my boy! That's where we'll find them. 
Don't... 
Pollyanna nodded happily. 
'Go on, son,' repeated Uncle Vernon, moustache blowing about furiously. 
'Everything dark. 
(Qur'an, 42: 4950) 
You're pregnant, Mrs. Peck. 
But I'm getting no in strument readings!' 
Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes. 
He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache. 
And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the whole story had come out. 
"Percy's been acting very oddly this summer," said George, frowning. 
George groaned. 
There was a big photograph on the front of a very goodIOI)king wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. 
"Hagrid!" Harry croaked in relief. 
Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitchthey're three long poles with hoops on the end." 
But that's what the Seeker's got to do, because a game of Quidditch doesn't end until the Snitch has been caught. 
And whichever team's Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points." 
Eight o'clock sharp, both of you." 
Harry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest gloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a wellyoudidbreakschoolrules sort of expression. 
Harry didn't enjoy his shepherd's pie as much as he'd thought. 
"Do you think he was lying? 
"I know," said Harry, lying back in his fourposter and staring at the canopy above him. 
Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. 
195 "So?" said Harry. 
"I bet loads of people here can do it." 
Harry spun around. 
And then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happen when he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of the end with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel large enough to stand in. 
"Under the lake, probably," said Ron, squinting around at the dark, slimy walls. 
You've got everything you like. 
Jud matched him bottle for bottle, not talking much. 
He even walked wrong, Louis. 
Say three days. 
And you need us." Her eyes measured him doubtfully. 
Certainly. 
He, indeed, is a wonderful artist. 
Stupid custom," Barak grunted. 
Exaggerating?" Silk sounded shocked. 
"Just the truth. 
What's that?" 
I'll call if I need you." 
We want to go this way." 
I will find out some day how to make myself served as Caesar is served. 
(They laugh again.) 
Brother Bloat, proceed. 
He just grabbed the Reader's Digest. 
I'd like to see you try it." 
O, Tom, don't liedon't do it. 
We're too late. 
Not this night. 
I envy him for being better than I, said Levin. 
Harry hastily checked that the cloak was covering him and hay very still, staring up at the dark outline of the wizard he had hit. 
Harry reached the castle, slipped in through the front doors, and began to climb the marble stairs; he was very out of breath, but he didn't dare slow down.... 
The common room was deserted, and, judging by the fact that it smelled quite normal, Hermione had not needed to set off any Dungbombs to ensure that he and Sirius got privacy. 
The room was in semidarkness; the flames were the only source of light. 
Minibus hours:    
He wondered at himself. 
Langdon had made that mistake only once. 
I said, clapping my hands. 
'I don't' Harry began. 
'Nope, not jesting,' said Harry, his eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater,.looking for a weak link, a space through which they could escape. 
We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping our reward.' 
Cedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on having acquired such a superb replacement for his Nimbus, and Percy's Ravenclaw girlfriend, Penelope Clearwater, asked if she could actually hold the Firebolt. 
"Penelope and I have got a bet on," he told the team. 
"Sir Cadogan, did you just let a man enter Gryffindor Tower?" 
"But if you transform, Peter," growled Black, his own wand pointing at Pettigrew too, "we will kill you. 
Sweet darling! Margaret. Let me once! 
Therefore, even if they make some special effort, they gain nothing in salary, position or respect. 
In any case, in a society of ignorance, it is considered foolish for them to make any extra effort if there is someone else to do it. 
He said to himself: "Go on! 
Then what does it mean? 
You are playing at loto, aunt," he added. 
Give it back. 
Just a bite. 
Where are we anyway? 
He had taken good aim. 
But we must proceed in order." 
The AdvocateGeneral rose: "It would, perhaps, be better," he said, "if the young man were to tell us now whom he suspects." 
"Well," cried the President, "we wait for the name of the murderer." 
Loud murmurs of disappointment filled the room. 
This was the phantom that disturbed Daddy Jacques. 
Bernier, the concierge, whom I had stationed behind the donjonas he will explain himselfcould not see what passed in the court. 
Now, Monsieur Rouletabille, we await your explanation." 
The evidence given by the Berniers before the examining magistrate was to the effect that only one shot had been heard. 
His shirt collar was securely sewed. 
As he went out at the door he said: Siddy, I'll lick you for that." 
I ain't afraid." 
It only makes things a hundred times worse." 
It ain't a lie, auntie, it's the truth.

It does happen sometimes, if you make a man lose all patience, though even then it's rare. 
"Well, well, come in if you want me; I am here!" he shouted from the window. 
He shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet.
